<Text>Mattress Firm was the first store we went to to shop for a new mattress and we had the extreme pleasure of dealing with TJ. She is great! She was very welcoming and knowledgeable. TJ had us lay on several mattresses and we picked one we liked. Since this is a big purchase we wanted to look at different stores to find the perfect mattress. After three different mattress stores we went back to Mattress Firm and purchased our new mattress from TJ. We would highly highly recommend Mattress Firm and more importantly TJ!

Not only that she was professional but she just friendly, patient always reaching out to give you- trying to make sure she meets your needs. My wife and I were on the fence trying to decide which mattress to get and she helped us decide plus a huge discount, I ended with a very high quality mattress But within budget!

Taneka (TJ) was an absolute joy to work with. She was extremely professional, courteous and so helpful as she answered all of our questions and assisted us in finding the perfect mattress. We actually shopped around at a few different mattress stores but came back to Mattress Firm not only for their amazing selection but for the warmth, patience and wonderful customer service that TJ provided.

<Review>Excellent service! The staff is really professional and are very customer orientated. They never push you, they guide you to your specific needs. We ran into a small problem today when purchasing a mattress. They didn't have one available for us within a reasonable time so They started calling other stores to find it and got our mattress to us within no time! They were willing to go above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my experience. They are wonderful, kind hearted people that would give you the shirt of their backs.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>The manager TENEKA Johnson at the  Vacaville Mattress firm is the best. I stopped in one day to kill time. Sat down to talk about an adjustable bed. She made me feel so comfortable and went the extra mile to inform me of everything I needed to know. (that was a week ago Saturday) this coming Saturday I will have my adjustable bed delivered to my home. I am so excited. I am 63 years old and not ashamed to say, she held my hand and walked me through everything.
I would recommend That STORE to anyone. I live in the bay area in the East Bay and I’m having my bed delivered to me and Hayward.  she’s amazing and I appreciate her oh so much . Thank you 🙏🏼 TJ ❤️<//Text><user>111333932041703899675< /user>< username>

<Review>Amazing experience at the Mattress Firm here in Vacaville. JR was very personable, professional, and most importantly knowledgeable about the different mattress options. Spending a bunch of money on a mattress is such daunting task for any customer and I feel that he is very aware of that and makes the experience fun and entertaining without sacrificing professionalism. Check out JR, the mattress Dr., You won’t regret it. ☺️<//Review>< pics>

J.R. treated us great and made the whole experience enjoyable. He was understanding of our wild kids and did a good job of helping other customers at the same time. He made us glad we came back 7 years after purchased our first mattress here in 2012.< /Text>

They have a lot of options, more than 50 mattresses of different brands to try out. He had us try out 1 of each different firmness to narrow down what we were looking for, and then directed us only to what he thought we would like. He didn't try and sell us anything we didnt ask for or didn't  need.</Review>< Pictures>

Our experience was great!  We cane in to check out Purple mattress and after the excellent customer service from JR we left with a Beauty Rest Black hybrid. My wife and I actually agreed that it was the most comfortable. We hardly agree on anything. Thanks JR!< /Review>

<Text>We visited this store just wanting to look at the Purple mattress. We were immediately greeted by JR who, without any pressure, showed us each of the Purple mattresses. We then wanted to take a look at Tempurpedic mattresses and fell In love! JR took the time to explain each variation taking into account our sleep styles. I was very impressed with his knowledge of the product and the time he gave us to try the different products was great. Highly recommend JR and Matrices Firm of Vacaville.</Text>< user_name>

My fiancée and I purchased a mattress on 3/5/2020. The salesperson was Renante Bautista and he was very helpful. We were unsure of what kind of mattress would best fit us so Renante took the tie to go around and explain the different types of mattresses and the materials to us. We went around and tried a bunch of mattresses to see what we would like. I needed a mattress that was more on the firm side but not to firm (I have areas that are boney so to firm makes it hurt since I'm a side sleeper). We have had our bed for about 2 weeks now and I'm sleeping better now! a good mattress is soo worth the money!< /Text>

Came in on the last day of September, and the lovely guy that work here’s was very friendly and very helpful asked me and my boyfriend to try some beds out and also gave a good discount on any bed we wanted. You guys should check them out very reasonable prices. Coming back here when we need another bed.<//Review>

<Text>We walked into Mattress Firm and was greeted right a way with a Hello from TJ! She was very helpful and knowledgeable about all the mattresses in the store.  First and foremost; TJ wanted to know what my husband and I were really needing in a mattress.  To our surprise she took us on a tour after explaining to TJ what we both needed; our needs were the same...Good Quality, Comfort etc.  but we also had totally different needs also because of certain aches and pains which hubby and I concluded it had to be our old bed! Lol! Needless to say, it was a very knowledgeable and pleasant experience and we are overjoyed and anticipating the arrival of our new Mattress!  Cheers to a Good night of sleep in comfort! TJ was the Best in making it all come together for us and NO NEE to go anywhere else! Thank you so much TJ! Aloha from The Chong’s<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I came in on a whim, in desperate need of a new bed. I was approached right away by a very nice young man named J.R. He was very helpful with suggestions and explained the difference in mattresses. He also worked with me and my budget and gave me a what I wanted for a great price. I highly suggest coming here if you need a new bed!< /review>

<text>So me and my fiance went to the Mattress Firm in the Nut Tree Plaza and didn't have the greatest experience. It felt like there was more focus on selling a product than the customers needs for comfort. However that changed when we went and talked with Antonio, who was just so amazing that he was more interested in our sleep than in making a big sale. He wanted to make sure that our needs we're met. He even showed us the difference between each mattress and how it will help our sleep and comfort. The details we were given about the mattresses were outstanding. We were there for a whole hour and finally found the perfect mattress. When did come time for a price, instead of rushing into it, he recommended different ways for financing and told us to come back when we were ready. That was on October 18th and now, on November 16th, me and my fiance came in and met RJ who was so proud to hear of our amazing time with Antonio, who as it turned out, was trained by RJ. If I had to rate the store, it would be a 9/10 for it's smaller size. However, I would rate the staff (especially Antonio and RJ) as a WHOPPING 11/10. Both of them treat you more than just a customer, they treat you as their friends. Thank you both for the experience we got. And of course, I can't wait to fall asleep.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Me and my husband randomly walked into a mattress firm looking for a mattress. We were moving and wanted to upgrade our bed. Jerron happened to be working that day, and I’m not going to lie, I thought to myself “here we go, another sales pitch. Another salesman not listening to our needs”. I was pleasantly surprised at the service that Jerron provided. He listened to our needs and wants, and we ended up liking a mattress but did not make a purchase that day. We took his card and told him we would follow up with him, and we did! He accommodated our needs, and the mattress was delivered at our nearby mattress firm. If you’re looking for someone to genuinely listen to what you want, that’s Jerron. I would recommend anyone to go see Jerron!</review><UserId.>107081032101077274951< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

Just bought a mattress from kayla. First off , hands down best personal skills! I and my fiance went in on a Wednesday just to price them out. Kayla approached us from her desk ,which is across the room , as soon as we open the door. Kayla didnt unload a ton of question  or details. She actually  told us to go around and try out the mattress. When we were finally ready for the details. Kayla  was well detailed on both sleeping habits and the mattress  we wanted to purchase. Thank you for your help!<//Review>

We were greeted by JR, the salesperson at Mattress Firm Nut Tree Pkwy, Vacaville, CA.  He showed us a variety of models and gave us time to try each one while explaining the features and benefits.  The whole time JR, was very attentive and pleasant in assisting us.  And, he helped us find exactly what we needed.  If you are looking to purchase a mattress I would highly recommend that you have JR assist you.  We walked away as happy satisfied cutomers.< /review>

What a experiance! Came in and we meet with JR, He was so helpful  and knowledgeable! Didn't push us into something we didn't want, left us alone to make our decision, and even stayed late to help us get all set. I would totally recommend coming to this matress firm! Right next to grocery outlet, we even got to pick our delivery day, AND we didn't spend over what we wanted to spend, plus we got our son a mattress also!<//text>

ALEX IS AN ABSOLUTE CROOK......DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS! We just moved to CA and this is my first ever new car. We came in about a week ago, spoke to Alex and asked for tint no darker than CA legal limits specifying I did not want to get pulled over. I MADE sure he understood the importance of that and he very kindly agreed. This was the MOST important thing to me because with how things are in the world today I’m not comfortable at all with being pulled over by a police officer. We paid $170 and were told to be back after an hour. We came back a couple hours later to pick it up and headed out. Upon driving it home I notice it’s a little hard to see out of, so my boyfriend measures the front brow and it comes inches past the legal mark on the windshield. It’s late and I have a busy week so we decide to wait until I have time to address it.

Fast forward about a week or so and BOOM I’m pulled over going to work. Im in the position I feared most and had pleaded Alex to assure me I wouldn’t be in. The officer tells me that not only is the ‘brow’ not only too big but it’s illegal period in CA AND....wait for it THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE ILLEGAL TOO!!! I’m completely baffled and outraged at this point. I’m almost an hour late to work after this, trying to gather my emotions.

Fast forward to earlier today, I’ve had to travel up north for a family emergency and my boyfriend(who paid Alex) calls and it rings then goes to voicemail. He leaves a message to have him call him back today as soon as possible because there was an issue. It must be just a mobile phone because he almost immediately text replies back with ‘Can I call you later?’. I will attach the following couple of messages, in response, from my bf in in a screenshot. As you can see he immediately ‘read’ the first message and NEVER called NOR replied to him. So he disputed the charge and here we are on my first stop to tell everyone that wants to listen NOT TO TRUST THIS PLACE.< /Review>

Best place in town to get your windows tinted!

I have been here six different times and every single time Alex has taken care of all my vehicles. No matter how expensive the car!

My current vehicle was tinted 3 years ago by Alex and it’s still looks like he tinted it yesterday.

I recommend him to all my family and friends! They have not once complained about his customer service and his work.

Thank you Alex!!!<//Review>

Now for the bad portion of the review;

The online photo was not accurate to what the area actually looks like. Advertised nice suite at a shopping center and ended up a garage behind a shop on union ave.
Clean but hard to get to.
The work it self as far as the cut and stick was good, however the problem was the dirt from the windows wasn't properly cleaned and the film attained copious amounts of dust from the window because of it. The door window panels weren't removed to lengthen the film to insure no peeling. End result was relatively good work ruined by lazy work ethic on cleaning dust off windows before applying product. and not properly installing door windows.

Recommendations:

1)Clean windows!
2) Take protecting layer off inside the car not outside to avoid dust collection.
3) if your going to measure using outside window to measure, properly clean that too before touching film to it.
4) if you want word to spread about your business you need to supply good business to bring back costumers for repeat business and to tell others. Good luck in your endeavors. As for this costumer I won't be returning.</Text>< Pictures>

Called to get a quote, was told they will call me later with a quote. Called back later that same week to schedule an appointment, only to have the receptionist talk to me rudely.

PS: my review is based on how you treated me while I was trying to get a quote.< /Text>

The place was supposed to open at 8am and it's already close to 9:30am and the owner keeps texting me saying he's almost here and there is a locked gate and I am not able to enter. There are other cars parked outside on the curb as well WAITING. Seems pretty unprofessional. At least give me an EXACT time of when you are arriving so I can run all my errands and come back. Beyond irritated! Then he texts me saying he's got a personal life and another business and stuff. I don't see how any of that was my problem but if he cannot manage the time with his "personal life" and "other business" he should adjust the hours so people aren't wasting their gas and time! I respect the hustle and understand things come up but better communication would have made this situation so much better</Text>

I am in the business of flipping cars and most of them need tinting done because of the bakersfield heat. Alex has become a good friend to me and not only does he do great work, he also is very communicative when I am in need of his tinting expertise service. He has always responded very quickly and is very punctual. It is common courtesy to contact him before just going to his shop because he  does have more to his business than just cars to tint. He begins at 8am also to complete work on residential homes and also, commercial building who hires him. He does take walk-ins, but atleast call first, so you can better plan your schedule and also, so you let him plan his as well. It's common curteousy to call first and check his availability. Knowing how all my dozen or so experiences have gone with this business, some people on here leaving reviews must be plain miserable. I bet nothing ever pleases them and they probably expect everyone to bow down to their petty selves, making all servicers of businesses bend over backwards for them to have what they want when they want. These people are not very nice to say what they did. I wouldn't go anywhere else for this service, hands down best deal and best guy to let work on your car. Trustworthy and kind with deligence to get every job done flawlessy. Never have i ever had to go back, never any bubbles, just perfection at great prices. And he is very quick and professional at what he does. I have enjoyed the company for the many vehicles he has tinted for me. Thank you Alex and keep it up, you are a prime example for human kindness. I wish you luck in all your life's endeavors. You are a very special person. And you shine continue to shine bright. Bakersfield is a soul sucking city that welcomes toxic people and loves to see them wallow in their own misery. Love and light, my friend. God bless.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Very good quality service. There is nothing more refreshing than taking your things to a person that looks like they know what they are doing. That was the case this past Friday when I took my brand new KIA Optima for window tinting. The job was professional, fast and I still haven’t had any issues with it. I would recommend it to anyone, anytime!< /Review>

I went to him in December to get my Honda civic's two front windows tinted, and let me tell you, Alex was super fast and super cheap and my windows look awesome!! If you need your windows tinted I really recommend you go here, the quality of work done is superb and far superior to any others that you will go to. Save time AND money, go to Hills Window Tinting! I guarantee you will be 100% satisfied.</Review>

I was looking to get the windows tinted on my car and after seeing the reviews I decided to try this place. After calling for a rather long period and no one answering , I decided to stop by . At 8:30  they were still closed . I asked a person their if he knew what was going on and it took him all tge effort in tge world to even acknowledge my presence . He decided not to stop his work and shout answers of which  I couldnt hear so I left . A few minutes later I got a call back from the owner asking me to come back by after he got done whatever he was doing . Given the time management issues I decided to go any where else. Customer service and time management are nonexistent here and im not going to wait around all day for you to get to me after doing chores .  So I went somewhere else , got helped with a price and made my apointment for the next day  with no issues right away . Take note Hills window tinting and apply some customer service.< /Text>

Today is September 26, 2015 and I just got my windows tinted by Alex here at Hills Window Tinting and they turned out AMAZING! Who would have thought that window tinting can look so good haha! Its right across the street from the kern county fairgrounds and the price is AMAZING compared to all other shops. This was the most affordable that I found in town and I am not dissapointed. The outside is a little rough around the edges especially since its across the street from the fairgrounds, but DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU! To be honest I was a little iffy because the price was almost to good to be true for great quality work and the outside appearance made me wanna go to a big name shop to get it done, but I am SOOOO glad I didnt haha! I have learned not judge a book by its cover. Alex is the perfect combination of business and friendly. He is so nice and explains everything in detail. Great customer service and gets it done in half the time of other shops that I have called for a fraction of the cost (depending on what you want) still affordable and WORTH IT! Highly recommend to others! You wont be disappointed I promise!< /review>

<Review>I have used Radial Tire for going on 40 years.  Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff.  If they don't have what you want they will get it next day.  I went in today for a 15", load range D, tire.  (15" tires and rims are sort of "passe" now-a-days).  But they had a 15",  load range E, tire in stock.  In 15 minutes it was mounted and balanced and I was on my way.  Good folks there!  They are all Latinos and Spanish is used in the shop until they realize that you don't speak Spanish and then they use their perfect English.</Review>< Resp>

The replaced the tire mounted and balanced and only charged $35. I was out of there in 30 minutes. I am impressed with their professionalism and value< /text>< pics>

Service has always been good. For some reason the last two times I called in for a quote and I brought in my vehicle, the price has not been the same. Be sure you get an accurate quote. I did get a discount, but no where near the price I was quoted.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Anywhere else > radial tire. I bought a car that had been sitting for two years, I told them that and said please look at everything, change the fluids and let me know what I need to fix. They told me two belts needed to be changed so I had them change those, then they said everything else looked good. They said the fluids looked good and didn’t need to be replaced? So they didn’t change them. They released the car to me and 45 mins later I’m overheating on the side of the road. I take it to a different shop bc obviously radial tire didn’t REALLY check anything out. The first thing the new mechanic said was THIS CAR HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS. 2 other belts needed changing, four different parts were leaking coolant and oil, the engine just looked bad, there’s a knocking in the engine and all the fluids looked murky. Radial tire literally didn’t inspect anything. I would give this place a 0 star if I could. Disappointed, for sure never going back to them. Advise literally anywhere else over radial tire<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809ac0ab271ae2cb:0xd0ba66ed329935ce<//gmap_id></record>

They got the job done saved me money. All the workers are knowledgeable and kind. One of the cleanest waiting rooms I've been in at any kind of shop. I was in and out, fast.

I don't post reviews very often. In fact, this may be my first.  Today was the second time I have visited Radial Tire of Elk Grove in the last two years. Both times it has been for a lawn tractor flat tire. Both times the service was fantastic. It is a big shop and very busy. Both times I was tended to immediately and my relatively small problem got their full attention. It was a five star experience both times.</Review>

I just want to tell everyone that Radial Tire of Elk Grove is the best Automotive Repair shop I have ever been to, I love the People, the Technicians and the prices, They do quality work for reasonable price,
John, Moses, John Jr, Fabian, Carlos, and all the Technician are really nice people.

Great work! Great price! Great people!</text>

Just want everyone to know how much we appreciate Radial Tires.  They service our fleet with care. And today, they went beyond the call of duty to assist one of our technicians stuck in Sacramento.<//Review>

<review>These are nice guys andI generally appreciated how they treated me but they also managed to break a part on my truck that is only put on by hand not with a tool. I was very disappointed when I saw this and it has caused me to quit using this shop.<//review>< Pictures>

Fast service, friendly people and great prices. Other shops told me I had a leaking oil pan gasket and it was going to be 500-600 dollars but Thavian at radial tire found that it was an oil filter housing gasket instead and it was a lot cheaper and fixed the problem.</review>

<Text>I've been going to Radial for years and you just can't beat the service from those guys. They have been there for a while and I don't even blink when when they do my service and I'm an ex mechanic and they are honest with me. I turned all my friends on to them and they all use them. They have off brand tires which are cheaper, but last just fine for me.</Text>< pictures>

I cannot express in words how Radial Tire has helped us in several different situations from our cars, to our boat trailer, and our motorhomes.  Recently the help they gave us on our motorhome was a long story, but I have never seen a company in their field care so much about their customers.  They are trusting, kind and genuine people.  I have never met one person there I did not like.  Everyone you talk to is like talking to a friend next door.  We wouldn't think of going anywhere else.  Thanks guys!!< /review>

After a purchasing a damaged item here and calling them with the complaint, they offered to help me out. I returned to the store, explained the issues and they replaced the item for something of similar value but better. Great guys and super patient!</text>

<Review>They sold me a pouch of rotten, moldy, rolling tobacco and refused to even let me exchange it for a fresh pouch. They also refused to check other pouches and are continuing to sell moldy tobacco. I know this sounds crazy but its real. I can’t believe it myself.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place rocks! And is always my go-to. They are so helpful and knowledgeable and they have two stores one up Vermont and one down Vermont. I prefer this location though even though the guy at the other one is very very knowledgeable. They have a super large assortment of everything you could need or want that is needed to vape or smoke and are always so helpful. Thanks guys 🙂< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great prices, great help, great location, huge parking lot. What more can you ask for lol. Went in for my usual 100 ml 3mg nic bottle of vape juice and paid 19 bucks out the door. That is a great price. I have only seen a 100ml bottle cheaper at one place and its a little too far of a drive for me so this place is perfect for me, much closer and same prices.< /Review>

Its smoke and vape shop where you never can buy any smoke. They constantly out of cigarettes. Look at the photo, where white shelf which supposed to fill with cigarettes is empty!!!</Review>

This is very good place with huge selection of glass banks and pipes on top of that they have huge selection of lightors and torchis. basically everything that u need for your a fun time u can find in this store.
I highly recommend this place.
And it doesn't matter if you are a budget customer or a high end one.  They have a variety from $ and too $$$$</Text>

Imo really decent selection and fair prices, literally half the price then the other vape shop up the street.  Its a smoke shop not the Ritz Carlton people need to chill about customer service place is always packed with like two dudes working who are fast and efficient.  People also need to realize that while stuff is cheaper online the shipping is also super high and super slow.  I would gladly pay a few bucks more to just have it in my hand that day going here.<//text>

<text>I walked in and found what I was looking for. A nice salesman wrapped it up. I paid and thanked him then left. I was in their no more than 2 minutes. Granted it was the day after New Years, 9:30pm. So hardly anyone was in the store. They had more than one salesman. The store has a variety of everything. It was all well stocked. This smoke shop is better than the one a few blocks away from my home. It was a short train ride and shorter walk to the smoke shop. Well worth the trip, I'll be back!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2c0ac43b8fecb:0xdfff927d47a47595</gmap_id>< Pictures>

Very Bad, Rude Customer Service here. Why do you have a lotto machine when half the time you ignore your lotto customers. Everyone knows always have someone at the cashier or leave your other customer for a second to do lotto quickly since there is a cut off time to buy tickets. You never tell a customer to go next door. That's JUST horrible and I will tell my Kaiser employees not to buy from here anymore!!!!!! You should hire more help so all your customers can be treated fairly. I will gladly buy my incense, lotto and sodas from another nice smoke shop. Bye Bye Deuces Smh!!!;(< /review>

I came here for a loan of $1,200 and was greeted and treated with respect from the workers. Vanessa, Melissa, and Mario were all great people who took care of application. I was in and out of there in less than 30 minutes with my check in hand. Great and quick service.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) If I could give it zero it would be great. Pay a Lyft to arrive on time and be able to apply to
Loan they offered me, my name is Cristina Gallardo. I have a loan with opportunity and how I know that the macarthur store closes at 7pm on weekdays, I went and it was 6:48 and they were closing when the manager closing a curtain told me that it was already closed to return the next day. Explain my emergency and left without listening. How this coup lets us down and we are the clients that have made it what they are today. Check cameras and they will realize that they are closing before the time they say on Google.

(Translated by Google) Oportun has ignorant types of people for customer service. If one calls and you say you want to make a payment from another person, they tell you you cannot because you are not the right person. We need information to be able to send a link so that you can make the payment, but it must be to the person who is on the credit. 🤔🤔🤔

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent customer service. And they offer a new loan with which you have only half already paid for your current loan. The interests are somewhat high in my opinion but it is a good option in fast and effective loans because they do not get as much requirement. Only with your work and a little information. I like this loan option and the customer service in this store is very good

(Original)
Muy buena atencion al cliente. Y ofrecen un nuevo prestamo con que tengas solo la mitad ya pagada de tu prestamo actual. Los intereses son un tanto altos a mi opinion pero es una buena opcion en prestamos rapidos y eficaces pues no te puden tanto requisito. Solo con tu trabajo y una poca de informacion. Me gusta esta opcion de prestamos y el servicio al cliente en esta tienda es muy buena</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) It has no parking and even if you already have credit with them they lend you what they want not as they say that every time you ask for the next one they lend you more.

No tiene parqueo y aun que ya tengas crédito con ellos te prestan lo que quieren no como dicen que cada que pidas a l  próxima te prestan mas.</text>

Insomniac really knows how to please the people. The drive-in events are a blast and I highly recommend if you are looking for a good time that you attend an event here. It was very well organized, security was a breeze, and the view from any area was nice. The sound quality is great and there is very minimal traffic leaving.<//text>

< Review>
Nice place.  They need to enforce the no talking while the balls are being called and why they have a bar open to the public in the middle while bingos being called is beyond me. The people there talk to loud. Security is great and some of the floor runners are okay but they need to explain the games better and the caller needs to pick a speed and stay there it makes playing very difficult when he speeds. Up slows down speeds up again 3 seconds is the general rule i think</Review>

This place is so cool! Honestly never thought  there was a place like this in SB. Only bother was that the food took way longer than I think it should have. My friend ordered something with carne asada in it, and they ran out shortly after he ordered. They didn't tell him that they were out though or offer an alternative, they just let him wait over an hour, but I think at that point he asked for a refund.<//review>

Small venue for rodeos and concerts. But the small size is perfect for that though. All seats are good there. Food joints were awesome and grabbing a beer was easy and no long lines.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Bingo was a lot of fun.  Good sized crowd.  Reasonably priced.  Little bit of a line at the snack bar, food was pretty good. Staff did a goid job keeping up with specials. If you used to go to San Manuel, its closer and cheaper than Morongo or Pachanga.
Thursdays are a little more relaxed.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcaccbd354ddfd:0x4f2c6a101f5981ba</gmapID></record>

This place is a hidden gem in San Bernardino! Terrific sports bar and wagering facility. Great place to get drinks with friends, watch sports, and bet on the ponies!< /Text>

I go here for Steelers games, if you're a fan it's the largest group in the I.E.. Always a fun time. Very spacious and family friendly. Only gets 2 stars because the screens flat out suck. Old projectors on old 4:3 aspect ratio screens. Even the small flat screens around the rooms are outdated and poor quality visually. Then there's the food, which is just, disappointing. The service is spotty at best. Pleasant servers but just not organized at all. Like I said, only reason I come here is because of the Steeler fan comradery, otherwise it needs a loooooooot of help.<//Text>

<Text>I wish I could give 100 Stars!!  This family run business is top notch. My seven year old twins absolutely love going here. They beg us to take them. I have seen a huge improvement in their athleticism and confidence. All the parents and kids who go there are super friendly. Glad we found this place. Highly recommended!!!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Power of Leverage is a top notch gym to learn Jiu-Jitsu. I have quite a few friends in Jiu-Jitsu since 2011 and have watched them teach and have visited other schools and have even shopped around different Jiu-Jitsu schools.  I have friends that are black belts that have their own schools. When we came to Power of Leverage to visit however, it just felt like the right new home for our family.

My husband, myself, and my 2 older girls train in Jiu-Jitsu.  We had been at a previous school for 4 years and then felt our family needed a change.  I had met Professor Kelly at a competition a couple years ago and he opened his doors for us to visit. What I loved is hearing my 2nd daughter (who was struggling with Jiu-Jitsu overall) say that she likes it here because "Professor Kelly is nice to little kids and helps me out a lot."  We are about 11 miles away from this school, but find the commute worth it for the quality of teaching. Their coaches are very engaged. Professor Kelly and Mrs. Maya take great care of their gym and know all the kids by name and even their parents! They have a way of talking to each person and child and making them feel important.   They have built a great team and truly make it feel like family (not a dysfunctional one).

You know how they say it takes a village to raise your child? I found the village that I want to be a part of.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP06oHbbsHlVBtbrsmTMUzy1OpccDUTPesutiyo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRE-IZnHwbb36CEoEE-6T8nsqSDUto-wFNqbzP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtibAfx4rQe2M7BW2-S4Qw9H-u3f2KBFstl_Ne=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUuIjZCg966ZdlG5hRme8vGVyc_nuBgtkpIIf4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<user>102927225856553313436</user><Review>So this review is for my husband and I. He started going there to get some extra exercise aside from his standard workout. He started taking the boxing class which was so reasonably priced and a total workout! He liked it so much he started taking our 11 year old too. They found it to be a bonding experience. I saw them having so much fun, and after some initial coaxing from my husband I started going too! It is such an amazing workout. Professor Kelly and Professor Todd are great instructors and really find a way to get you motivated. Maya is super sweet, caring, friendly and honest. Remi is so good with the little ones, keeping the focus of a 4 and 5 year old is like herding cats and she is fantastic. POL is not just a place to learn Ju Jitsu or boxing it’s a family. We were welcomed with open arms by every person we have met thus far. Everyone that trains there is friendly and happy to teach the newbies. Joining the POL family has been the best decision for our family!!< /Review></record>

<review>Great program for kids of all ages and abilities.  Builds confidence, discipline, leadership, and sportsmanship.  Professor Kelly is a great teacher/mentor, the kids all love him and work hard for him. You will not find a coach anywhere that is more dedicated to their students.<//review>< Pics>

❤️ Professionalism, Respect, Values

Power of Leverage has had a positive influence on our family. Our son started training at POL because he was getting bullied at school.  He started going there to get some basic self-defense skills and to build his confidence. He quickly fell in love with the coaches and the discipline, and he even began competing in the Jiu Jitsu competitions.  This experience has given him the confidence and security that every child deserves.  The program is so special, his dad began training and competing with him.  What started out as a father and son bonding experience, quickly turned into a whole family bonding experience.  The coaches and Mrs. Maya are special people and take great care in making sure their students and adults are healthy in both body and mind.  They are professional and instill the values that we do ourselves.  The students who train there are respectful and courteous, and the workouts are top notch.  We are at POL at least 5 days a week, it’s our second home and family. Our 2 younger sons watch their older brother train Jiu Jitsu and boxing at POL and they can’t wait to start themselves.  Also, our family travels with the academy for competitions which turns into memorable family road trips.  We have grown to love our POL family and can’t imagine not spending time with them on and off the mat.  Being a part of the POL family was a terrific decision and one that our family will never forget.  We look forward to watching our family get older with theirs.<//text>

<Review>Wonderfully awesome place for young and old alike to hone their ju jitsu skills in a competitive yet encouraging AND VERY FUN environment! Professor Kelley and his staff are excellent at what they do and both my son (the student) and I (parent spectator) always look forward to going to class. Great place to sharpen self defense skills, strengthen cardio and muscle development and make friends!!! I highly recommend this center!</Review>< Date>

< review>
We've been looking for a Jiu Jitsu School for our oldest son, 9 . He had been to a few others before going to POL and this time we were looking to sign up our daughter, 7 and youngest son, 5 as well. It was hard to find a good school that was affordable with three kids. But with POL they're very reasonable and we were able to get the whole family in, my husband and I included.  We feel super blessed to find a place the whole family can attend. We all look forward to going to our Jiu Jitsu and boxing classes weekly . Everyone at POL treats you like family. Professor Kelly, Coach Remi, Mrs. Maya and Professor Todd, are all friendly, helpful and nice. They all keep you motivated and make it fun. We were recommended and definitely highly recommend checking them out.<//review>

<Text>We were originally looking for a martial arts studio for our (then 3yr old) son to get his wiggles out while learning some discipline. While both our son & daughter took trial classes, our daughter was the one who LOVED jiu jitsu & is continuing her training with Professor Kelly. As their parents, we love the family atmosphere & instantly felt openly welcomed by all. While our daughter continues her jiu jitsu training, our son has since started his boxing training with Coach Todd & Professor Kelly. We could not be happier with this gem of a place in HB! Our kids have gained confidence & discipline while truly enjoying their classes.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1607479142760, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback and for giving us the opportunity to teach your kiddos!!'}<//Response><gmapID>0x80dd2704cae97c33:0x7f2b258c0eaa6aaa< /gmapID></record>

We signed up our daughter for classes to get more exercise and to learn self-defense. She is getting so much more out of her classes and we are learning a lot more about her in the process. She loves going to class and often practices on her own in our house.  She has grown so much in her self-confidence, mindset and work ethic due to what she is learning at POL. She adores Professor Kelly and all the POL staff. We have also gained a community of people that love and support our daughter unconditionally through POL and we will be forever grateful!< /text>

My siblings and I tried out this place last year and we left the first day. Comparing to the other dojos we've been to, Professor Kelly was extremely arrogant and purposefully would embarrass you when sparring with him. His daughter is also very arrogant. All his students were entitled showing bad sportsmanship and the whole environment seemed very judgmental and not welcoming. I'm not sure if he deletes his negative reviews because this place is so overrated. At least the environment was clean.</text>

POL has been a like a second family to us. My older daughter, my son and husband participate in the classes.  We started a year ago and they welcomed us with open arms.  Jiu Jitsu has helped my kids with strength, endurance, coordination, confidence and responsibility.  My son especially needed extra help with learning new things due to sensory issues and a weak core.  The staff and Professor Kelly have been so patient with him and have helped him so much.  We are so grateful for POL!< /Text>

Our 5 and 4 year old looooves their jj days of the week. The main instructor p Kelley is so good with the kids; funny, loving, and great sense of command. It’s a large class full with kids of similar age range that makes it very fun for them. Very well staffed with assistant instructors so despite the large group, things are very well run and organized. Coach Andrew is a gem and was so good for my son when he first started. Thank you coach Andrew!!! Love watching the kids grow in confidence through jj.< /review>

<text>We are so incredibly thankful for this Jiu Jitsu gym! My son is 4.5 and on the autism spectrum. The coaches are so fun and patient with him while they are teaching him how to have more awareness of his body and how to participate properly in class. My 9 year old daughter saw him trying class and had to try for herself. She is now in love with Jiu Jitsu and loves going to class as well as competing. Professor Kelly and Maya are two of the most amazing people who have built a gym that is so welcoming and encouraging and a place where kids can come and grow.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Mrs. Maya & Coach Kelly is the best. I made the right decision earlier this year when I chose them mentor my son Ivan. Prior to practicing at Power of Leverage my son had asthma every time the season change, he was always afraid to approach people. Through Prof Kelly coaching Ivan have grew confident and self esteem. I love love the Power Dual Maya / Kelly.❤️<//Review></record>

<Review>My husband and I signed our girls up for the class and it has been one of the best thing we could have done for them. They are learning so much about discipline, building confidence, and making new friends. The POL family are the best! The parents and family are very supportive and encouraging. Prof Kelly and Mrs. Maya are amazing with the kids and the girls enjoy and actually look forward to the classes! I recommend anyone that is looking to put their kids in sports to try this out. They have adult classes too! Love the people and place - can't rave about it enough. Just join and give it a try!<//Review>< GmapID>

As a beginner in jiujitsu, I wasn't sure if it would be for me. But upon entering one of Power of Leverage's adult classes I am beginning to fall more in love with the art. Power of leverage is a great studio filled with folks that will treat you like family. Kelly, the main jujitsu teacher there will help you discover your true potential in the art and work with you to push you out of your comfort zone. Since he is a father of three kids, he is very good working with children. I will definitely be coming back to this studio when I want to train again.<//Text>

<review>If you're looking for a family friendly BJJ school, don't spend your time looking anywhere else. After looking at a few school around HB and CM, we decided on POL and we couldn't be happier ... family friendly and positive atmosphere. Prof Kelly and his wife Ms. Maya are great with kids and parents. Caring and supportive, but also serious when it comes to training (As a teacher, I've seen what can happen without structure). Also more and more dads and moms are getting on the mat!!! ... including me. Now just have to get mom to join 😋. And the training is excellent ... Just look at POL standings at Dream and World tournaments ... 1st place!!!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1574360639592, 'text': 'Thank you Paul!

I am extremely satisfied in the decision to sign my boys up for Jiujitsu. Professor Kelly is very patient and Kind. He has taught my oldest so much and given him the confidence in his skills. Not only as a competitor but an amazing teammate to his fellow students. Power of Leverage has become part of our family.< /review>

<userid>117660436095766293480<//userid><text>A couple months ago I was taken aback by my daughter who pointed out her 2 year mark since beginning Jui Jitsu with the Power of Leverage. Throughout this time she has experienced an array of emotions, but above all, she has felt the love, generosity and support of truly caring coaches and peers.
Needless to say Professor Kelly sure knows how to bring out a smile in his young students while bringing out the best in them. I particularly recall an occasion while at a tourney when my daughter faced her first young male opponent. My daughter was intimidated and reluctant to fight. I vividly remember Professor Kelly's manifestation of emotional support as he did everything in his ability to boost her self-confidence. Suddenly after many tears and comforting words, her anxiety was under control and she was willing to fight. She fought under Professor Kelly's guidance and outmatched the young contender.
Truly, as a parent, I embraced the life lesson and sentimental value behind it all. I couldn't have asked for a better coach than Professor Kelly!</text>< response>

My son and daughter have been training  for just under one year at POL. They train five days a week most of the time and  have improved significantly. Professor Kelly is great and keeps the atmosphere fun and interesting for the kids.  However, make no mistake, it is very professional and if the children are playing around and not really training, he will let them know.  I consider Professor Kelly very well versed and competent in BJJ and as such he is very confident in his abilities.  I consider this a very sought after character trait when shopping for a martial arts instructor. I have to disagree with the review (is it even real?) labeling Professor Kelly as arrogant and self centered.

Bottom line, if you want your children to learn BJJ from someone who cares about the art, I would highly recommend POL.< /review>

<Review>Our children have attended Power of Leverage for two years.  They have blossomed under Professor Kelly's guidance.  Watching them build skills and confidence has been a joy.  Power of Leverage is not just a business, it is a family.  We are so thankful to have Professor Kelly and Miss Maya in our lives.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This place is excellent for people and little people of all ages. I have been taking my little man here for over a year now and he loves it. Professor Kelly and his staff do a great job woth the kids. Teaching them about jiu jitsu as well as life lessons and teamwork. The adult classes are great as well. Great group of people working hard to learn and better themselves. I recommend this place to family and friends all of the time.<//Text>

Power of Leverage has been such a great experience for my family. We currently have our two boys ages 5 & 7 enrolled and they now eat and dream about Jiu Jitsu. Professor Kelly and the coaches really make the process of learning the art easy so a very young child clearly understands. By the 2nd or 3rd class you'll find your child reciting the drills and calls out of the blue. Our two sons recently competed in the Jiu Jitsu World League tournament each placing 3rd place in their divisions, all within 2 months of just starting the sport. I'd recommend POL to any family looking to gain meaningful development in their children.<//review>

<text>Coach Kelly and his students were very welcoming. I flew out to California for a short vacation from the east coast and sparred with him. They train in all aspects to be well rounded in ju jitsu (such as stand up, takedowns, ground, and competition training). I definitely recommend training at this gym.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have watched this studio from its inception and am clearly amazed at how Coach Kelly inspires and motivates his students in learning the art of Jiu-Jitsu. He is very serious in his teaching but he also has a great sense of humor which makes his students laugh every so often.</text>

< Review>
Professor Kelly's passion for the art of jiu jitsu and his love for his students are apparent every single day!!! Our three kids ages 8, 6, and 4&1/2 have been coming here for the last year and a half. The skill sets they have learned and relationships they have built with their professor and their fellow jiu jitsu friends have been priceless!!!  As a parent, Power of Leverage has connected me to a community of encouraging and supportive parents that continuously make us all feel like one tight knit family! Power of Leverage is truly a gem!!!!!< /Review>

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a great art and discipline and tool for self defense. We have our 6yrBoy and 4yrGirl in it and they love it. Professor Kelly is an amazing teacher who really trys to understand each child's unique strength. The Power of Leverage is a great place to come and learn and train for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in a fun and motivating setting.<//text>

This Place is GREAT. We were introduced by a neighborhood friend. She 10 was hooked and couldn’t stop talking and sharing what se was learning at the Jiu Jitsu studio and invited our kids to come and train with her. After the first day both my 8G and 10B year old kids were hooked. Not only is the instructor professor Kelly is great with the kids but he has all of the kids with more experience trained to welcome and help the newer kids. What A great place. The kids get knowledge of the art of Jiu Jitsu as well as a great workout. My kids have been working out five days a week at the studio as well as practicing at home what they have learned. They do train adults as well. Thanks to everybody involved in putting together such a wonderful program.

Just an update!!! It’s been four months now. My kids still love this place and have made new friends and feel like part of the "Power of Leverage Family” They’re training has shown in skill and strength more than I ever imagined. Thank you professor Kelly and everyone on the Power of Leverage Team</Text>

Jiu Jitsu, power of leverage in fountain valley by fresh and easy is so awesome, like you have no idea... When my best friend told me to go try it out, at first I was like sure I'll do it but it might be boring or I'll probably get killed. But then, during the first class I found out that jiu jitsu is so much more than your typical martial art because it's FUN. And USEFUL. You learn so many ways and techniques to protect yourself and no matter what size you are, you can do it. I'm one of those people who would lose to a fight and get tossed thirty feet into the air but jiu jitsu literally will save my life. It's all about leverage, not weight and not muscle power. If you know the right techniques you can do it. I mean, I learned how to flip over people twice my size! I've never been a fan of martial arts until jiu jitsu. Coach Kelly definitely knows what he's doing and I learned so much in just one hour... I honestly from the bottom of my heart suggest you try it out!! Seriously, this class will save your life. (Not to mention there's a gelato place right next doors so you can cool off after class) :))<//text>

Not only that I was over looked for a couple who didn't want to buy anything. Only then was the sales lady willing to even speak to me. I had $1200 in my pocket to spend.

I am starting to lose my faith in Daniels we have purchased greater than 15 pieces of jewelry from them and have had great service until recently. They had changed the settings in one of my rings after 3 months I noticed one of the prongs was lifting on one of the smaller diamonds I took it back and had to pay an additional $35 because it was past their “limited warranty” period. I took it back again in May to have the same prong repaired picked it up May 31 within a month the same prong is lifted AGAIN took it back to the same store and they’re charging me another $35 I asked why do they keep having to repair the same prong and was told they would take $5 off the charge like seriously!!!! I have a desk job and shouldn’t be having this issue guess it’s time to find another jewelry stores</review>

<review>Went in today to buy earrings for our baby girl, they had few selections so we were looking, no one really acknowledged we were in there until a few minutes later, after we got approach by the young gentleman working, when asked if we could see the ones we liked he kept repeating the price before showing them to us as if the price was too high and out of our range after looking at a couple he simply turned us away by telling us to go across the mall to Claire's that they had what we were looking for 🤦‍♂️ at that point we simply walked out and went to another jewelry and got our little one her first pair of earrings .</review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1546903049497, 'text': 'Thank you for advising us of your recent visit to our Bakersfield store.

I am so annoyed with them!  I just attempted to pick up my ring my husband purchased for me last week that had to be sized.  They charged 85.00 for the re sizing which was bad enough,  then, gave my ring to me wrapped in a little piece of tissue paper and tried to send me off.  I stayed to try the ring on to make sure it fit, and noticed 2 of the diamonds missing!  I brought it to their attention and the employee Ismael tried to tell me how they damaged it trying to size it.  He said " Oh don't worry, we will take care of you".  Now, I have to wait longer!  Then, I asked him, so, you are going to discount the bill right? He said "Oh no.  I said well how are you going to help then?  He said " By fixing it"!  Such poor customer service!  I could not believe it!  Then, he didn't even want to give me paperwork for the new repair!  I am going to pay off both accounts we have with them and Never shop there again!<//Text>

Everything everyone says is true. My husband bought my ring from here and anytime I would go in for a cleaning they would ignore me for 15 minutes plus then when they would help me it was always with attitude, rushed and as if I was a bother to them. That is no way go treat and keep customers. Waiting 30 minutes plus for a ring cleaning is ridiculous. There are much better jewelry places go there and save yourself a headache.<//review>

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE! This place has the worst customer service, the employees are rude, management is never in store, according to staff they are only available from 10am-12pm and refuse to help. I was double charged and its been over a month and they refuse to refund me. I have went in on 3 occasions to speak with someone and they ignore me and say they cannot help. They are horrible to deal with just do not care about customer service at all. Save yourself the trouble and head somewhere else!< /review>

Do not buy from here! I received a ring from them in August of 2014, and had it sized  in October. In March of 2015, I went to get it cleaned and the employee told me that the band had not been sizes right and would need repairing because the band would break. It was a year later and my band broke. It was supposed to be ready last night, but it was not there so I will have to wait to pick it up. Horrible service< /text>

< Review>
I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY FROM HERE. They were oh so nice while we were picking out our six thousand dollar purchase. I left happy and excited. Now every month when I have to go there to make my payment....(which is not convenient first of all) theyre rude ALL of them. They never have a nice friendly attitude. Oh and if you want your ring cleaned be ready to wait awhile. The last time I got my ring cleaned the lady drops my ring picks it up doesnt apologize or even act like she did anything wrong. You pay six thousand for something and have it dropped on the floor and Im positive you will be upset like I was. It wasnt dropped in the hand off. This woman walked off with it and dropped it on her way to go clean it. Then as she kindly goes to help the other couple pick out theyre purchase and set up their payment plans ,my ring sets in the cleaning machine for about twenty mins. Im already upset...my husbands upset we ask another lady to get my ring out. Its supposedly  against their policy. Another ten mins goes by. All three of my children are getting ancy and me and my husband were as well. I walk up to the sales woman who mind you six months earlier was the sweetests. I ask for a manager no manager on sundays she says. I explain that the lady dropped my ring and I really dont care if shes the one who put it in the machine so she has to get it out because she dropped it in the first place and couldnt even give an im sorry nothingggggg. So I really dont want her to get it out and I dont want to wait to her while shes setting up payment plans witb this other couple. I just wanted my ring and to leave and get on with our day. It took almost a hour to make a payment and get a ring cleaned. To be treated like that was not right and this isnt just a one time deal. This is rvery time I go to make my payment. Dont buy from here they tell you one amount then tag on other fees without asking if you want the insurance. You ask them to take it off and ypu have to wait a whole month. So we were paying an extra 30$ for something we never asked for and something we were never told about. Dont get fooled by their nice guy salesman ways because you will end up dealing with the rudest employees until your debt is paid off.<//Review>

I have been using Daniel's to build my credit score back up.
How do I go and make a  $200 payment and when I came back it was as if I had only made a $150 payment.  I can get shafted at a big name chain and for cheaper.  I'm over y'all Daniel's.<//Review>

<Review>Me and my husband had a bad experience in this store here in Bakersfield,So me and my husband purchase $6000 then we ask them how much they charge for the ring size and the manager said $165 and that is expensive.And the manager said he gave us for free well according to the store said if you purchase over a thousand then you will get the second one for free...THe Manager is very very RUDE and I don’t know why he gave write off to one of the staff .The staff she help us she’s very helpful and friendly it should be to that manager they will gave a write off not her....The store manager here in Bakersfield is very rude...you guys need to talk to him..I wish we could return all the items that we purchase from this store and never come back here anymore....</Review></record>

The service at this location was good. The location however is now close forever. The reason is probably it was visited by homeless people all the time and they got very few customers to begin with. This place is no longer open.<//review>

The district manager doesn't return messages when I try to complain about this, and I've filed two complaints with the health department in the last year or so.  They're also very bad about acknowledging customers when they walk in the door. Sometimes I'll stand there for a few minutes waiting for service while employees see me, but no one says hello or lets me know that someone will be there to help me soon. If they aren't the register person, they just ignore me. This is at its worst when there's only one person working both the walk-in and drive-thru registers. They're not good about keeping the restroom stocked with paper towels either. Overall, this Taco Bell location provides a very mediocre customer experience. The only good thing I can say is that when they do speak to me, they're friendly.</Text><Name>Lorin Salm< /Name>< rate>

First time at this location and services was good,  but the tacos had very little meat inside the shell. More lettuce than meat!</text>

Drive up at 12:30 and all the lights are out.  I know they don't close until 1:00. Pull in and wait for several minutes before I decide to leave.</Text>

<Review>Lousy food. The inside of my burrito was cold beans. Cheap on the cheese and sauce. Taco had very small amount of meat and was minus the cheese but too much lettuce.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>Not bike friendly... I went inside the taco Bell carrying my bike so I wouldn't dirty there floor. Needless to say I was instantly kicked out for having my bike. It funny that I kicked out for wanting to spend my money,yet you have people making drug deals in the restroom and homeless people showering in there restroom as well I will not be eating at this location anymore....<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c296e65c5be10d:0xff75e25615524ccc</Gmap_id><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I've been eating her for almost all my life I hate how so many ppl lie on these reviews each person has their own job not everyone there is a cashier so have a little patience they are human and have other responsibilities they are not your personal service and for all those who say that this store messes up their order you are given a chance to ask them to repeat the order its your fault again they are human ppl make mistakes chill</Text>< name>

(Translated by Google) you have to ask for everything, napkins sauces etc, they have it inside, you have to
wait for someone to open the bathroom

tienes que pedir todo, salsas servilletas etc lo tienen dentro, tienes que
esperar que alguien te baya abrir el baño<//review>

<text>Came here yesterday  may 15 Saturday at 6:00PM. I had ordered online. My order was already 10 minutes after the pick up time and I was running late. I asked the fat  female cashier ( not the skinny cute one), how much longer it will be and she responded with “ you can cancel the order if you want.”
WHERE IS THE COSTUMER SERVICE. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. AND YES I DID CANCEL THE ORDER AFTER RECEIVING THAT STUPID UNPROFESSIONAL RESPOND.</text>< pics>

maybe you guys should hire more people if you guys are busy. Don’t even waste your time and money. Food is not even that good. Everything is just too oily except for the carna sada fries.

And the cashier was rude. I think she was having a bad day or something.< /text>< pics>

I am not to happy been going here for about 6 months only had one mess up. Everything was fine up until tonight. They close at 9:35 i called in at 9:10 asked to place an order over phone for pick up. They told me no but then i turned around and ordered from Grubhub at 9:25 and they are making the food. Thanks for making me spend 10$ more dollars to get food to night also i am the person that always tips you 5$ in the drive through. No more tips from me.</review>

<Review>Well I finally tried this place. Got some rolled tacos (supreme) & an order of churros. The rolled tacos were ok but the churros were all raw dough in the middle. How can you not know how long to fry dough so it’s not raw in the middle?! Skip this place.</Review>< name>

I chose them because they were advertising free delivery if you spend $15. I regret my decision. Rolled tacos were so over fried and hard as a rock all the way through except for one that was wet and soggy and not fried at all. So strange. The bean and cheese burrito tasted like sulfur?? I’ve never had such a disgusting and strange experience with a taco shop. Usually you can go to pretty much any taco shop and get decent food because this is San Diego. Ugh. Waste of money.<//Review><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

Best shredded beef chimichanga I've ever had! I literally got it crispy and wet like i like it and it's the only place that made it that way out of every other place I've tryed a chimi. I'm a chimi fan and its really hard to get both crispy and wet. Seasoned was a cherry on top. .. This place also won my heart cause their shredded beef was actually seasoned and really good! I've always loved them! Even if I'm the only one! I recommend them and I go!  Never got food poisoning! Yet!<//Text>

the last year, and especially the last 6 or 7 months, they've just gotten awful. food is mediocre, you'll get your choice of burned tortillas, or soggy undercooked fries....overcooked hard-as-a-rock rolled tacos, or a mushy wet carne asada burrito. 😐
the prices have gotten outrageous, while the portions and quality have tanked.
you have to repeat yourself multiple times, and then they still manage to get the order wrong or incomplete. everyone working there seems to have an attitude, especially the ones working the drive thru.
super disappointed, this used to be one of my favorite places. 👎</review>< pics>

Food is good, but they often forget something. Like today after sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes, I drove off without any tortillas for my fajitas.</Text>

Ordered 5 rolled tacos in the drive thru. The woman asked what salsa I wanted. I specific said “just red” and ended up with one green and one red. If your not going to listen, at least give enough of both types to compensate for the lack of listening.< /text>

They gave me the wrong order, the price is twice what I would have paid down the street, the salsa was watery and had no salt, and the cashier sounded confused and untrained. The food itself tasted unimpressive for what it cost. Will not be going back.<//Text>

I have been going to this specific taco shop since 2005.  They have amazing food! This could be a 5 star rating, but every single time I order they mess up, or leave something out.  VERY disappointing.

<rate>1<//rate><text>I bought carne asada fries , and I really regret not checking them before i drove to my house , because when I got home and saw the food I noticed right away that the fries where really burnt and smelly like old cooking grease , I called to let them know the problem and of
course they wanted me to go back , but I'm really tired from work and don't have the energy to go I'm so upset at the cook for not caring about making quality food for the customer's. Check your food before leaving don't trust them.<//text>< pics>

But they forget at least one part of my order, about half the time. I pay for it, and never think to check the bag till I get home but they forget things. The food is great, like I said. And Id give them 3.5 stars, but I just dont like how it's a 50/50 shot that I'm getting what I ordered.</Review><name>Rebecca Morales</name>< pictures>

I just moved to El Cajon from "the Central Coast" (north of Santa Barbara...).  Well I ordered a chicken [shredded not grilled] burrito + rice & beans on the inside of my burrito + wet with green sauce (mojado verde).  It tastes GREAT!--Very flavorful...
Also, I think the prices are just right.  Where I used to live, (about 300 miles north of here) the same burrito would've cost the same price--but the size & quality were both not as good..
They got my order right the first time too.
So far, so good--in my humble opinion. (I'm
a fairly picky person by the way).
Maybe I got lucky (based on some of the reviews that I read), but I think they deserve a lot better than a 3.6 star rating!
It's been my favorite shredded chicken burrito in the area in the 2-3 months that I've been here!
Nuff said.</Text>

I asked the lady for help choosing what to order since I never ate at any Mexican restaurant, however I don't eat any pork products,  so she suggested ham and egg and she said their ham is made out of beef after paying she went to the back and made egg and potatoes sandwich because ham was pork and not their special beef. I didn't complain however the potatoes weren't done at all they were super hard (almost raw...) the sandwich had zero amount of salt or any seasoning, I do not recommend eating at this place even gas station food is better.<//Text>

This was the first time I've ever been to this Panchos it's a nice little place in a bad little neighborhood the people are friendly I'm sorry they got stuck in the neighborhood they get stuck in we usually go to the ponchos on Main Street over between greenfield and pepper Drive but this one was on our way home that night and so we stopped in here the food was quite good like I said the neighborhood's not that great so we don't go there very often but the actual ponchos is a good place to go</review>

The quality of preparation and size of portions are a step up from comparable taco shops. This means you'll find the prices slightly higher and the wait time slightly longer. Call ahead of time if you have trouble with waiting, or to hear pricing. The food is worth the wait. Even at the closing hour food is still fresh looking and tasting. 10/10 would smash again.</Text>

The prices were right , the food was  great and lots of it -with friendly, helpful staff along with a singing cook. My wife was very happy with her order and couldn't finish what she had,  as did I. Those folks who did not enjoy their meal must have been there on an off day because our experience has been a positive one. Oh yeah--there's quite a menu to pick from to boot.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

After moving to Ramona California which is approximately 25 miles away I went without my favorite burrito the ChiCali burrito and when I was back in town thought I would stop by and order one after paying $10 for my burrito and driving to lakeside before getting on the freeway to come to Ramona I decided to take a bite of my burrito and discovered I'd been charged $10 for a bean and cheese burrito . I had to drive all the way back to El cajon and have them make me the correct one. I wanted to get home on time this made me go out of my way by 8 miles and more importantly cost me a half hour and put me in 5 oclock traffic. I didn't get home until 6:15 after leaving the First time at 4:15 which would have put me home at 5 pm. I didn't get a refund which should have been given. So I didn't even get to eat my food fresh and hot! Never again, thought they were over priced anyway< /text>

<userid>115833855495693919287< /userid><review>Taco shop is right around the corner from us and after years of not going there because the food wasn't all that. We started going back because of the convenient location but almost every trip there our order was wrong in some form or another. The guy who takes the orders everytime we go there we have to repeat the order several times and he still seems to get it wrong. After today's experience with him once again not understanding my order, order being wrong and his horrible customer service when I called to inform my food was wrong and I'll be coming back. The new food was made right but I didn't enjoy it because the red sauce taste burnt. We'll stick to the location on main. Never going back.< /review>< Pictures>

IF I COULD RATE 0 WITH NO STARS I WOULD!!!
For $9.50 enchilada's & a side of rice was NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME ! The cook gave me nothing but veggies in my enchiladas which I hate! I only want chicken which I've had before but tonight was disappointing!
DO NOT RECOMMEND this place!
A) DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
B) SUPER EXPENSIVE
C) FOOD NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY
ID LOVE MY MONEY BACK... TO BAD... ITS A WASTE OF GAS & HUNGRY SO I ATE THE FOOD THAT WASNT WORTH MY MONEY THANKS ALOT PANCHOS , YOU GUYS SINCE TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE AS THE YEARS GO BY ! THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT IM COMING HERE.

This place is way to expensive and the food is greasy. I ordered 2 fish tacos and they didnt have any kind of crema. When i asked Laura doesnt fish tacos come with crema she stated yes its their and since i stated to her where she got an attitude and because of this she served everyone in my party their food but when my order came out she refused to serve me my food and literally called me to go get my own plate. Worst place ever food is not good nor is it worth the price of 60.00 i will never ever eat their nor recommend it.<//Review>

ive experienced nothing but racism and brown power here so i quit going! Used to like their meat, but the unfriendly cashiers in the drive through that barley speak or smile got old. Not to mention the long waits in drivethrough lines and wrong orders from the lack of communication! why we voted for donald trump. come here and you will see why!</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Well I do like the friendly workers! But today I ordered a carne asada plate and I get home put on my kitchen counter and pour something to drink and sit down to open it and as I start eating there wasnt just a piece of hair it was more of a hairball in my carne asada meat.  I know it wasnt mine because my hair was all pulled back. So I dont know how it got there so the only thing came to mind was maybe the meat was dropped on a dirty floor and someone picked it up and put it in my plate without notice. It freaked me out a little so Ill take my business elsewhere.<//Review><Date>1531451992160<//Date>< UserId.>

Exceptional Mexican food! California burrito is my favorite anywhere in SD. Its huuuuge, and has tasty refried beans (which is awesome). They use angus steak, and cook to order, so the wait can be a bit at the drive thru. Why not plan to eat inside and enjoy a seat and the salsa bar?

If I still lived closer I'd be 5 lbs heavier than I am now.</review>

< review>
First time going to Los Panchos , I asked vegetarian burrito.
The woman working at the time confirmed it was a vegetarian burrito.
Once I was home I obviously bit the burrito a couple times and taste something weird but since I didn't grow up eating pig lard I didn't think anything of it but since it tastes different, I called Los Panchos  and I was told they refry their beans in pig lard.

As a vegetarian I am disgusted that they would do this. Why name something vegetarian and comfirm its vegitarian if it is not.

I have no doubt but their food is probably good since they have good ratings but I just wanted to let the future vegetarians know the BEANS contain PIG LARD.

Vegetarian; a person who does not eat meat, and sometimes other animal products, especially for moral, religious, or health reasons.< /review>

Worst panchos ever. Very bad customer service (rude as hell) and what really got me the lady asked me how much salsa you want I asked for a handful of both being I had a big order she then gives me my bag and said it's all there. I noticed my bag was double knotted to where I had to physically rip it open and she gave me 3 salsa after she lied to my face and said she gave me it all. Why? What a P.O.S<//review>

Order food for my whole family, got home and 3 of the meals were wrong. When I called to bring food back and have it fixed she said the manager won't do it but shell give me a 10% discount. So they wanted me to pay for the meals I didn't want and give me 10% off of the meals I wanted that they had to fix. Paying twice because you messed up the order is unacceptable!

Laura was very disrespectful and not interested in being helpful. She gave lots of attitude and said she won't fix the meal for free just because we won't eat it. Well of course I won't eat it I didn't order it!

NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN!!</text>

Pretty much the only people in El Cajon I go to for Mexican food aside from my wife. Great tasting food, large burritos, cashiers who always smile, and a cleaner interior. The food may take a while sometimes, but good food takes time. I must mention the variety of tacos and burritos as well. There will always be something to fit your mood. While my wife prefers the adobada tacos, I'm a huge fan of the cabeza tacos and california burritos. Just had some yesterday and I'm craving some again.< /text>

< review>
The best  service ever.  Nick our salesperson was such a great kind helpful sales man.  We got the best deal no hassle. Fastest time spent buying a Ford Raptor for my son.  We will do life time sales with Nick.  Eddie our finance person was also excellent.  Explained everything thoroughly. Both had excellent customer service and very personable.<//review>

If I could rate this dealership has zero I would. I know that salesman are sometimes a little Sleazy and who sell their soul just to make a sale I have never in my life been treated with such disrespect, blatant disrespect. Nor have I ever seen anybody willing to take advantage of an elderly couple the way that Jeff has. There were other salesmen and finance managers involved however Jeff was the root  the disrespect and complete deception. Thanks to the staff at Swanson fahrney Ford my elderly parents who suffer who suffer from dementia and are constantly under the influence of prescription medications and not able to make sound judgement nor sign contracts, purchase a vehicle that is a piece of junk and that they cannot afford. I pray that I'm able to assist financially enough to prevent the damage that Jeff has possibly done to my parents. When I called to discuss this issue they ask for my mother's permission to talk to me, she gave permission. I explained what the issue was to Ozzy the finance manager who said that he would take it to the owner mr. Fahrney himself. The next message that I got was later that night when I had asked my mom if anybody had called and she told me, "oh yes they did call and tell me that they cannot talk to you because you are not on the contract". So even though my mother gave permission but them to speak to me, they refused my calls because they know that they did wrong and they know that I was not going to stop until they made it right and they didn't want to lose that sale. If you value your family and your bank account, don't buy Swanson fahrney Ford. Had it not been for my father being so upset and grief-stricken begging me to Let It Go so that we can figure out how to move forward, I would have been fighting a lot harder for this but unfortunately respected my father's wishes. Today was a different day he decided he wanted to fight but instead of them talking to my parents he waited and talk to me separately and not nicely either I reminded Jeff that coercion was illegal in many instances and he simply said he didn't understand. Yes when you manipulate the situation and convince an innocent party to buy something that you know is not good for them, especially when you were asked face-to-face by their caregiver to call her if they happened to come back and you refuse to do so, that is a form of coercion as well as a display of many other horrible morals. Lastly and not even half as important as the damage that they've done to an innocent elderly couple, they let them leave with a filthy car and when we brought back today to have it detailed and left almost as filthy and with extra scratches on the dash. Just vacuumed a bit and rinsed the dust off. I guess I still thought there were decent salesman around since I had such a wonderful experience recently (at carmax) but that was my mistake for assuming. This post and these pictures are 1.5 hours after leaving swanson fahrney ford. No extra trips, just brought them home to rest.< /text>

Car searching was a rollercoaster so I went to Fahrney with an idea of what car I wanted but still walked in a bit unsure until I was approached by Steven Cervantes and things just clicked. He made me feel comfortable and let me express my concerns in what exactly I wanted and needed. He talked to me with respect and did everything to make the experience easy and smooth. And now I have a car that I love and not only great for me but for my family!< /Review>

Had a great time experience at Ford.

1. Since we are in the midst of a pandemic I appreciated the cleanliness.

2. The quick and informative response from the team was greatly appreciated.

I have been hesitant on getting a new truck, as many of us on the search I had a ton of questions, so kudos to Bryan Lopez, the Salesman, for being responsive and knowledgeable to each question I threw at him. Highly recommend asking for him if you’re searching for a new truck and want someone that knows their stuff and isn’t pushy.< /review>

Steven Fuentes made our buying experience fantastic. He went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and that all of our questions were answered. I have never worked with someone as patient and dedicated as Steven.  The detail people are another story! My SUV went to the detail department the night I purchased it and the next morning. The exterior was still filthy and my interior was still a mess. It's sad that I had to pay a  professional to get my SUV looking the way the detail shop should have.< /Text>

Purchased our truck the same day we began to look. Raymond Pinkston lll was the sales person. I spoke to him first thing in the morning. He sounded knowledgeable and professional over the phone. When meeting with Raymond my wife and I felt very comfortable. He listened to the needs and wants we had for our vehicle. No pressure, easy transaction. We are very happy with our purchase. Thanks again for your help Raymond.</Review>

Very Unprofessional.  I have purchased a few cars from them over the years - I am a 15 year Kingsburg resident. On 3 different occasions I have gone in and had them run my credit to purchase a car.  I told them each time to run it only once.  They end up running it 8-15 times over many days.  I even wrote them a letter and filed a complaint with the better business bureau to remove the hits to my credit report.  Absolutely no response.  They just did the same with my son.  If you want your credit score reduced significantly come here.  The only time they did not run it more then once when I had the salesmen promise he would pay me $1,000 if they ran it more then once.  It only got run once that time.  When you call and object they say "you signed a release we have the right" - what about what the customer wants? - very unprofessional. Look at the bbb.org website - other complaints as well - here is their response to a similar complaint to mine "Unfortunately we can not remove the inquires because you have signed a credit application authorizing your credit to be ran for approvals. " - In these tough times of COVID people losing their jobs etc you would think they would care more about a customers credit.

First complaint filed in 04/15/2018

They were nice but there are things they DONT tell you about buying a used car that you notice after. For example, i was told they throw away the floor mats. Who does that??? I could have sworn they were in the car when i test drove it. Not a very good detail clean on interior either. Also sold it with an empty tank and wouldn't fill it. Phillip was a great guy. I'd ask for him if youre buying a car. Got us in and out.</Text>

I wanted to share my Facebook review here as well for those who don't use Facebook much.

Can I just start off with if you go to Fahrney Ford to ask for Nick Comaites (I hope I spelled that correctly). My boyfriend and I are generally quite terrible when dealing with salesmen (we prefer to be left alone) but when it came down to looking at what we wanted Nick made the process simple and straight forward. We had a trade in and we're a bit worried in dealing with that extra step but he didnt even bat an eye, the trade and sale was honest, quickly done (as we had to get to work), and didn't feel overwhelming.  10/10 would recommend. Thanks again for all your help! We're extremely happy with the service and purchase.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I’ve purchased a few new trucks from Fahrney over the years. I just purchased a 2021 Ford F-150 4X4 truck. As always I had a wonderful experience once again. The salesman, (NICK COMAITES), was great! Very professional and answered all of my questions. Very honest, polite AND WAS NOT just looking for a sale. He actually walked me through all my options, giving me breathing room.  I highly recommend Fahrney to anyone looking for a good honest deal, and do yourself a favor, ASK FOR Nick COMAITES in sales!!!

Thank you Nick Comaites, and all at Fahrney for a pleasant transaction.</review><user>100451969067198711037< /user><gmapID>0x8094f03e8032ffd7:0x8f1c14cf601a869</gmapID>< user_name>

<review>We ended up waiting for like 20 min before anyone even checked on us.

We found the truck my wife and I had been looking for but it seemed so difficult to get them to do anything. All the tires needed air and even after repeatedly telling us they would put air in the tires and put some gas in we had less then 1/4 of a tank when we left and the tires were 10-13 psi lower then the recommended pressure.

On top of that they tried to tell me they discounted the sticker price for us when the sticker on the car was already LOWER then the price they 'adjusted it' to.

If anything changes I'll update my review. Thankfully I'm at least happy with our truck. Chris was the salesman.<//review>< pics>

I highly recommend Fahrney Ford and our sales associate Jonathan Moreno.  This dealership has a great selection of new and used vehicles, but still gives you the welcoming small town feel.  Jonathan was very thorough and patient with us and really listened to what we were looking for.  There was never a feeling of being pressured to buy.  Mario (in house insurance agent) was great and ended up not only saving us on our auto insurance, but also our homeowners.  Finally, George (finance manager) was a pleasure to deal with and was helpful in all aspects of our purchase.  I will be purchasing here again in the future.</review>

I found everything I was looking for at one dealership.  I had such a great experience at their Toyota store with my salesman Travis Jones that I decided to buy my wife the Mustang she's been wanting for so long.  Got a great price too. I would definitely recommend the Fahrney Auto Group to all my friends and family.< /review>

< review>
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!! Scam artists!! Rip Offs!! They discriminate!!  One of the worst experiences ever trying to buy a car. Very arrogant, very judgmental, one of the finance managers named Grant is the absolute worst to deal with. Grant didn’t even introduce himself he just started talking down to me openly in the showroom floor in front of everyone. I had to get his name from the salesman. Honestly don’t waste your time with this dealership. I drove 6 hours round trip to try to buy and we left because of Grants poor poor service. Bad vibes all together, horrible attitudes. Dealership offered to pay for gas and food if we went back lol. Tried to work with them but they are way overpriced. They raise the interest rates and terms to get more money for the cars. Complete waste of our time. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy from this place. Everything about this place is not good. We should of known it was bad when they called us halfway there to tell us the car was sold only to call us back 10 min later to tell us it’s still there. Very very unprofessional.
they were trying to sell us Mustang GT for supposedly 44,000 with 5800 down @ 849 a month for 72 months lmao that would of been 62000 for the car. They also tried to sell me a Shelby 40,000 down @1200 a month for 72 months adds up to 125k yea ok. Not a chance.<//review>

He is very personal when it came helping us, and above all I felt that he was doing everything for us to give us the best rate possible. I shopped around to find the perfect car  through out the Central Valley and because of him I was able to find what I was looking for a a great price!! Once again thank you for helping us Luis we mend more sales men like you!< /Review>< pics>

They all worked together as a team to meet my mothers price limit and sold her a car she feels comfortable in. I believe the young man that made it all happen is named ADAM. Again I will recommend family and friends to Selma Fahrney Ford in Selma ca. Thank you all for Great customer service.</text>< pics>

This is probably the worst ford dealership or dealership i’m the central valley... I used to go here for oil changes but since have changed to Lithia Ford of Fresno due to their poor customer service. I called the parts department for a simple question and was on hold for almost an hour, I kid you not!!! How is this place still in business??? Their car prices are outrageous too.<//text>

Once we found the truck that was right, it was an easy process to drive away with it. Jonathan and Adam were very knowledgeable on the specs. They worked hard to get me the right deal. I’m very happy with the customer service and the quality of the truck i purchased.< /text>

Fahrney Ford out of Selma California is the best. I first was greeted by Jonathan who was very friendly and made us feel comfortable. He understood what we were looking for and followed up a few days later with the right vehicle for us. Richard Soliz who is an amazing person took over when we came back to the dealership. I dragged my wife to come look at the car and who was not interested in a new car. After Richard spoke with her about all the benefits of the new vehicle she slowly started to have buy in about buying a new vehicle. After she drove it, she loved the vehicle. Richard was able to work with the Finance manger to get us a price we could live with. Thank you Jonathan and Richard for making the process easy.  I would highly recommend these two individuals.< /text>

In spite of all the stress I put on myself, this ended up being a wonderful experience! However, it's important to note that most of the positive that came out of this experience was  associated with my salesman, Rick!   Rick is knowledgeable, patient, efficient, and most of all, treated me like I was family! because of my excellent service, I have three friends who will be visiting Rick in the next month, shopping for a car. Congratulations to this dealership for having someone like Rick as representation.</text>

<pics>None</pics><review>I recently purchased a Ford Fusion from Fahrney Ford and I’m very pleased with my purchase beginning from the excellent customer service from Alvaro to the very competitive prices the offer there. I went in there with something in mind, I explained it to Alvaro and he did a great job finding a car the best suits my needs. If you are ever in search of a car go in there and ask for Alvaro, he’ll put your needs first.<//review><response>{'time': 1579712995385, 'text': 'So glad to hear it!!

<Text>I have been trying to cancel my warranty on my vehicle for the past few weeks and I have been brushed off to the side constantly. After providing all of the necessary documents, I was not told how much my refund would be and how long it would take. My vehicle doesn't have a lien holder and I was told that it would take two months to get a refund. This is absolutely ridiculous. When I cancelled my warranty at a different dealership, it only took a week to wrap it up entirely. It seems like no one there even remotely cares about customer service at all. Absolutely horrible experience.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1595976096668, 'text': 'Thank you so much Alex!!'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8094f03e8032ffd7:0x8f1c14cf601a869</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

All of my questions were answered by Jacob. I am usually not comfortable dealing with car dealerships, however he made the process easy and pressure free. Will be recommending  Fahrney to friends and family!< /Review>

<text>Had an overall smooth process in the buying of our new car was a little bothered with financing especially Eddie because it seem like you had no interest in selling us the vehicle and having the attitude that if we didn’t purchase it someone else would. Left a really bad taste in my mouth was the fact that He had no interest in helping us find the second key fob that came with the vehicle. Some to make a long story short I have to go purchase a new key for $400 on a vehicle that I spent over $40,000 on. At this point I would not recommend in the near future</text>< pics>

<review>Eddie is the best. He was not overbearing at all, He gave us time to look at 3 different trucks. He stayed with us the whole time we were there and answered any questions we had. He was very polite and checked in with us after we left, to see if we had any further questions. When we returned to purchase the truck,Eddie was very accommodating through the whole process. Eddie emailed us after our purchase to be sure we were satisfied with our purchase.  I have and will recommend Eddie to everyone. Thank Eddie for all you did.</review><GmapID>0x8094f03e8032ffd7:0x8f1c14cf601a869< /GmapID><response>{'time': 1566579466342, 'text': 'Wow, this is so awesome!!!  We love Eddie!!!

<Text>See Jonathan or Adam at Fahrney Ford in Selma  for local deals. They were both up front and straight forward when it came to pricing for a new F-150. They found a vehicle that both met my criteria and fit my budget. Thanks again Fahrney Ford.<//Text>< Pictures>

We recently purchase a truck from this place and Jacob Whitfield was our Sales person. He was very professional and patient with us, not at all pushy which was awesome experience. We definitely left satisfied with our purchase and experience with this dealership and our salesperson. Definitely recommend Jacob to anyone that is interested In a new car.<//Text>

<Review>I’d like to thank the salesman named Jonathan for helping me find a car that fits all my needs and more .He showed me quite a few cars that fit the criteria I explained ,he Was not  over aggressive ,assured me my needs and wants in a vehicle was priority and put me at ease knowing I was driving off in a vehicle I chose and happy with , rather than one that was forced on me like i’ve experienced in the past. I highly recommend this place as all staff was professional and friendly , Thanks again Jonathan< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The sales man that I was working with was Isaac he was very professional and had the answers to every question i had. I have a low credit score but he found a way to get me into a car that I love. I definitely recommend going here if you have bad credit, they all make  a really good team and can most likely help you !! it was a very enjoyable experience. Thank you Isaac I'm so grateful for your time and patients.< /text>

So my husband was looking for a work car so he went online and saw this Honda that fahrney had so he called them to make sure it was still there which it was, he then went took a drive over there to see it.. well the car salesman he had talk to on the phone told him yes we can get you in it and blah blah blah so when he got there they were trying to put him in a car he didn't want so he walked away... the next day he got a phone call from there asking why he didn't drive away with the car he told them it want the car he wanted so he then went back again the next day and got a different salesman name Chris.. he was very good very understanding and very professional.. my husband then drove off in the Honda he wanted all thanks to Chris... I would highly recommend Chris to family and friends. Thank you Chris<//Text>

<Text>I recently Visited Fahrney Ford looking to purchase a new GMC truck. I came in with a late Model Toyota Tundra which I absolutely loved but was time for something new.  Jacob Whitfield made our Truck Shopping experience very comfortable as if we had knew each other for years. Jacob showed me pretty much every type of new truck that the Fahrney Group carries. We test drove GMC, Toyota, And Ford trucks in various styles and options. After seeing everyone option available we drove away with New Truck that was everything we wanted. Thank You Jacob for having patience and for making our experience great.  If you are looking to buy a new car or truck I highly recommend Jacob and the Fahrney Automotive Group staff.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1580751621961, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the review Chris!'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Came in just to stop and look around. Rene S was awesome. Very informative about each vehicle we looked at and was very tentative to my husband and I. Definitely recommend working with him. If you don't think anyone can do anything for you, get with Rene. He's willing to actually put in the work instead of blowing you off. 10/10!!</review></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Personally speaking as a former employee, I don’t recommend working here as a mechanic unless you want to see the company screw you over on hours. I had multiple incidents when reviewing my paychecks where I was missing large amounts up to $166 at one time. I would call them out on it in which they’d have me another check in a couple days, but that would just mean my next check would be double taxed for their error. I have paystubs that prove it. The work areas we would work on were not safe and I’d let the boss know about it until one day I just got tired of it and was forced to call OSHA they appeared one day and they took care of what needed to be taken care of I still didn’t feel a lot of things were right when I’d see them I know a few coworkers that ended up leaving right after me because of how sketchy and poorly we got treated.<//Review>

Had a few issues with the truck on the lot that we chose. It ran out if gas on the lot before the test drive and resulted in having to be checked by the mechanic and needed a fuel pump but Jeff and Mauricio were great by getting us in another truck which was awesome because it was the orginal one we wanted to begin with. 4x4 with lift kit already installed. overall great experience!< /review>

<review>Thank you Alvaro!  The journey of finding a new car was practically stress free because of your low-key approach.  It was a long process, but Adam and Steve hung in there too, until the deal was done.  Patience and kindness go a long way.

<review>First time customer and last time customer. Went in for oil change and for recall work. When done on the way home my car horn wouldn't work. Stopped and tried my car alarm and it wouldn't work. Called them about the situation because it worked before i went there because i beep the horn when i picked up my friend and dropped her off before i went to the dealership. Talked to Mike and he said it didn't work when you got here so we cant help you. Yes i was upset because i knew that wasn't true. Went to a local mom/pop garage and the man fixed it in 5 minutes and didn't even charge me, very nice. Said something that the wires were undone. Something that someone had to do and they couldn't come undone on there own. So i knew someone at the Fahrney did it, no i dont think they did it on purpose maybe accidental but still they try to hide the fact they did it and didn't want to fix the problem. No i dont recommend this SHADY place.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I was on a very tight budget and they worked well to find me something I liked . A Late model plus what I wanted . Then when I had it serviced it was really reasonable and fast. I had to wait and they were done in a bout an hour. So far I have had nothing but a great experience</text>

I went to Fahrneys to check out the GMCs. I was greeted and welcomed by Fahrneys representatives. I got to be honest with you, I was very pleased and happy with their patience support and understanding. They knew what we wanted, and patiently worked with us until we found the perfect truck. I would like to specially  Thank Jacob, for being patient, and for taking the time to work with me and my wife, and for giving us a great deal. Now we are happy driving and showing off our GMC. Thank you Jacob, and thank you Fahrney, you guys Rock!</Text>

Love my new truck! And my salesman Eddie Aguilar was awesome! Thank you for staying way past closing to find my perfect truck! You guys are awesome!........until a month and a half later it came time for service my check engine light came on the service department is terrible!!!! I dropped it off on Friday morning and was told I would get a call by 4 to update me oh the status....well no phone call and when I called Friday no one knew the status on it so Saturday morning I called again and still no one knew what was going on with my truck! After two more phone calls they said I could come get it and when I picked it up my steps didn't work anymore and the items I needed fixed were still broken!!! Worst service department ever!!! Do not recommend taking a vehicle to them!!!<//Text>

My 2015 Mustang GT had the water pump go out at 3:30AM on a Monday night. I had the Ford used car warranty, Ford paid to have the vehicle towed nearly 27 Miles. The Dealerships service department specifically Brandon was great about explaining my warranty. Ford covered the repair under the warranty. They were quick with the repair and I had the car back on 3 days later. One of the big things I liked was the Dealership did not try to up-sell me services the vehicle does not need. I've had that happen at two other dealerships. But Brandon was honest and forward about the service intervals and times.<//Review>

<user_name>1875 Remington Army .44-40< /user_name><Time>1577308371861<//Time><review>I purchased a 2019 F150 XLT FX4 SuperCrew from Fahrney Ford on December 19, 2019; my 15th new Ford since 1984. Between the end-of-year and holiday incentives, the dealer discounts, the ease of submitting an offer for a vehicle in the online inventory, and the near-immediate response by a member of the sales staff, there is no reason not to consider Fahrney Ford if you are looking to add to your rolling stock.

The 165-mile one-way drive was well worth my time and effort, as I got a great deal on just the vehicle I wanted from some truly wonderful people. I cannot offer enough praise and appreciation for the friendly, patient, efficient, and exceedingly professional way Internet Manager Alvaro Aburto saw my deal through from initial phone call to drive-away. Others who offered tremendous help during the process were Brandon Smith and Sales Manager Grant Gurtner.

The Sacramento area is a hub that offers access to many Ford dealers throughout the region, but Fahrney Ford in Selma stands out as one where an exceptional buy can be made in a streamlined manner from a truly remarkable staff in a low-key, enjoyable atmosphere.

I have already referred Fahrney Ford and Internet Manager Alvaro Aburto to a relative and two friends, confident in the fact that they will receive the same outstanding customer service and consideration as have I.

Well done, Fahrney Ford, and thank you, Alvaro Aburto!</review><user_id>112953139839675123162<//user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1577386484032, 'text': "Thank you so much for your awesome review!!

I highly-highly reccomend this place for service or repairs!!!
They treat every customer with such respect and are so polite.
They have a transit for you if you need a ride home.
Theres a starbucks coffee machine in the super clean lobby.
And best of all, they took great care of my vehicle. I'll definitely be going back!!</Text>

<Review>Went in for a recall was told it would be about an hour. After two hours i was told they needed to hook it up to a different computer. Why it took them
Two hours to figure out I’ll never know. Waited an additional hour and a half to get my truck back. They asked me if they could make me an offer on buying my truck from me but never bothered to call me back. My truck was given back to me dirtier then it arrived. TLDR poor communication poor service and didn’t even bother to wash the truck off after keeping it 3 times longer then they said</Review>< date>

<text>I don't know how it is for the rest of this dealership but as far as services it's not good in my opinion. I had a GMC vehicle in for service it took a week and the problem was not fix.  I was charged a little over a grand. The vehicle was not responsive it was lacking preference. I took it to a different mechanic told me and showed me everything that was missed at this dealership it costs me two grand to fix it all and in two days. My vehicle is now running at optimum performance.
Again I whant to let all that read this review this is my own personal experience and I only deld with there service department my experience do not speak for every one. Thanks.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Just got off the phone with Swanson Farney Ford after experiencing multiple issues with my truck. Jacob Whitfield was no help and ended up hanging up on me when HE was done with the conversation. He basically shrugged his shoulders and said we can't help you any further. I would NOT recommend buying or servicing your vehicle at this dealer. ALSO, they have NO transmission tech so hope u don't have any issues with your transmission. Seems like all they are good for is collecting your money and doing oil changes. Hope the owner knows what they are doing and how they handle his business. Guess the next step is to contact the owner....< /review>< pictures>

Took my explorer in for an oil change. Got it done the day and time I wanted and picked it up at the time I needed my car back. Brandon made sure they washed our car and everything. Highly recommend!< /Review>

I have been to many different spots looking for a vechicle that suits my familys needs , From beginning to end this place is awesome, Staff including jonathan carried himself in a professional manner and made sure he answered all questions & gave us proper treatment & not over bearing like most salesman.I would highly recommend if your looking to purchase a vehicle you head down there & ask for jonathan you wont be disappointed.< /review>

On behalf on my mom Yolanda Gutierrez-  "Javier gave us an exceptional experience along with his team in the sales and finance department. I didnt feel pressured, the process felt so easy and smooth. They also provided me with many options, I'm so happy with our brand new GMC SIERRA SLT 2019! 100% will  recommend Fahrney Ford/GMC in Selma!".< /Review>

We bought our car a few months ago from Juan Mendoza, he was very  friendly and great about finding the best car for our family. If they dont have the car your  looking for they will get it for you. The customer service is great and i wouldn't  go anywhere else.  We bought  our car on a rainy day and he was very helpful  making the whole process  go by fast.  I love my new car  we got everything  we were looking  for.. Thank you.</Review>

<Time>1571845399783</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>On Tuesday Sept 17,2019 at approximately 8:00 am. I had an appointment for my 2018 F350 for a cable to my front camera that Ford found was faulty. I initially contacted Fahney in June of 2018 about this issue they ordered the part and set an appointment. (28000 miles on the truck)  I had an family emergency back east and I had to leave the state so I missed my appointment, I returned back to California and contacted Fahrney to have the part replaced . I showed up today at my scheduled time (38241 miles on my truck now) they tell me my truck is out if warranty and it will cost $190. I made the claim well before the 36000 mile warranty was up, they told me it doesn't matter.  Anything for a dollar I guess in between being at the hospital and my sisters funeral I should have taken my truck to a dealer so I was under the mileage. It is my understanding from many friends that work at Ford that if the part is order BEFORE the warranty is up ford will cover it but apparently not Fahney. I know where im NOT buying my next $75000 truck!   Apparently the owner only reaches out and comments on the positive reviews and not the  one's like mine. Seems as a business owner they would reach out and see what they could do. Typical<//review>< Pics>

But I had the worst experience  ever went in to look at a car and I specifically  told the sales people loan manager whatever you want to call them that before I make any decisions  I want to see in paper what I will be paying after the loan is paid off with interest taxes and fees for the 72 months.  Little did I know (first time car buyer) they have already process the loan  for me to take the car without giving me the information I originally wanted first.  The grand total of what will be paid on the car after the contract ends.  $20 thousand dollar car  went up to $40 thousand. For a used car?. When  I told the sales agent that I'm not commiting to this cause that's not what I agreed I specifically  asked multiple times  that i didnt want to commit  to anything until i saw the papers of the final total with a the fees included  and they promise to show me and not once did they bring anything out to show me.  This company just wanted to RIP me off and make a sale off  me I didnt see no discount at all  $20,000 car.  After the 72 month  the grand total was $40,999. I don't know much about cars  but I've spoken to people that buy cars all the time and they never had this bad of experience  or crazy  numbers like this.<//review><resp>{'time': 1576707803721, 'text': "Sorry about the late response Rawbert.

I Despise this place because the customer service is horrible I had to keep calling back for updates about my vehicle and they did not fix my problem. But for another  $5,000 they can fix my vehicle and its issues.
Yeah Whatever. I'm amazed it's still in business.<//Text>

I went there thinking they would help me after my bankruptcy because they said they would. I did what they said I had to do by talking to the finance company and no one called me back even after I called them to speak to someone.  They make you feel like they wanna help, but just run your credit dinging it several times and turn you away.</Review>

This is an update since the original review. We are very disappointed in the service we have received after the date of purchase. From the beginning we were told that we would be receiving a refund for our extended warranty on trade in and we would receive it in 10 days. Well this turned into over a month and multiple calls to the dealer to finally get the money they owed to us. The when we originally purchased the vehicle there was an issue with weather stripping around one of the doors. When I arrived on a later date to have it repaired a comment was made to me by the service writer that this was such a big truck for such a little lady... This was very uncalled for and not professional. Then today we took the truck in for its first oil change, thought we would give you all another try.. Well this was a mistake!!! We told the service writer that there was a rattle in drivers door when hitting bumps in the road and a constant coolant smell coming from engine compartment. They said they could not hear the rattle, yet we heard it just pulling out of the parking lot at dealer when leaving. They said they could not find a coolant leak yet it always smells of antifreeze, and to top it off they left greasy marks all over the hood, drivers side fender, grease with debris on drivers side side step, grease on floor board oil drips all over the plastic cover over radiator and coolant spilled on overflow tank and coolant on the radiator cap. When issue was shown to service writer the mechanic who do the work stated he told someone to "clean that". This is a $73000 truck the mechanic should have been keeping his hands and uniform clean when working on such a vehicle. Another issue we found also was they stated there was a recall for a power steering hose. They had to remove the driver side fender well to inspect and they damaged a clip and didn't replace it. I would like owner to contact me to discuss this!

On May 17th, my husband and I decided to go truck shopping. Jacob and Javier helped us find the truck that we were looking for. They went above and beyond to find our 2019 f250 Lariat and at the payments we wanted. We are very happy. Thank you to Javier for his service to our country and to Jacob who didn't give up on us like Kellers in Hanford did.< /text>

Jose Castor was amazing!  He not only got me a better deal on the car I was looking for, but found one with less mileage, and gave me a popsicle.
The people were friendly and worked with me to fit my budget.
The car is in great shape.
I'm very happy with my experience and would recommend them to my friends and family.< /review>

There are plenty of dealerships around the Valley, but none like Fahrney Ford.  They have a vast inventory to choose from.  Jose Espino really took the time to show me around and let me drive 3 trucks.  Im new to the truck market and Ford has a 2.7L Ecoboost, 3.5L Ecoboost and 5.0L V8 Engines available.  I test drove all 3.  I really liked the 3.5L Ecoboost.  Has just the right specs I need in a truck.</text>

This is a late post but I had to write this review because this place was so amazing! This dealership is absolutely outstanding! I came in with a certain monthly payment that I could not exceed because I have a disabled husband and I am the sole breadwinner. We had a 2014 Camry and my husband couldn't get into any longer due to his injury. I owed about $14,000 on the Camry, but I had to sell it and get an SUV for my husband. There was no haggling, they just walked in and said, "Here is what you wanted!" and I was able to walk away with only $500 down and the keys in my hand for a brand new 2016 Toyota RAV4! Absolutely amazing. I will never go anywhere else. The floor manager, and district manager are so great. We cant thank them enough!< /Review>

Only a 9 because MyKey is annoying when you’re an adult and I had to go see the service staff at Fahrney to help me remove it! Lol.  But Brandon from the service team made my experience super easy and had me in and out in less than an hour with a new key and MyKey removed!  I’d highly recommend visiting the service Dept at Fahrney for all your service needs!</text>< username>

The level of professionalism far surpassed our family expectations!

The team at SFF, Christopher, David and Nico, made sure that we purchased a car that met our growing family needs first and foremost. They gently asked probing questions to get the information, and were extremely patient as we asked car prices and interior space sizes. They then helped us select a car  that our three kids fit in, that my work tools and supplies would be adequately safe and secure in ,  and ultimately that my wife would be  confident that  we were getting the best deal for our money.

It didn't take us long to realize that we were asking for a lot in a car, and this team made this decision a relaxed, educated and perfect experience for the whole family.<//text>

Moua Ly made my experience the best! He absolutely so nice and he wants to help you look what you are looking for. All he wants is for you to be happy and he doesn't pressure you in any way. He will help you in any questions you have and he treats you like you are part of his family. I definitely recommend if you are trying to buy a car go with him first.<//Text>

I turned in my car to get work on the transmission and they said it would be a week until it will be finished. As of right now it’s going on two weeks and they told us that we would “maybe” have it Friday and there was a rental car provided for only five days and I have lost two weeks of work from my job since I am car-less. This time is ridiculous</review>

Very friendly and professional staff, respectful and aggressively reaching out for the customer and encouraging with postive attitudes and family like values. Attentive to my personal request with reassuring words of support that I will be leaving with the vehicle I was looking for. I'll continue to encourage others throughout about this professional experience at FahrneyFord.< /Text>

DO NOT GO TO THEM!!
Would never go back and buy a car there because very bad communication and you do a trade in and they do the payoff late and then they want you to be responsible for the late fees!!! Do not go to them very bad customer service communication and don't know how to clean  there hands for their actions< /Review>

<Text>I was amazed by the bad reviews this dealership has received.  After searching and waiting for a Shelby over a year, I was surprised this dealership was selling one below the sticker price.  Any Mustang enthusiasts would know the thought of purchasing such vehicle at sticker price is slim, let a lone getting one below the MSRP.  I spoke to Alfonso Zamora (Internet Sales Manager), and a day later we made the deal.  Alfonso made the transaction painless as he knew I was driving up from LA to make the deal.  The sale process was smooth and Alfonso ensured my requests were met with the terms I wanted.  I've purchased several vehicles over the years; however, I have never had such a positive experience coming from dealing with car sales reps.  The five star goes to Alfonso and I am going to make an assumption that this is a good dealership as its employees is a direct reflection of its operating procedures.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They had great service and offered me a really great deal when I bought my car from them. I was looking at a used car, but they offered me a brand new car of the same model for the same price and they even threw in a 6-year bumper to bumper warranty for free. Not only that, but they even came to my work and picked up my car to go give it a service and lube from Selma to Kingsburg and brought it back well before I got off work. The service lately has been hit-or-miss though now that I own the car for a few years.</Review>

I assure you, this is NOT the way we do things around here. The salesman/men discussing this were clearly just making a very dumb joke, but that doesn't make it okay. It's impossible to change the mileage on a vehicle. And ALL cars have VIN#'s that are registered so we certainly could not have sold it as brand new if it was in fact used. Again, I assure you, this isn't how we operate. Please give us a call, ask for our general manager Michael Fahrney. He would like to personally speak with you about this to ensure the salesmen in question will be reprimanded for such a thoughtless, ignorant joke."}</resp>

<Text>Just like with most car dealerships, its really hard to tell who is on your team and who isn't. They like to take control of the conversations and make sure you feel stupid for asking questions. I haven't really found an auto dealership that was much different than this, though. If you absolutely have to buy from them, then I guess go ahead, if you don't mind rude and uncooperative staff. My opinion, if you find a car you like here, browse the internet for the same make and model and see if you can find a better deal.<//Text>< user>

My sales person Christpher Arriaga was super!!!!! He was very helpful and knowledgeable! It was my first time making a car deal by myself and his patients and humor put me at ease. He even came all the way out to my house so my husband could sign the needed papers! Very impressed and will continue to be a loyal customer!
Thank you 😀👍🏼<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I would not recommend Fahrney Automotive to an enemy. My experience from the time of purchase has been nothing but a hassle. I have dealt with issues such as the salesman trying to change the terms of my monthly payments and interest on the vehicle days after i had left the lot to having to put my vehicle in the shop twice in the past 9 months.  Of course my salesman sold me the top warranty coverage that in his words "covers almost everything" but actually covers very little. 2 days ago i took my vehicle back to Fahrney for service and was told by none other than the service manager that they would provide me with a rental and then when i arrived the story changed to i would have to wait a few hours for diagnosis before i could receive a rental. The service manager proceeded to tell me we like your business but your more than welcome to go to another dealership. every single employee i have interacted with at this company has told me one thing and done another....Go anywhere but here.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I am so happy we picked Swanson/Fahrney Ford to buy our beautiful 2019 Ford Flex. We look forward to our continued friendship with your staff as we periodically come in to have our vehicle serviced by Swanson/Fahrney Ford.

We will be happy to tell our friends and family about the awesome customer service we received and how Jonathan & Alvaro made our buying experience pleasant and enjoyable. Alvaro was awesome! He put up with my driving. Lol He also was kind enough to sync my phone up with our new vehicle, I really appreciated that very much. 😉 He was very attentive to our questions and concerns, he is a great addition to your team!

Again, many thanks!

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Moua Ly is the salesman we worked with when we bought two cars. He was amazing, no time wasted, no false promises. We never felt pressured and he saw that we were happy with every decision we made. He was up front with everything and we couldn't be happier. When the time comes to purchase another, I don't think we'll go anywhere else or work with anyone else. How often does a person say that about a car salesman or a dealership? Never!! Thank you, Moua and Steven, for all your help and warmth.</Text>< GmapID>

Found a Ford Focus at a good price, went in to see about financing and they found a couple of issues with some other loans.  The finance guy said he didn't want to send it on the weekend because it would automatically be rejected.  He said he was going to send it to a finance company on Monday and call to let us know what he heard back.  The next day we never got a call back.  Monday evening I went to use my credit card and found I left my driver's license at the dealership.  Called them and they said yes they had it.  They had my number, why in the heel wouldn't they call me to let me know they had it.  Very bad customer relations.  We fixed the issues with the loans and will be looking at other dealerships for a vehicle and will let anyone who asks about our experience.</review>

Was completely misled by internet pricing (over 10k more expensive in person). I was told they would beat competitors offers and never got close.

It was nice walking in they were all nice but I figured out they shotguned me every where ! Just to get me approved that messes up your credit pretty bad! I'm still receiving mail from banks that denied me! It's been 1 month since I went in ! Go to future ford of clovis they actually get things done! Purchased my mustang there was fast and easy and they only used one bank.<//text>

I just recently bought my first car here and it was the most amazing car buying experience. Everyone was so friendly from the salesmen to the staff. The salesman that helped me out was Favian Martines, he was so friendly and knowledgable and gave me a great deal. I highly recommend him, he will help you find exactly what your looking for as well as save you money.< /Review>

I took my 2012 mustang to service and they put a used transmission  $3,000 with a warranty of 6,000 miles or 6 months, 2 months later  transmission fluid starts to leak. I take it back 2,000 miles later and they say  the warranty doesn't cover labor estimate $700.  It doesn't  seem fair. If  the warranty covers the parts it should cover the labor. It's not my fault they didn't do the job right.  I can't keep bringing in my car every few months cause they didn't do the job right and keep paying labor. Can anyone there help me?< /Text>

<Review>I wasn't planning on purchasing a new (used) vehicle but it's a woman's prerogative to change their mind.  I contacted Fahrney Auto online, received a call back almost instantly.  I knew what I was looking for so I told Albert, we walked around the lot looking at different vehicles, mainly the vehicle I had mentioned to him.  I did like the cars but knew what I could handle financially so we kept looking.  Albert showed me a Jeep Compass, we took it for a test drive and I loved it.
A couple hours later, I drove away in the perfect car for my needs.

REVISED 7/3/2016
It must have been the excitement of purchasing a vehicle because I forgot almost everything I had been taught about car sales (my Father owned a car lot when I was in my late teens), and the fact I try to believe most people are truthful.
Feel misled, lied to, and now it is costing me more $$

Hoping today was the last of my dealings with this company.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1467911953023, 'text': "Debi, I'm so sorry to hear you are feeling misled, and lied to.

This was my second purchase with Fahrney Group, and they all treated me just like my first visit.... Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  I would like to thank Fabian, Junior and Ameer on helping find the right car for me and the best rate! I will definitely recommend The Fahrney Team to my friends and family.<//review>

<review>I just bought a 2018 camxry xse, and it was an amazing experience! Favian Martines was the salesman that helped us out, very friendly guy as well as the staff too. For being a first time buyer, he was able to give me a great deal and explained everything very clear. I highly recommend him when you go he will help you out with exactly what you are looking for. Great Dealer, thank you guys so much!< /review>< pictures>

We went to Fahrney's not knowing what to expect and to our surprise we received a great experience. Moua Ly was great he was not pushy which made it a easy experience. And they did not make us feel like we were waisting their time, but most importantly is that we didn't feel like we were waisting our time in their lot. We walked out with a 2015 Nissan Altima and my wife and I are happy with our purchase. We would recommend this place to all our family and friends who are in the market for a new car.</Review>

I purchased by vehicle in late December while taking a test drive I heard the breaks squeaking and on occassion a grinding noise. After several visits to the service department the took care of the grinding noise but the squeaking noise is still present. I have made several calls to the service department & I have been told that there is nothing the service department can do without the approval from the managers. I was told by the technician that he left a note for the managers to give me a call but I never received a call & to this day I still haven't received a call. The service department technician did what he could. The managers customer service is what stinks. When you make a call to the dealership & put on hold a statement while on hold is "Customer Service is their number 1 priority", this I find untrue.</Text>

< Review>
I have not purchased a car from Swanson Fahrney, and at this point am not likely to. But my beef is with the service department. My last service, I had a number of routine maintenance items taken care of as well as rear brake replacement.  I am in the habit of taking my own oil in because I have used synthetic oil in my 2007 Rav4 since it was new, and it can be purchased for much less at Costco. They have changed my oil over the years a number of times, and on about 3 occasion the tech has failed to use my oil. This is particularly irritating as I then pay for a lower grade of oil that I do not want, and end up with my own oil sitting there. Yet, I've always returned.
This time my bill was just under $1,300.00. Left the car there for two and a half days. When I pick it up, they have washed the exterior, but done nothing on the interior. Now that's a complimentary service, so it doesn't get done, no big deal. I do rather dislike that the service order says they did it when, in fact, they did not.
Next issue: My oil sits unused. Been there done that.
Next issue: The form where they inspect the car is only partially filled out and very haphazard.  For instance, it would have been nice to know what the state of wear on my front brakes is, but they didn't bother to check it, or, at least didn't bother to put it on the form.  Also, no tire tread figure, nor check of the spare tire inflation pressure.
Then the sticker on the windshield that is supposed to indicate when it is time to return the car for the next oil change, has a mileage which is already passed as the time to return. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. For this I leave the car two and a half days, and pay $1,300.00.
To add insult to injury, there is a note that says if you are not happy with the service, please call the service manager, Mr. Michael Mankin. I called him, and was told he was in a meeting. They took my number and said he would call back.  A week later and no call back. So I call again. I was very polite, not angry and not asking for anything. He said he would check out my issues and get back to me that day. Surprise! No call back.
So, after years of dealing with Swanson-Fahrney, I shall be looking for a new service provider.</Review>

<review>We bought our 2005 Ford F150 here and have been pleased with the truck and continue to go to Swanson-Fahrney for service. I would not take it anywhere else. I live in Lemoore and have a few Ford dealers close by but when the engine light came on the other day I opted to have it towed to Selma. Being a woman it is much harder for us to get a straight answer on what is wrong with the vehicle and a lot of times you pay for much more than what is wrong. I am still all about trust!!! I DO trust Swanson-Fahrney totally, they got the truck in and their people checked it out and I was ready for a transmission as that was one of the lights that came on. They checked out everything and found the problem and I am sure as I have been around awhile (66yrs. old) that I would have had a 90% chance of paying for a new transmission pretty much anywhere else I would have gone!! Arland, I hope I am saying that right was my main man and he was amazing. It now runs like a new truck and I love the service department!!!  What woman wants to get stranded in these temperatures LOL!!! We will be back for our next car or truck for sure. Trustworthy is so much better than closer. Thank you Swanson-Fahrney keep up the good job you are doing in sales and service!!<//review>< Pics>

I recently purchased an Auto April 2013... I was pressured into buying the auto.  Second I got my credit score with my name spelled wrong.  3rdth I was scammed into saying I was given free 3 year extended warranty... later to find out in the signing 1750 later.  4th, I financed 6000 out of a check I had from a car total of 9000. A check was supposed to be give to me for the remainder, but my name was spelled wrong, and Mr. Michael Farney was extremely unprofessional, refused to write a check.  When given the car the tank was half full. His father (the owner should be ashamed to have such a brat for a son).  I would never recommend buying from these people ever again.<//Text>
