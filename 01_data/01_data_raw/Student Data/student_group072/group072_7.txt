<text>I usually give a 5 star for decent service and excellent food, which this place has.  However I was disappointed in the lack of personal interest in the server helping us.  I'm sure it may have been an off day for that person but with times being the way they are and with less traffic flow it would be nice to have someone wanting to be there serving us.  I'll go back and hopefully have a 5 star experience< /text>< rating>

<review>Have been coming to this Pho place since I was in high school. Throughout the yrs my feelings about it have changed on multiple occasions but these past few times this place has been delicious! It has never disappointed by any means, but there were sometimes where broth was less or more flavorful. It's been a lot more consistent lately- broth lately is very delicious and packed w flavor! The staff is very nice, accommodating and swift! I appreciate that about any business and will def keep coming here! Love</review><Resp>None</Resp></record>

<review>If I could give zero stars I would. My father and I came here for lunch after his radiation treatment, he was craving pho so we picked this place because it was close to home. When we got there the place was not packed at all, there were max 5 tables occupied, we sat down and immediately our order was taken, which not bad in my opinion but that's as good as it got. We then were reseated for an unknown reason by the waiter and waited over 30 minutes for our food that never arrived. During this time three more tables were filled and their food brought to them within 10 minutes. We asked the waiter when our food would get to us and his response was you ordered already? We ended up walking out because of the poor service. I understand if orders get forgotten or delayed but to just flat out ignore your customers sitting in the middle of everyone and not ask how they are or if they had ordered yet for over 30 minutes is just wrong and speaks a lot about the care they put into their business. What else do they ignore or forget about I wonder? We will not be coming here again, nor recommend this place to anyone. In fact if you are looking for somewhere to eat I recommend the Mandarin restaurant right next door, 5+ stars for them ;)< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d94e4e24c6514d:0x8fc8a76b127b5abd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of the best places down south to get your fill of delicious pho. My go-to is the spring rolls, #13, and the steak, shrimp, and broken rice combo! You don't have to drive too far from the freeway, which is a nice bonus!< /review>

By far the worst "pho" I've ever had. The broth was tasteless, the noodles weren't pho noodles, vegetables overcooked.  Came with no pho fixings.  It tasted like it had been reheated.

To make matters worse, the staff was rude. We walked in at 8:30 pm (they close at 9) and the server practically rolled his eyes when we asked to place an order takeout because they were "closed".

Terrible service and super horrible taste-wise. Save your money, go somewhere else.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Without a doubt, the worst service I’ve ever gotten at a restaurant. We stood in the cramped doorway waiting to be greeted as multiple servers made eye contact and just kept walking by. Then after we were finally seated, our terrible waitress was unbelievably rude to my girlfriend— like to the point where we just stopped trying to understand what her problem was. She also didn’t bother to write our order down and thus forgot to give me my drink. She never came back after taking our order, not even once, so I couldn’t remind her about my missing drink either. Then when I got the check later from a different server they’d charged me for the drink. When I asked this other server for the drink to be taken off the check, our server insisted that we’d received it and refused to take it off the bill. I had to pay for it. The food was also super basic and not even worth a visit. What a ridiculous, negative experience.<//Text>< Pics>

A funny thing. I live in Alexandria, VA and there's plenty of places for me to get Pho..but, sadly, never had. I have to come to San Diego to have my 1st Pho experience. So glad I did. This place was definitely worth my wait..food was phenomenal. Kind n courteous staff, answered all my questions n explained everything n detail in order I'd have a great experience. Definitely have them saved as a favorite.< /Review>

<Review>Wow. Just wow. A COMPLETE turn around. The very first time about 2 years ago I came here for take out and was less than impressed with the service that I actually left before ordering. About 4 months later I attempted to eat here and was pleased. The food was quite yummy. The service and atmosphere was lacking. But we kept coming bc it was still yummy and I didn't want to travel far. Tonight we came back bc I saw that it looked different from the outside and wanted to check it out. We were there last about 4 months ago. When we came in tonight we were blown away. The atmosphere is fabulous. The new design is so fun, modern and inviting. The service was superb and I swear the food was better than before. Will be back again soon.</Review>< Rate>

In the mood for something fresh and excellent. This quiet little spot is a great place for some of the freshest Pho around. Been coming for years and it is constantly the same every time in a good way. Servers are polite and attend to whatever you need. The food is nicely plated and you can tell they take great care to make each dish delightful.

Already looking forward to the next trip.< /Review>

Waited 30 minutes for a takeout order and I have been to many a Vietnamese restaurants and never have ever had to wait that long even with an extraordinary amount of people. I Ordered spring rolls and they forgot and I had to wait again. The quality of is okay. I live in a Vietnamese community and this is not Vietnamese quality. Probably because it's in a in area where there are no Vietnamese population so the recipes are tailored towards the demographics of the restaurant.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdb5qIdD_CdGW9e-PLqrKY9iexYt2Utom5NUFt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d94e4e24c6514d:0x8fc8a76b127b5abd<//GmapID></record>

The location was nothing special, the food was on the bland side and the prices were high for the quality you received. The saving grace was the portion sizes were massive, so after adding a bunch of sauces to get some flavor, it held our appetites for a while after. We came, we ate and it was just an "okay" experience. Probably wouldn't return.<//review>

Great place for some Pho! Went in today and it was packed not an empty spot but service was top notch and food was delicious as usual ! The gentleman we had a server was very personable and made the lunch super enjoyable for my wife and I. Repeat customers for sure and highly recommend!< /Review>

Their food has good taste.  Portion wise, it's a hit or miss with the noodles and the beef (sometime you get more sometime you get less). The servers have a language barrier, make sure to ask them to repeat your order.
If you are short on time, you can always pay your check at the cashier, instead of waiting for your server to come back. Clean bathroom too.<//Text>

We have enjoyed the fabulous food and delightful service here for more than 8 years.  Love the chicken pho. Love the grilled shrimp and beef. Love the people. When we need a boost we go to Pho Hiep and take our best friends. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<review>It’s not the worst pho I’ve had but it was definitely lacking. The meat was substandard, it was fatty and you could see a lot of the connective tissues. The broth was bland.< /review>< username>

Worst place I’ve ever been to... I rarely put reviews on places i have been to but this one needs to get renovated or atleast get a quality check... ate here about 3x and since the first time it was a bad customer service but i gave them 2nd and third chance but this is the last time i am eating in this place, plates are not clean and while i am eating there are flies and my water has a flies and the server didn’t even ask if everything is okay and is has a very disrespectful attitude... if i can complain somewhere for this place to get close for some inspections i will do so....  for the safety of all the people eating here.
And also to learn some discipline and manner.<//review>

Terrible service.  First I'm waiting to be seated and some other family comes in and and the sever even after me telling her I was here first was about to seat them first. Then that same sever gives my food to the table next to me.  My son and I waiting to eat.  I noticed the two other groups come in after me and they were served first even when we placed our order first.  Finally get our food and the other tables are being asked how is the food and no one asks us. I'm sorry to say this but the family that came in after us and the other table that was given our food were Asian. I'm hoping that had nothing to do with the service that my son and I received.  I'm not sure that my business was welcomed.  Very upset that it was hard for me to enjoy my dinner.<//Text>

<Text>I'm a somewhat regular here because it's near my home, but after today I think I'll make that extra drive somewhere else. Food is ok but family owned business needs to stop hiring rude employees. I was served and never checked on to see if I needed anything else or if everything was ok, instead I recieved a mumbled comment when I did not tip for the non service they provided. Funny thing is the lady wasn't even my server and had the audacity to ask for a tip. Luckily for her I was in great spirits and smiled and said to have a great day.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>While I was eating my soup, I found a long solid black hair weaved into a piece of meat that I was about to eat. It wasn't mine because I have black and blonde hair.

<rate>3</rate><Review>Pho is pretty good, standard issue. Not too salty and not all cloudy like they used a bucket of msg. Real herb and meat flavored broth. Two things I would suggest. I love fatty brisket, but there's is super hard to chew. The fat isn't like fat at all, it's crunchy and hard. It's disappointing when you're expecting something totally different, so I wouldn't order that particular meat. Also, when you get to-go, which I do often, get an extra broth and boil it all at home because the broth they give you just isn't enough and of course it isn't going to be hot enough to soften the noodles by the time you get home!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Service: Service here is truly the only thing that bothers me here. Some of individuals right here appear to care about offering you and some do not. Good or negative service actually depends upon that you get. Food: I come below possibly when a week for either some uncommon beef pho\/seafood pho or the barbequed beef as well as shrimp with rice. I like their food a lot and also I really enjoy their Thai tea with boba (pointer for their boba: if you get a big sized beverage it'll can be found in a to go cup)Auto parking: car park can be a little jam-packed during lunch\/dinner hours. Total: one of my favored locations to get hold of some food to consume just do not expect five star service.< /Review><time>1560468743745< /time><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_id>110048250960536375406</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and drinks to go with but the appetizer never came out, and they still tried to charge us for it. On top of that, the shrimp in my pho hadn't been cleaned properly, and had black streaks running all along the backside of them even though they were fully cooked. When we confronted the manager about it, she got an attitude with us and told us that we should have said something sooner despite us telling our waitress multiple times. Terrible service, they won't be seeing us again.</Text>

Well everything started off great. I was out with my boss and coworker having a business lunch when they brought our food to the table. Immediately I spotted not one but two long hairs intertwined with my noodles. I thought, "You know what, this kind of stuff happens" so I promptly removed the hairs and decided to continue with my lunch. When I was nearing the end of my meal, I felt something thin and hard and I had thought maybe it was the skin of the shrimp or something. When I pulled the unexpected object out of my mouth, to my astonishment, it was a finger nail! Now, I've had a band aid in my food before, so this isn't the worst thing to have happened to me. But who on earth clips their finger nails in the kitchen of a restaurant serving food?? I don't know, but the food was not worth me having to go through that. Terrible.< /Review>

We felt rushed.  Neon lights said "Open" but service said "get out".  It was nearing closing time when we arrived, party of 5.  There are several tables inside to eat.  The restaurant is nicely decorated in asian decor to match the theme of the place.  However, it was difficult to get answers to our questions.  We asked in English and received blank stares.  The food is good, and I love to order take-out.</Text>

< review>
I usually frequent this place as my wife and I enjoy the food.  Tonight I was met with utter rudeness and price gauging.  I ordered a small chicken soup for supposedly $8.50, charged $11.50.  when I inquired... The response was prices went up very rudely, yet the menu stated one price and charged another.  Never coming again.  Just lost a customer for life.  Good luck with the 12 F...ING soup.<//review>

Worst service ever!

First and last time here. I walked in asked to order to go the girl handed me a menu.Once I was ready I walked back to the counter and said i am ready to order ... her response "i am busy right now, wait" I should have left because it wasn't even busy. But I waited, i placed my order and she said it would take about 15 minutes. I noticed a few people waiting to be seated and no one was acknowledging them until one decided to ask to be seated. About 10-15 minutes  later I started noticing the 4 couples that were seated after I had placed my order were already getting their food. I walked over to the counter and spotted my food in a corner table a new waitress asked me if she could assist me I said yes I been waiting for my to go order and she asked for my name went to the kitchen then to the corner table and handed my food. I could not believe my food had been sitting there the whole time, I wonder how much longer I would had been there wait until they decide to call out my name.... I got home and my food was cold had to re heat ... never again!< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>We used to go here all the time.  One of the weekdays, we decided to go early.  We were there at 8:50am.  They didn't open until 9am, so we waited.  9:15 rolled around, they were still cleaning and totally ignored a repeat customer.   We are not begging for food, we were loyal customer driving from Eastlake.  If you can't acknowledge someone who consistently go there,  they probably won't care about the one who never been there.  No more going to this place ever.<//Review>< Pictures>

The Pho here was good. The Pho here was hot.
I imagine it's prepared in a big silver pot.
I got it with brisket, and rare strips of flank,
I poured in some fish oil and then my fingers stank.
I recommend it with hoisin, with basil and sprouts.
For the spicy connoisseur--Sriracha no doubt.
Remember to wash your hands when your meal here is through.
Because the odorous fish oil will leave your fingers as fresh as fish poo.< /review>

They were terrible servers. The food which was gross came out quickly. The food being bad would have been ok if the servers were good but once we received our food they stood about ten feet away staring at us eat. Not only did they watch us but when I asked for more chili oil they told me  I didn't need it. We were so uncomfortable we left. If you want a good pho place go to the one off the 5 on Saturn.< /Review>

< Review>
Our party of 5 walked into the front door, we are the only people awaiting a host to be seated. There are 2 large tables ready, yet after 8 minutes go by and countless waiters walk by us and one of us have to walk up to the manager and ask why we haven't been greated. The manager then makes up excuses that do not make sense. - extremely poor service, full excuses and a  clueless staff.</Review>

<text>They used to be 4 stars.  A decent pho joint near our home.  However they recently raised their prices.  A large bowl of pho should not cost nearly $11!  That's absurd.  Also they did something to their beef slices.  They tasted like they were cooked before being put in the hot broth and the beef was dry and falling apart.  There are far better pho places in downtown Chula Vista.  I won't be going here anymore.<//text>< Pics>

Staff is good but they do get busy, usually during a raining day. Also good for hangovers...especially when you have it with a Tiger beer.
Its not expensive. Would definitely recommend this place.< /Text><resp>None</resp>< rating>

I have been coming here (including eastlake location) for 6 years and I have never been disappointed with their service. Their waiters are very efficient and kind, and their pho is incredible. My boyfriend and I have become regulars these past few months and we come by at least once a week now. I've tried many other pho restaurants but there is no comparison- theirs is by far my favorite. We absolutely love coming here and thank you for always remembering our order, two large #8 and two jasmine iced teas with sugar!</Text>

When we finally order, after 10 minutes they said they dont have the food order so I ask what is available on the menu cook so we did order again. They came back after few minutes saying the kitchen is already close that was 30 minute prior to closing @ 930 pm. What a waste of time! Very disappointed and will not eat on this restaurant again!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is the better option for pho if you're down south. The usual #1 is my pick but my buddies like the rice combo dishes.

Otherwise, stop by Pho Hoa.< /Review>< Rating>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Love, love, love this place. Very clean and authentic! The Pho is full of flavor, like when gramma cooks and adds that touch of love. Ive gone to MANY pho spots but this one is definitely one of my favorites. Super friendly staff and are always prompt in bringing your food. But please guys, stop being so stingy with the limes, all pho places do this, why? Hahaha< /Text><date>1463973979164</date></record></dataset><record>

Got there, not really busy. It started good, Gave us a table in 2 min. Ordered spring rolls as apetizers, 3 phos and a dinner plate for my son. Received pho first, 15-20 mins after, we get dinner plate. Waiter apologized but still late. We had to ask for the spring rolls which came in shortly after dinner plate. Low quality tripe(really really hard) can't knock on waiter due to his age and lack of enthusiasm. I've been to many places and by far this takes the price for worst one. Slightly over priced. Flavor was ok. Felt like going to Taco Bell for authentic Mexican food. Kearny Mesa has a couple of great places for pho, I just tried to keep my business locally.<//Text>

Horrible,  I will never come back here. They don't even speak English.  You cant ask them a question,  and if you do ask a question  they look at you like a deer in headlights. The short cubby, black hair ,front girl is very rude.< /review>

Owners scamming prices. e order plenty of food, they charged us $0.50 to $0.70 over than what is stated on the menu. I asked why, owner stated it is too expensive to reprint the menu and since it is stated in small print "prices are subject to change without notice", she said she can charge whatever she wants. Strange, I thought it is actually very defined market and statements such as this have a name "false advertisement> It is up to people to go there or not, but I think everyone should know before ordering.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Delicious and traditional Vietnamese food!
Spring rolls are healthy and light. The sauce accompanied with corn powder is perfect.
The amount of the dish is pretty! I will eat again!

Love their chicken shawarma, it's so flavorful but messy! Service is good, they're very friendly! The chicken biryani was really good too! The butter chicken has a bit of a tomato tartness to it, but still a good dish.<//text>

<text>The value is incredible for Indian food. I can spend anywhere from $15-20 on Indian food, but here I could feed my entire family for $30. It primarily focuses on the southern provinance cusisine-so there isn't a lot of options in the way chutneys. They're honest about which good is fresh which I can appreciate and I do like that the meat is on the bone for authenticity. The food is accurate in appearance to pictures, it's spiced really well, portions are fantastic, and the service was incredible. I got chicken Biryani, Aloo Gobhi, Gajar Hales, and Garlic Naan. My favorite was the Aloo Gobhi-the blend of flavors was just right.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Date>1613786692950</Date><Text>The shawarma is perfect! The lamb is succulent and perfectly cooked. The spices are deep and smoky and the medium is exactly as spicy as I anticipated a medium being. The veggie shawarma is filled with delicious potato, tofu and veggies. The naan is a tender and delicious. Great customer service and prices that can't be beat.<//Text><UserId.>117029611359881190096< /UserId.><Name>Sarah Russell</Name><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

<review>This is one of my new favorite places! The food is not only amazing but I feel so welcomed every time I come to pick up my order (have only done take out so far). The ladies are always so warm and friendly whenever I come in and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious Indian food. This location has a hard time retaining restaurants and I really want this one to stay for the long haul!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My first time ever trying Indian food at an actual Indian run restaurant and I was not disappointed. I had the number 12, Chicken Karahi (mild) with garlic naan and it was SUPER FIRE!!! I will definitely be coming back to try more menu items!< /text>

<text>We've been ordering out for weeks due to a kitchen remodel gone wrong. I'd heard about this hole-in-the-wall place and so we tried it. One bite, and I almost started to cry. This isn't fast food, it's not even restaurant food - it's home made with love and it will make you feel like everything is going to be okay now. Ordering from them every week from now on... even when the kitchen is finished, probably.< /text>< pictures>

DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE ORDERING! I ordered through the website for a pickup and they never received the order but my money was taken on the website. They were still able to take my order and the food was amazing.< /Review>

** update** over a period of time quality of food n taste went out of the window. Than eventually the customer service got sarcastic. I stopped coming here. I work hard , and I want to satisfy a good appetite, but no, the price went up from $6.99 to $8.99 . Eventually I was letting them charge me at will for 2 dinners. Sometimes up to $36 bucks.  I can feed myself elsewhere if I wanted to save money. But these old ladies are cheats. Sorry, I'm very heart broken.< /review>

What a treat. As soon as I opened the bag I knew I was in for some good food. The smell was intoxicating and the taste even better. I highly recommend this place. The owner is very nice. I look forward to my next meal here when I come back to West Sacramento. I recommend spicy level 1 or low as even with that level it is still very flavorful.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x809ad43967bdcead:0x381f14d69aed06a9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Very friendly people. I was visiting CA and I was couple miles away from this restaurant, plus I didn’t have a car. Even though they don’t do delivery, when I explained them my situation, they were happy to deliver to me. Definitely recommend anyone who want good food to support these kind of local, family owned places. Good job guys</review>< pictures>

Nice place to relax, people watch, eat good, etc.  The staff was friendly and sociable. It has a good feel to it. I can see why they have so many great reviews.<//Text>

Nice place. Friendly staff. The food is good as long as you are comfortable with spicy food. Just one thing that they don’t have menu for children though. Good for adults.< /Text>

Absolutely no taste, and will never recommend anyone to this place. Second time I been there, bad food both times! No wonder restaurant is always empty, never seen  people dining there both times! I got sick when I came home, throwing up over and over!  Definitely need a food inspector to check what there doing back in the kitchen. Never will I go back. Absolutely horrible!!!!!!</review>< time>

<review>Wow!  Driving through Sac and needed something in a hurry. It was 2 PM on Saturday and the lunch buffet was still out, which can be tricky in some places as the food may have been out for a while.  Not in this case - it was perfectly fresh.  And lots of choices for vegetarians as well. Absolutely amazing flavors!  And the service was excellent. Wished we lived closer, we would go there all the time!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809ad43967bdcead:0x381f14d69aed06a9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I stopped at this place for the first time and boom!! It was the greatest indian Pakistani food. The chicken tikka masala was so delicious and quantity of food is good for the price. The place is super clean with a very good customer service. Definitely going back again. Highly recommend this place.<//Text>

The garlic naan bread is excellent. The food can be gotten without hot spices. The restaurant is operated by a family and we got to meet everyone.  It's under new ownership now. The food is better and they offer delivery too. Much improved</Text>

We happened to know about the owner through Shan Market who have a very positive feedback about the Curry Paradise owner, Mr. Hafeez. Therefore we went today to he restaurant and were equally impressed by the hospitality, the quality of food and the cooking. The Kebabs and chicken karahi were very tasty, but the goat biryani stood out to be the best. Definitely will look to visit them again!!!<//Review>

<Review>Second visit to Curry Paradise and once again the food was fantastic.
In addition to the great food...we felt as if we had been invited to
a family home where the food and hospitality was all about
making sure we were happy guests.  We asked lots of questions and the waiter who I believe was the owner, was delighted by our questions and happy to answer.
The cafe atmosphere
that some reviews complain about is part of the charm.  It is like eating in the family kitchen instead of a big fancy ornate dining room. They focus
on what is most important ... for me it is the quality of the food and the warm and friendly service.  I highly recommend this place if those are important to you. Warning, this flavors and spices are so perfectly balanced and delicious, it can be addicting...I am already thinking about
how I can get over to the lunch buffet during the day after my two great dinner experiences.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<review>We were on the hunt for a quick bite on our way to Sierra Hot Springs in Sierraville north of Tahoe. As expected we got caught in early afternoon Bay Area traffic, and needed a bite for early dinner.

We had heard of hole in the wall Indian restaurants in the Sacramento region. And good ole Yelp lead the way to Curry Paradise, a Pakistani restaurant (similar to North Indian cuisine). Google reviews confirmed this place is legit.

This restaurant is set beside a subway and gas station and has ample parking outside.

The owner from Lahore in Pakistan was super friendly and guided us on our menu selection. While the buffet was a great deal at $9.99, we wanted something custom made.

The owner recommended chicken kebab (yes they are know for their kebabs) for my wife. She taught that was some of the best chicken kebab - and this isn't some white girl who doesn't know her Indian, but a white girl married to an Indian, who knows his Indian. She gave it five stars. Although the owner recommended beef or goat kebab, which he claimed are even better.

We also ordered a plate of Pakoras (veggie fritters dipped in chickpea batter), which were excellent. Not too oily, crisp and with the right amount of spice.

For my main, I wanted their best cottage cheese (paneer) entree. The owner recommended two - saag paneer and paneer tikka masala. I opted for the latter with garlic naan. He made is extra spicy per my request. Delicious. The quantity was enough to become a leftover meal for another day.

The owners wife popped out from behind the kitchen and my wife asked about chai. She said don't have the chai by the buffet, and she would make a fresh pot. She asked me if she should make white girl chai (easy on the masala) and I said give it a desi twist, as my wife can handle more spices than I can. As it turns out, the chai was delicious. And I know my chai. My wife felt this was better than 90% of the chai's she's had in her trips to India. I concur. It was milky, spicy. Tip: Ask for desi masala chai at Indian restaurants to avoid getting plain chai that has minimal masala (spices).

The owners were awesome and said they had recently taken over the restaurant and revamped the menu. They are proud of their home cooked style and specialize in kebabs. In fact they were scrambling to fill an order for 150 plates of kebab for an event, but they spent enough time chatting with us and making us feel welcome.

I would visit them again for their delicious food, warm hospitality and great prices (decent quantity too).

Be a neighborhood hero, supplier your local small business owners.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The best most authentic Indian food in town
I've tried them all and this is my favorite, always flavorful and with a good variety in the buffet. This place has both South and North Indian recipes, unlike most of the others around which are mostly North/Punjabi.< /review>

We were the only ones there. Very bad service, the server/owner seemed to be in a terrible mood. Samosas were too light on fillings but otherwise good. However the sauces were not, we were offered a "sweet" sauce that was practically water and another sauce that can only be described as tartar sauce...yes that's right, tartar sauce with samosas. Ordered butter chicken and the dish had way too much cardamom. Sauce tasted like tomato soup with cinnamon and cardamom. Garlic naan wasn't bad tasting although a little burnt and lacked the fluffiness that makes naan...well naan. Naan was more like roti. All in all a very disappointing experience especially given the past reviews.</review>

Horrible Lamb biryani.
This is the second time we order from this place, last time I also order 1/2 tray biryani and end up waiting cuz it was too salty, neither my guests or us couldn't eat it. We did complain to the management and told them since it's a new management we will give one more chance.
When I place the order today the special instructions was less salt and mild spice. Make it story short my daughter or myself couldn't eat.. It is salty and very very spicy and oily too. My husband try to eat with a lot of yogurt.  I know every one make mistakes but what cannot tolerate is that the way manager handle the situation. Very bad.< /Text>

<text>I used to love this place and I'm very sad to see it has gone downhill. The service here was no good and the food was extremely disappointing.

When we first got there, I took a really long time before any staff members noticed us and came or of the kitchen.

We ordered garlic naan, chicken korma, and mango chicken.

Less than half of the pieces of the garlic naan order were actually garlic naan. My fiancé said it looks like the naan that Costco sells. I definitely agree that it did not taste like fresh made naan. Not being served all garlic naan when ordering garlic naan was also very frustrating.

The chicken korma was very watered down and the sauce didn't taste like much.

The mango chicken was way too sweet! It tasted like the mango salsa that sams club sells, which in my opinion is too sweet for a main course dish!

I was very disappointed and won't be coming back!</text>< Pics>

Maybe they closed forever but they open just few months ago.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Some of the best Indian food I've ever had! The location (sharing a building with a gas station but completely separate enterances)  makes you think twice, but I decided to try it out of convenience. 100% not disappointed. I had the samosas, garlic naan and chicken tikka masala.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Food - 2/10 (Neither Fresh Nor Tasty) , Ambience - 5/10 ( Just OK ) , Service - 2/10 ( I believe waiter is the Owner - He was just in his own world ), Price - $10 Buffet (Items are limited though) . I'd rather spend a little more and eat something fulfilling rather than burning $10 for nothing.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Order to go items like Biryani or Fried rice are OK.
Buffett is little expensive and the the dining hall is always hot.</Text>

I recently order nachos with no cheese and no sour cream. After purchasing and checking my order I noticed they put cheese on them... That wasn't the real issue, the real issue was once I returned the nachos they wanted me to purchase another at full price. It wasn't until they admitted that it was their mistake that they would give me a free replacement. I left their nachos and got my money returned.<//Text>

Friendly service. Great portions. The BBQ chicken super burrito is my favorite in the area! Great selection of meats to fill or top all your favorite dishes. Counter staff is always friendly and welcoming. Food comes out quickly and is always consistent. I like food far more than the Mexican restaurant across the street on the Safeway side!</review>

<text>First of all let me say I loved the Chips and Salsa.  Chip super thin like I like and the Salsa not so warm or hot that it kills the actual flavor.
My Vegi Taco's tasted boring until I squeezed the lime on them.  Yum.
My friend was not as impressed with her Fish Taco's.  Pricing was comparable to other similar restaurants in Santa Rosa.
Having said that, probably wont be back as I felt as if I was eating in yuck.  Every surface from the seating to the tables, table legs, etc, that I touched was sticky.  When I stood up to leave my jeans stuck to the bench.  I also sat directly under the TV, it was loud enough, but because of the overall noise in the room I could not clearly hear the show.  Overall Food, Okay, Ambiance, Sticky and noisy. Pricing Okay.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I've lived around the corner from this restaurant for approx 10 years and only within the past couple have I been coming here. I wish I had found them sooner! Their food is always fresh, made quickly and delicious! They have great taco Tuesdays, which they are busy but you still get your order quickly. They don't skimp on the ingredients, nice portions for the price. Their salsa is some of my favorite and always wish I had more! The staff is also very nice and always have buy smiles on their faces. The inside of the restaurant is nice too, I love the Loteria cards they have up as decorations by the door. Do yourself a favor and check out this hidden gem!<//text>< Name>

<Review>Best Mexican food in Rincon and Bennett Valley. Far better than Los Tres Chiles across the street. If you're reading this just hurry up and place your order.
I recommend the Lengua. And everything else. Have a Modelo or Jarritos with your meal. Because... why not?
1$ tacos on tuesday.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>We hired Tacqueria Los Altos de Jalisco to provide a taco cratering service for a rather large housewarming party. They showed up days before the party to plan out where they would stage their equipment. They showed up on time, fed some hungry guests, then packed up and left without any issue. I will 100% call this establishment again for any future catering service, and I recommend them to everyone.<//text><user_name>Adam Kuzmicki<//user_name><gmap_id>0x808448f6cddca2b5:0xac2e33dc4c67f5d3< /gmap_id><user_id>100174751190826001265< /user_id>< Pics>

The food was just ok, not very flavorful at all. The kids bean and cheese burrito was so loosely wrapped it fell apart within minutes.

The chips aren't bad, a little thin for my taste but they did the job. The salsa that came with the chips was very bland. Barely any spice, and more reminiscent of ground tomatoes in water.

The service was good and the people are nice.

In the end, I don't plant to go back.< /Review>

Always delicious, one of very few places I can trust to make beef tounge.  Come back a couple time to sample the menu and you don't even notice that you have become a regular. Glad I found this spot. Especially on taco Tuesday.< /text>

<review>This family owned business has exactly the type of home style cooking you are looking for when hungry for some Mexican style cuisine. Fresh ingredients, hot plates, and cold beers ranging from Corona to IPA. If you want Mexican food hassle free, don't waste any more time and head over to Los Altos De Jalisco or call and pick up your order for those that are short on time, but not on appetite.< /review>< Time>

We have been doing our Taco Tuesday promotion for almost 4 years, which starts at 12 noon. We cannot sell the tacos before 12 o'clock because it would be unfair to do so for other customers. Our cashiers know that this is not allowed, so we have notices at the entrance for our clients to see the schedule. Excuse me for the uncomfortable hopefully and get our point. Thank you.\n\n(Original)\nBuenas Tardes, Disculpa por la molestia que haiga tenido en nuestro restaurante. Nosotros tenemos casi 4 años haciendo nuestra promocion de Taco Tuesday, que empiesa a las 12 del dia. Nosotros no podemos vender los tacos antes de las 12 porque seria injusto hacerlo por los demas clientes.

This is my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. It is so good. It is the best Malatang I've had in the U.S. and you can choose from a lot of fresh and delicious ingredients. This place is a special treat!</Review>

Very nice and hip interior design and decorations. The seatings look great although at the curved booths, our party of 4 found it uncomfortable to sit, being squeezed in and awkward feeling.

The food selection is good although pricy. That being said, they have very creative presentations of dishes, using ceramic figures that blow steam. Great for IG pics.

And the service for 90% of the staff is very attentive and kind. I only docked 1 star because one of the staff got my order wrong and indignantly insisted it wasn't.

Overall a great place for friends and hanging out over good food.<//review>

To be honest, the food is not bad but it's not great either. Just above average if you ask me. However, the prices are too high for what I'm getting. It's probably cool to try it out if you haven't been and check out their offerings. I know I won't be going back because I feel everything is overpriced. Now if the prices are more reasonable, it's a different story.<//Review>

Not fresh. Not taste good. The sauce is definitely not Malaban — as I’ve tried all different kinds of authentic Malaban 抚顺，丹东，沈阳，etc. The duck products we ordered was sooooo dry and hard to chew. Three people, three bowl of Malatang, one plate of duck products, $80. Yep. My friend also said she got diarrhea after.< /Review>

<Review>Tasty but not worth the price and the waiting time. Malatang is nearly $13 per pound. Waiting time is terrible. A party of 2 arrived at 6pm Sunday night. Had to wait for about one and a half hour to get seated.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

A lot of food choices for malatang. Their Guobaorou is the best I've had in the bay area. I don't give 5 stars because the price is really expensive. I hope they either adjust the price or don't take the weight of the plate into consideration when weighing the food.<//text>

There are other dishes available
The bottom of the incense pot is charged, and it is a little expensive, but it tastes good.
In addition, it is recommended to taste the sauce in the sauce table, spicy, noodles, ah, delicious.

自選，菜蔬肉肥，麻辣燙，香鍋和麻辣拌三種口味
還有其他菜品可選
香鍋底料收費，總體有點小貴，但味道不錯。
另外，推薦醬料台的調味肉醬，香辣，拌麵，嗯，好吃的啊<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQhXBMg1qhMvC5BE0-hT1GAqtQs3fyftBYKT-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-YmcN0HSKfNFtAN_a-2QgiV9XpdAzVm9CVpCS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8f8-M5x7KoSLGW80-26I0gO9CLgpO3BPqkcZ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8jer7EWi8sBolIgWx9UtVHmAsqWnOEnls5Yo6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

But the first feeling was not very good. After sitting for about 10 minutes, someone came to pay attention to us. The attitude was not good. Waiting for the water waited for another 5 minutes, and the table was a little sticky. I ordered a few snacks and spicy food. The taste is very general, and it is expensive, and the price is too low! I should not go to the second time again.

早幾天來這吃晚飯，想説試試新餐廳。可是第一感覺就不太好，坐下差不多10分鐘才有人過來理我們，態度又不好，等水又等了5分鐘，而且桌子還有點黏黏的。點了幾個小吃加麻辣燙，味道很一般，而且還貴，性價比也太低了吧！應該不會再去第二次了</text><Date>1573021475765</Date>< rate>

I get diesel fuel here in the morning and sometimes grab something from the mini mart. Its well lit, clean and fully stocked with all you might need. Friendly sales staff. I don't know what else you would expect from a gas station, it is a well run business making every effort to keep the customers coming back.< /Text>

<Review>Pull into the store on March 15th 2020 and signs are posted that I must have a mask to enter the store. I have a mask so I enter the store and the employee is not wearing her mask. She has it but she says she doesn't want to wear it. The employees at this store are putting the public health and safety at risk the time is 1:06 p.m.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2711867ef74f:0xe58d99ff273b720f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love this place because they always have my favorite soda in stock, and I can't find it in most places even the big box stores. Very friendly and clean as well.</Text>

The drive through speaker has not worked in years.. fix that!!
Also, WE CAN TELL WHEN YOU REUSE THE OIL!!
The chicken was crispy but the flavor was COMPLETELY off, it’s taste like grease fire.

Not cool !!</Text>

<Review>I ordered a five piece combo and they gave me a 12 piece and then argued with me saying that's what I ordered.  They fixed my order but gave me a drink that leaked all over my car, no straw and the tiniest biscuit I've ever seen. They also forgot the apple pie.  The worst part of it all is it just didn't taste right. There was too much pepper in the gravy and it was runny.

I was surprised that they made my food as I ordered it so it was hot and tasty!!! The employees were super nice. Maybe they made to order because it wasn't busy or later in the evening.  Either way I was very happy!!!!<//Text>

The chicken was okay if you like fat meat and greasy, always have to pull off some  chicken skin. Fried okra is delicious, but they always give me the smallest jalapenos it takes three to equal one regular size jalapeno.< /text>

Last week they gave my order to someone else.  It was brought back into the store and they handed it me.  It was missing mashed potatoes, and had a chicken strip with a bite taken out of it from the previous customer.  This week the guy at the counter give me an attitude when I told him last week was BS, and I get 3 old Mac n cheese instead of a large in my family meal.  They also screw you on jalapeno poppers.  Avoid this place.< /Review>

Although the workers were young they were just a little to playful with each other. They handled me with courtesy and in a timely manner and the chicken and corn on the cobb was great.
Dinning are very clean for 2pm in the afternoon</text>

The other stores have closed in the area. 3 in a matter of months; Berkeley, CA, Oakland, CA and Richmond, CA. I gave it four stars for surviving and I can't always go to El Cerrito, CA to get my fix. I'd be more thadan a good regular customer if they'll open a few more stores closer to home.
There will be no more stores in this area when this store closes. Then we'll have to go to Popeye's.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>102945538098039436970< /UserId.><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80857851b0e45d77:0xfb3a73c52a5be6ce< /Gmap_id>< date>

I don't know what day is a good day to go to this place, but the only reason I come back is because I love the damn chicken!  The service is so so and it's a toss up on when you get fresh chicken.  Someone please let me know about fresh chicken days and times!< /text>

They had good service and asked me everything about my order. They made me feel confident in my order. Only actual complaint is imo the chicken can be a little too greasy.< /text>

Came to visit church’s chicken two hours before closing @7:45p (closing time 10:00p) Lobby full of people waiting to order, staff is stating they’re not cooking any more chicken for the day.
If you have two hours before closing time and a parking lot/lobby full of people wouldn’t you think you fry some more chicken!<//Text>

Always a super long wait to order and get food. And  the deals that are advertised aren’t always available at this location. Staff sometimes are in a good mood others times not so much. The location is the best part.</text>

Its a wild roll of the dice for service, just make sure to check your order when you get it.
Expect shenanigans and headaches.

Me & the wife went on a Saturday in the middle of the day - LOBBY WAS LOCKED & CLOSED. They were ONLY serving customers in the drive though. I NEVER use drive throughs because the odds of them screwing up your order are about 99.9%. Plus, I had a coupon and that just confuses these people even more after they initially ring you up at a higher price. We left empty handed and drove down the street to Popeye's. We got the first 8 pieces of a fresh batch of chicken. We ate there in the restaurant; which BTW was fairly busy with several tables occupied. Hot, Fresh, Delicious. Churches dropped the ball. Popeye picked it up.<//Text>

I wish I could give it 0 stars. Drive through mic has not been fixed for at least a month and people are just plain rude. Avoid this place at all cost. Same goes for the popeyes nearby where workers are worse.</text>

They didn't have ice, bathrooms were locked, employees were very loud, and there was a leak from the rain next to the window. Overall sub-par.< /Review>

Very greasy chicken! It wouldn't have been half bad if the chicken wasn't so greasy! The biscuits were passable although they were a bit dry. The corn was quite bland. Can't say I'd buy their food again.<//Review>

I have had no problems at this joint. Food is always fresh and hot. The biscuits are um, um gooooood! And it is what it is with the wait. But the chicken is so good its worth the wait to me and my family!</Review>

< Review>
I backed out the *drive thru* line because it wasn't moving, only to find that online the inside was flooded out, so  you had to order in drive thru!🤯 therefore, losing my original place in line, then the ordering speaker was out of order, so it really was a longg wait, hot food though, but the chicken strips was burnt!!! and the honey biscuit was too!!! So not worth the longg wait/inconvenience...</Review>

Gave up in the drive through.  I think they start with a live chicken each time someone orders.  Was waiting for over 10min and not a single car was served.  Poor chickens.< /text>

Right before arriving at Playland-Not-At-The-Beach, my husband had a sudden craving for chicken that he HAD to satisfy. Weird.

There were 3 of us in the car and none had ever been to a Church's before. The drive-thru was like any other, but the menu was new to me! I wasn't at all hungry but I had to try SOMETHING! So I tried the Cajun rice (side) and one piece of crispy chicken. Husband had a chicken sandwich with fries and a drink. Food came pretty quick and I asked for hot sauce, but it was already in the bag. Sweet. Wish I had a couple extra packets. It was pretty good stuff!  My piece of chicken was crunchy and good. I liked the crispy breading but it was a little greasy for me after a few bites. Good flavor though. I don't know how to explain the cajun rice. It was like a mash of rice and meat. We all agreed there was meat in the rice. It's probably my fault for not knowing that cajun rice has meat, but I didn't want unidentifiable meat (or any meat for that matter) in my rice so I tossed this.

Husband's sandwich lasted about as long as my rice. He took a few bites and then took a look inside. The patty just looked really unappetizing. It was a grey-ish color in the middle and something just wasn't right.  His fries ended up in my lap at this point as he tried to wash away all the bad with his giant soda. I decided to abandon my piece of chicken after viewing his. I'd return here, but only for the hot sauce.< /Text>

They were closed at 8pm even though the sign says 9pm closing.  The drive-through line was still open, but the wait was so ridiculous I left after 20 minutes of waiting.  I never got my chicken.</review>

(Translated by Google) The super bad service, there was no ice for the sodas, the pure was broken, the tables were dirty, the bathrooms were dirty, there was a bad smell. only the chicken tasted good. I definitely NOO recommend it.

I like eating there, but the portion keeps getting reduced and the price going up, i paid 14,49 for chicken, rice and a bit of salad. I can get double the amount of food for 10,99 at flame broiler...<//Review>

I asked if the chicken is darkened on the shish kabob, was told it isn't,  it was actually more burnt than other restaurants. Cashier / order taker should have known or asked. Not a big deal but I think 4 or 5 stars should be excellent.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b4d5296efe63:0xc18816c383853b74< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>So disappointing. I had a good day till a decided to come here. Came in to grab dinner to go. Ordered a salad and wrap. The place was empty with the exception of the 6 employees. 10 minutes later they came to confirm my order, they had obviously forgotten about me. Long story short, it took 20 minutes for a salad and wrap when the place was empty. When I asked if that was normal, they just said "sorry, we're training a new chef." The food was uninspiring. The chicken in my wrap was dry, I've had better from a chicken wrap at a gas station. Paid extra to add chicken to a salad and had to search to find 2 little pieces. Not worth the wait. Not coming back. Don't make the mistake of coming here.<//text></record>

My favorite restaurant. Their garlic sauce is extremely addicting, so I order 12 oz of it on the side. Once you eat here, then you'd understand.</Text>

I can't stand getting charged for sauce on the side. If I'm paying for a whole family meal to go how are they going to charge almost $2 for an ounce or less of sauce. Ridiculous< /text>

We tried the giro meat garlic fries and they left a nasty garlic taste in our mouth. The fries where sitting in a bunch of minced garlic. This was the only thing we tried.</text>

I got something called Mediterranean nachos (inretrospect, maybe that's my fault) they were TERRIBLE!! And I got some falafel patties, THEY were TERRIBLE! And I got a Gyro sandwich which was tasteless. All in all, one of my least favorite food experiences in Torrance so far. Oh, even the Lemonade was bad. LEMONADE!!!< /Review>

I was giving a talk nearby at the Kaiser center and stopped here for lunch. So glad I did. This location is small and so is the parking lot. We barely found parking and due to the lunch hour rush, the line was long but moved quickly.

The menu isn't very extensive. I had the chicken caesar wrap with garlic fries. My wrap was wonderfully fresh and seasoned and the dijon mustard added a great spicy kick.

Sadly there aren't too many locations in SoCal but I could definitely eat here regularly. It stands apart from most fast food places.</Review>

<Text>it was pretty alright. i got the 1/4 chicken with rice and falafel. the rice and chicken were tasty, most of the garlic sauce met the inside of my tummy. the falafel was another story.

you should learn something new every day. tonight i learned that falafel tastes like butt. maybe it only tastes like but at this place, but how someone put those spices together and decided "yeah. that's the stuff right there" i'll never know. that stuff did not stay in my mouth for long, and i think i can still taste it after having finished my meal. i shan't be getting falafel here again, and possibly anywhere.

that said, i would otherwise order food here again. my only other source of contention is that it took an hour to get the food here. had i not been pregnant, hungry, and uncomfy, i would have walked since it's really not that far. it's a block and a light away. but i am lieutenant waddlesworth and i go nowhere that isn't led by a toddler.

oh yeah. i also got the avocado wontons. they need a little something else. i'm not sure what, but there's not much to them. it really does seem to be almost all avocado.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Half chicken meal for white meat is only 1 breast.  That's not half chicken.  Overpriced the chicken breast was very dry.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) LA goes to Los Angeles to PR the detoxification effect of Yaeyama Chlorella all over the world.

Move to Santa Monica in preparation for work from Monday. I am hungry, I go to a nearby restaurant without looking for a shop.

Something stuck in a salad, rice, chicken, came on. It is unknown whether Japanese people talk or not, but it is a complete meal.
The soup is delicious.

八重山クロレラのデトックス効果を世界中にPRすべく米国ロサンゼルス入り。

月曜日からの仕事に備え、サンタモニカに移動。お腹が空き過ぎて、お店を探すことなく近くのレストランへIN。

サラダ、ライス、チキン、に包む何かがついてきた。日本人の口にあうかどうかは不明だが完食。
スープは美味しいです。<//Text>< pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><review>(Translated by Google) The roasted chicken is this juice, the salads are prepared at the moment, parking with access to a wheelchair and easy to see from the street the cooks treat you well.

Had a minor issue with biscuits. But the manager didn't waste our time. She just offered a different option. Quick and efficient service.</review>

The service was so quick and convenient. Leonard was clear and helpful making the drive thru one of my best experiences at a fast food restaurant. Food was delicious as well as being fresh and hot.</text>

At this location currently. The lobby looks clean, but we waited over 5 minutes for a famous bowl. When my order was finally ready the girl behind the counter yelled "HERE!" And went back to vulgar conversation with her co-workers. They were playing with some electronic. Not welcoming at all. Poor service and disrespectful employees.<//text>

This place was disgusting. No drink tops and a lot of crud in the area where they go. The counters were all covered in clutter and dirty. The staff was completely not give a damn. Spoke to me like it was a chore to take my money and get me food. Will not return ever. I don't have high expectations for fast food but this was truly bad.< /review>

<Text>Employees are disrespectful. Always yelling loudly and cursing even when children are around. Throwing food on the counter when it’s ready like we did a horrible thing ordering food. I get that it’s a fast food joint but there should at least be common courtesy to act somewhat mature when customers are eating in the store.</Text><name>Tyler Russo< /name><Rate>1<//Rate>< time>

They have an employee problem.

If you make the mistake of saying you are reading the menu, you will need to wait a long time until they think you have been punished enough.

Good ol' KFC but running the gauntlet of the employees rath will keep them in the break room longer.....</text>

I purchased the new hot chicken , 2 chicken littles, 5 piece hot wings a cobet a large pepsi and a pot pie. When I got home, NO pot pie!  I visit this KFC for two reasons. One, I like the food and two this is the only one near me. I have no choice but to patronize this one, but have had other issues with this store. Seems to be poorly managed.<//Review>

<user_name>Ana Guillén<//user_name><Review>(Translated by Google) The chicken knew how to spoil. There is no service in the restaurant, only at the window.
Even so, a Spanish-speaking man attended me, it was the only good thing about the experience.

(Original)
El pollo sabía cómo a punto de echarse a perder. No hay servicio en el restaurante, sólo en ventanilla.
Aún así me atendió un señor de habla hispana, fue lo único bueno de la experiencia.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Quick easy at 930am. Parking is small but since the other shops are not open it wasn't bad. Service was fine, ordered Pike and iced coffee, nothing crazy or out of the ordinary. just needed a Starbucks on my way to my destination, this was the closest one after using the Starbucks app.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Perfect service, friendly staff and fast paced delivery, but for a 60 degree day, AC is blowing way too hard inside. i like walking into a cafe and feeling warm, warming up after the outside, but that isn’t the case. I have a winter coat on and i’m freezing, my hair is fluttering around from the AC blow. Also, i draw, and my fingers freeze on my pen. Not really comfortable working space for an establishment that prides itself with comfortable work space</review>< pictures>

<Text>I go to a lot of Starbucks - I'm from Seattle. This one wasn't as consistent as the others. My drink wasn't what I was expecting (I didn't make any changes, just ordered the menu item I like, I'm simple) but an ingredient was left out. The friend I was with also didn't know if a drink on the counter was his since it had no markings (no name, no boxes checked off) and it took a while to figure out. Maybe it's just an off day.< /Text><Name>Laurel Clark< /Name><Rating>3<//Rating>< gmap_id>

I like this location better than the one on Los feliz a few blocks away because it's usually quieter here. Good service and very relaxed atmosphere. Parking may be hard to come by.</Text>

Went there for a quick cup of coffee and they had none brewed. was told that it would be a few minutes.

Not a happy camper right now.
She could have offered a free.cup or something to be a bit nicer but thats not this place.

I love Starbucks but will never visit this parking challenged location again<//Text>

One of favorite local Starbucks because of its decent size wifi junkie back area. Usually can find a spot here to study/wifi, and plugs/outlets available. Small parking lot, but if wait couple minutes can find one or there's meter and residential street parking. Area is great place to stroll and walk around with wine store next door.</Review>

Worst customer service! Once they have your credit card information, they could care less about you as a customer. We had a sensor go bad and called to schedule an appointment for repair. The gentleman who came out had no idea what to do, as he was a contracted employee with ADT. They rescheduled us with another appointment, with a window from 8 to 12. At 12 o’clock no one had called or showed  up for the appointment. We called ADT to find out they were running behind and could be there more so around 2 o’clock. Let me add, we took the day off work for this appointment and couldn’t even get a phone call of them running late after sitting around all day for our second appointment. We have since been waiting for a phone call back from management, three days later and still have not received a phone call. We have asked for the location of the service center so that we can drive down there to resolve the issues, they will not provide a local address of the ADT business location. As the customer we sit here with an alarm that does not work, missed work days for appointments that they didn’t show up to, and no return phone calls. Pretty much we have no one to turn to, and ADT keeps charging for service. We recommend using a local alarm company. A company that will value you as a customer, stand behind their products, and appreciate your business. We now have to dispute our credit card charges and file a lawsuit, as they have voided their contract by supplying a faulty alarm system that does not work. We made a big mistake using ADT for our alarm system.<//Review>

I would just like to say that Ryan did an excellent job on the installation of my ADT system. As someone who works in the trades I truly appreciate the time and effort he put into making everything look clean and organized. Very good communication and really helped me choose the best placement for all my cameras. You can tell that he truly cares about what he does, people like that are hard to find. He is definitely an asset to your company. Thank you Ryan I appreciate what you have done for me and my family!</Text>

<text>I use the ADT Pulse Service, and I have been very happy with it as a Home Automation Platform.  I currently have Cameras, Thermostats, Lights, and Front Door Locks on the system in addition to typical home security for fire, medical or theft.  It is also very extensible for when I want to add more components all at the same monthly price.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

ADT is the best.  We have been a customer for many years and are very happy with the service.  The mobile app is great, the service technicians are great and the telephone customer service representatives are great.  The system works well and we feel very secure with ADT in our corner.</review>

<Review>Problem: Your questionnaire offers no option for the customer to comment on what issue(s) remain or were problematic.
How can a customer get SERVICE at night or weekends with the the alarm going off because of a failing battery?
The lid on the motion detector can be put on easily if a customer knows the 45 degree angle secret. Otherwise replacing the lid is time consuming and frustrating. Redesign the cover attachment.
A set of directions in a small booklet showing customers to how to check the battery strength of each ADT appliance location would be so helpful. Include in the same booklet instructions to replace the each detection appliances in their wall or ceiling base to properly arm the system again. The system is not armed/ready to test by just replacing the individual appliance battery. The appliance needs to be replacing it in its holder before it is armed and ready to be tested.
The ADT Service agent was very helpful and did a very good job.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1602108599782, 'text': "Hello B. We are truly sorry to hear of this and the frustrations you've endured.

I thought I was buying a system from ADT--however it was another company using ADT and I can't get any of these entities to answer questions and resolve problems.  I would urge anyone, especially a Senor Citizen to never purchase and ADT product unless you confirm absolutely that that is who you are dealing with and your are not burdened with a company like SafeStreets who, together with ADT use each other to make excuses for the deficiencies in their products and services.< /text>

Horrible customer service, constantly trying to trick you into spending more money, my system never works, and I just got a letter from the sheriffs department with a large fine for the alarm not being registered. I have tried to cancel multiple times and am told every time there is nothing they can do unless I want to spend $400+ to cancel it when I was initially told I could cancel anytime without penalty.</Review>< Rate>

A ADT and AT&T representative came to our door. They are like a 3rd party. They told us our bill was going go be 50.00 cheaper and this was going go becon one bill. A month later 60.00 was charged to my bank account. On top of that our camera was not recording. We called ADT and they told us they couldn't help us. Theb we were transferred to a 3rd party. They took our number waited 3 days never called back. We called back two more times and never returned our call. ADT was able to get a tech to look at our camera. The tech verified our camera was not working and he entered that in the notes. After he left the camera stopped recording. We have been charged for the past 3 month with the camera not working. This kinda service is horrible!< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><rate>1<//rate><Time>1599662155753</Time><Text>I would be careful on hiring this companies services. We have a business account with them and have had very poor results with our service. Example, the communication link was lost between our equipment and theirs. We found this while working with the Technician over the phone on a Friday. Unfortunately the business would NOT be armed over the weekend and holiday, but a technician would be there Tuesday. Tuesday comes and NO technician. I call and spend over 20 minutes on hold at 7 am and find out that NOTHING was scheduled. Now our business will sit unarmed for another week. My opinion is that their service is poor, equipment fails, unreliable, and make sure you get everything in writing.<//Text>< user_name>

After using ADT for years, i had to cancel their service due to Covid-19 jobless situation.Then, i was told that i was being sent a refund for the last month service once it was cancelled.
It has been 2 months, but i never get back my refund.
I made several phone calls when I was assured by the manager the refund was being processed, still, ADT never sent it.
When calling again to check on it, they claimed there was no refund because of their new policy. They also admitted that I had been given wrong information for months. Seriously.

Ronil Singh came out last week to inspect our system as there was an issue reported through the call center.  He was profoessional, efficient and very pleeasant.  He explained everything clearly and left me feeling confident our ADT system was working perfectly and we are safe.  Thank you for the excellent, efficient professional service.

ADT is an awful company, they do not do what they say they will and their customer service is abysmal.  After having them for years, we cancelled their service when our alarm was set off and they never responded or acknowledged that it had happened. Then, we were told we were being sent a refund for our service once it was cancelled and, after several months and several phone calls when I was assured the refund was being processed, they never sent it. When calling again to check on it, they claimed there was no refund. They admitted that I had been lied to for months. I would caution you against using them, they are deceitful and unresponsive.</Text>

If i could give negative stars i would, this is the most shady company i have ever delt with. There sales pitchers have no knowledge on what there selling, they have some what type of knowledge on there contract and will coerce you to signing up for a contract which is the worst part your locked in to a contract for 2 years with monthly payments and there 6 month money back guarantee is a load of Bs, there 30 day trial is even more Bs i would highly suggest not doing business with them!!!!!</Text>

Ryan Feuerback met and exceeded all expectations. There was some incorrect information given to my wife and I regarding cost and equipment needed. Ryan went above and beyond to make sure we were properly taken care of. He was able to relate to my situations and concerns as a father to young children. Definitely a quality or quantity type of guy. We appreciate you.<//Text>

<Text>I've been an ADT customer for many years now, starting with a standard system, upgrading to Pulse after several years (teenagers!) and today just went wireless (no more land line).  The customer service throughout has been great!  However, this last experience was absolutely the epitome of what awesome customer service is.  From Denise in customer service, offering to change me to wireless at no charge and having such a cheery countenance, to Ivan, the technician who came out to my house, put up with all my pets, and fixed the wiring and was also just absolutely a great person!  They both clearly know what they are doing and do it with a smile!  Ivan made sure that everything was working before he left and I am a happy Pulse wireless customer!  Thank you ADT for giving my family peace of mind!  I love being able to alarm the house from work if my son forgets to do it when he leaves for school (that teenager forgetfulness).  I also love being able to tell when a door was opened at 3:00 a.m. (hmmm... teenagers).  :)  ADT is great for security and as a parent for monitoring teenagers.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Almazan was Great!!!! Contacted me before arrival which gave me time to prepare. He also arrived early and in this day, most companies and installers do not. He worked quickly and took the extra time to show me how to operate the system and make sure I understood completely. Additionally, he took extra time to hide my wires because he knew that it meant something to me. He could have easily stapled the wires to the wall and left but he didn't. He took on this task as if it was his own home. Great service!!!!<//review>

<username>Kim Vu</username><Time>1578016793199</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The window timeframe given to me was from 12-5. I called at 12:45 to ask for a timeframe. I was told the technician would call me. At 4:00 I still hadn’t heard and needed to have services done that day. I called back and the rep was kind enough to call and make arrangements for another tech to come out. Not only did the other tech call me and told me he would be at my house in ten minutes, he called before the coordinator even knew (I got a call from the coordinator saying he’d come out but maybe after 7 or 8). Thank you Truong for providing such great, quick, and thorough service! Your team put me first ahead of policies/procedures. Thank you!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

He was extremely professional and organized and laid out the entire job, and then proceeded to go through step by step building a security system as if it was his own home. I followed him around like a “Helicopter Parent” as I enjoy learning the latest technology, but also to watch a real professional whom without a doubt knows his job very well. It was a pleasure to meet him and watch him demonstrate his finely honed skills, he is an asset to his company and to those who have the pleasure of meeting him as he is genuine as they come and unfortunately they’re few and far between in this world. No only did I meet a great installer but a friend as well.< /text>< time>

The technician MJ was very great! He explained clearly what the problem was and explained what the best solution and did not try to forcefully sell or add any new product or services we don't need. He gave very good advice and options for future needs. He is a great example of top customer service and professionalism. Kudos!<//Text>

<text>While I had a challenging start to my relationship with ADT, my salesperson and installation technician made up for it.  James Jensen my salesperson showed up on time,  lived up to his commitments, made recommendations to achieve my goals and saved me money where he could. I have high confidence in his abilities and feel comfortable referring him to my family and friends.  My install technician Jason Martin was also great.  Jason knew exactly what he was doing, requiring minimal effort by me, made recommendations to improve my own ideas, and checked in to make sure I understood everything before he left.  I plan to ask for Jason anytime I have work done (if they will let me) because I know it will be done right!  Thanks James and Jason!</text><Rate>5<//Rate>< date>

ADT Tech Alvin  went above and beyond completing the item I needed taking care of on my security system.  He provided me with new security info I was unaware of.  Also, advised of ADT’s Ring system which would be good for additional security.  I appreciate his proactive attitude in making sure he addressed all my concerns as well as providing me with additional security info.<//text>

Mark our Service Tech called before arriving at my residence, with myself being at work and needed time to get home for the appointment. I told him I needed a little time, so he took another service call, and still made it to my residence 20 minutes after our agreed time. Mark was super friendly and explained to me exactly what happened. A real fast fix and did an additional test on my smoke detectors. Thanks again Mark!</text>

ADT Corporation in Sacramento has a Master Service Technician named Ryan Bates.
Ryan is friendly, courteous and extremely knowledgeable about ADT products.  He is very conscientious and truly cares about the customer.  It was a pleasure to have him in my home.  I would highly recommend ADT of Sacramento.

Please be aware that there is an “Authorized Dealer” of ADT called “DEFENDERS”.  They are not the same as ADT Sacramento (which is corporate).  Do not use ANY “ADT Authorized Dealer”.  Save yourself from some headaches.</Text>

Our service technician was Gerald B. Gerald was prompt, courteous, honest and respectful of our house by wearing disposable shoe slip-ons.

We asked Gerald for suggestions on what, if anything, we might consider for alarm upgrades. Gerald offered some suggestions for us to consider but wasn't "pushy" in the least bit. We sincerely appreciated his honesty!

Gerald quickly isolated our problem and corrected it by replacing a defective sensor.

In an time of what seems by be declining customer service coupled with knowledgeable technicians, Gerald was a "breath of fresh air".

ADT should consider itself fortunate to have technicians that are as much a pleasure to work with as Gerald.< /Text>

ADT as a large company has become too large and focused on money and not consumer.   However, I must say the individuals that I have worked with (especially the last few days) have been outstanding people!!   They seemed truly concerned about the issues I was experiencing and truly took the time to help me try and resolve them without sounding like I messed up their day.  I had a technician come out on Christmas Eve and he was awesome and worked through everything in my system until everything worked.  Thank you Ying Yang!!<//text>

Very happy with ADT called customer support talked to Bianca ( who was wonderful and helpful) and she had someone come out that same day ( within 2 hours )this usually doesn't happen with a lot of companies in my experience... to help me get my app on the phone working and to change the battery on the keypad...
Carlos G. was very courteous and professional and even saw a sensor wasn't working in the kitchen and fixed it right away. Again very happy and will recommend ADT to friends and family< /review>

He reviewed the system with me and talked me through every feature and answered all of my questions. You're lucky to have him representing your company.

I own Ultimate Collision Center in Citrus Heights California. I had the pleasure of Ryan Bate coming out to do my install and several modifications at my shop and my home which also is protected by ADT.  Ryan works efficiently and has an outstanding knowledge of his trade I’ve never seen in any previous tech. I recommend him by name to all that have ADT or want ADT servises for his clean installs and professionalism above all others.</Text>

I'm reviewing only the installation of an upgraded system, not how happy I am with the system.
The technician, Eric, arrived on time.  He was very polite and worked to speak clearly so my husband and I could process the information.  The installation went smoothly, and Eric explained each step clearly.  He walked me through the new app, allowing me  time to make decisions how the system should operate.  Finally, Eric had me try various functions of the new system.  He was very helpful and patient.  When he left, he took all leftovers with him, leaving the house as it was when he arrived.  The new system works well.  I'll write again in about 2 weeks, when we've had some actual experience with the system and the app to run it.<//text>

From the start ADT has been great. I got an in home assessment on a Saturday from Ben Ruport, very friendly and knowledgeable. We went over options and I chose my system.
Then, Ryan Feuerbach (installation tech) came and wow. From the start he was willing to answer any and all questions. He went above and beyond to explain and demonstrate the system. Wore shoe covers and was just amazing.
Thank you so much for your professionalism and helping to make my wife and I feel safe<//text>

We had a wonderful experience with ADT! James Compton was our installer today. He was very knowledgeable and spent the time to install our system correctly and then teach me everything about the alarm and the pulse app that goes along with it. Thanks James, I would highly recommend him to anyone!< /Text>

If I could give 10 stars I would for Roland, our ADT  technician!  He resolved a sensor issue.
At the same appointment he was able to answer all our questions in regards to adding equipment. The install   appointment  was set for the following morning. He was timely, paitent,  and very thorough. He answered all of our questions.   Also, he was  very neat with the install. All wires nicely placed. After the install he was very informative of how to use the new equipment. He is very approachable and gave excellent customer service. Great listener.</review>

Had a “trouble” light come on my ADT keypad which indicated low battery. Realizing after I remove the cover plate that the battery pack was pretty specialized, I called for service. They were able to send a service technician that afternoon.
The technician, Ying Yang was very thorough. He checked the batteries on my 2 remotes and the main pack and replaced them appropriately. He also taught me how to set the “stay” control so that there was no delay on the alarm, if someone were to enter while we were home instead of the standard 30 second delay. Great to know and something he shared when he asked me how I set the alarm normally when we were in for the night. Very cool!< /Text>

ADT is easy to get a hold of, has flexible scheduling, and makes securing your house a painless process.

Brian set up my system today and did a great job. In spite of some equipment snafus (not Brian’s fault) and extreme heat, he was patient, friendly, and professional. He was even great with my dog and made sure to let me know if a door would be open.

He answered all of my questions, and now I can rest easy knowing my house is secure. I couldn’t be more satisfied with the service.<//Text>

I just recently had Adam Mott come out to my house and could not be more happy.  The service was great and Adam is always easy to get a hold of if there is any thing that we need. My husband and I have a hard time seeing so he was even nice enough as to print out large instructions on how to use the system and have them by all three keypads in the house.  If anyone is wanting A+ service give ADT a call.<//text>

Must apologize to the nice ladies at the call center who put up with me insisting that there IS NO 8x8 white box!  There is. Ryan found it in my attic. Dotty old lady that I am, I hadn't thought of that.

We had a service request that was fulfilled by Brent Jayne and Ronil Singh last week. From the time the 1st call was initiated and the work was completed both were very professionally respectful and made sure that I was satisfied with every detail of the job. They made everything simple and easy! Would definitely request both for any future installation work.<//Review>

<Text>Robert Williams was very nice. Even took the time to call me that he was on his way to our house.  Robert knew his job very well. He fixed the problem by doing something which other technicians did not do. Robert said, if it comes on again that it is important to call the office.
I have had problems with our ADT control of the yellow triangle coming on.  I have been a customer of ADT for many years. My wife and I are seniors and retired. ADT protected us for many years.  Millions thanks for their Tecnicians serving us to live safe..
Technician came in January 2018 for the same problem. The problem was fixed but not for long; the yellow triangle came on again. I did not pay attention anymore about it. Just got tired of it.Then I called ADT office. Spoke to a lady and did some test. Finally, She arranged an appointment for a Technician which was Robert to come to our house.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I have the pleasure of recommending service technician Ryan Bates. He is polite (nearly to a fault), honest about what you don’t need, what you do need and what will work best for your home; he always has a smile on his face and is knowledgeable about the full range of ADT services and products. It is rare to come across someone as genuine and honest as Ryan and these qualities are of utmost importance when you’re trusting them to secure your home. Trust me (random person on the internet) and ask for service technician Ryan Bates.<//Text>

I just wanted to personally say how awesome your rep was who came to our home. We wanted to get cameras but decided not too. We wanted something different like the Ring. Your knowledgeable rep discussed what we wanted and suggested ADT actually sells and installs the Ring doorbell.

Not only did he set us up, he made us feel like we are actually happy to stay with ADT and add the Ring - all thanks to him. He checked all our batteries and the system to make sure it was all working good too. In all the 3 years we had ADT,  we never had such a thorough tech.

Good job Ronil. Thank you ADT for sending him.</Review>

<Review>We’ve been with ADT for a few years now and we decided to upgrade our service! The technician Truong Pham was very friendly and professional! He provided excellent customer service! He explained our new system and all its wonderful features! We love our new upgrade and appreciate the technician getting here early and getting everything installed in a timely manner!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< review>
ADT is a total rip off!  Since I've had my alarm it has gone off three times.
Two of the three times I didn't touch it.  The first time it took the police almost 4 hours to get to my house.  I had called ADT to cancel them, yet they didn't do it.  However, what's with the almost 4 hour wait?!  I spoke to  some other Sacramento City Police and they said that alarms were low priority and they didn't have to come if they if they had more important things to do. (Makes sense to me.) There is a significant amount of violent crime in Sacramento which is the Sac PD's priority.  The second time it went off without anybody touching the alarm, no police came.  The
third time it went off when my handyman opened the door by mistake.  He waited for the police and they did come about an hour later.  I spoke with 4 people from ADT; they were rude and obnoxious.  In essence they said, it's not their fault if the police don't go out.  Total idiots.  I said that's like me going to the grocery store and paying for a bag of groceries and I only get an empty bag.  The people at ADT wouldn't be able to understand the analogy.  Small claims court here I come!  Bye, Bye ADT!!!</review>

The technician Truong Pham, was very knowledgeable, professional and patient while showing me how to use the Ring app. He answered ALL my questions. He was very friendly and didn't make me feel that I was asking too many questions. He's a definite asset to your company.  I wish all installers for all companies were as thorough and nice as he is.

<text>My husband Carl and I give ADT technician Brian Molitaris our highest rating for professionalism, customer service, expertise, thoroughness and communication skills.  We have been subscribers of ADT since 2005 and had recently explored other options for home security since we had eliminated our land-line.  However, Brian's exceptional service and willingness to take the time to explain the benefits of remaining with ADT won us over.  ADT is most fortunate to have Brian Molitaris as a valued representative of its team!  His exceptional attributes and service inspire continued confidence and trust in your company.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
Ryan Bates came to Solano Wellness Spa in Fairfield to fix our shop security camera to which a couple technicians came before him, both technicians mentioned that they are unable to fix the issue that they have to call in the expert tech to come and fix it.

Ryan did not waste anytime and performed a minor troubleshooting and made sure every angle was checked and without hesitation removed and replaced the camera and made sure that my account is not charged for additional charges.

He took care of his accounts and made sure that his clients are satisfied.

10 stars.< /Review>

<time>1544143444052<//time><rating>1</rating><Review>My cloud camera service has been disconnected four times over the last year now for no explainable reason, and I have been unaware each time.

They do not care if you are paying monthly and receiving nothing in return. They even increased their rates last month.

If something happens, I have no peace of mind when I am gone because I'm wasting money on a company that does not care about my safety or security.

Each tech they've sent has never seen this camera and both of our times are wasted when they leave.

I cannot recommend this company.

<Time>1536561944588<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I was very lucky by having James. F as my technician. He was very polite and respectful. When he got to my house, he put on some shoe cover without me even asking before stepping around my house to do his work. I seriously love that and that also tells me a lot of how respectful he is.  We don't wear shoes in my house and mainly because I"m a neat freak, lol! Anyways I was so happy to see that he came well prepared. Prior to having ADT, we had Xfinity security alarm (biggest mistake ever) and the technician that had came over to install the alarms was really rude and also wore shoes in my house. He even used my side table for extra hight to install the alarms, left his shoe print on it too and didn't care to wipe it off. Which I found super rude. NEVER AGAIN!

James was very knowledgeable of his work and I loved that. He taught me how to use the security pad and also how to access my account online and explain every step online on what I can do online. I had a lot of questions and he was able to answer them all with confidence and patience, that was very nice of him. Thank you James.
Overall James. F was a excellent Technician and I hope he gets recognized at work for his excellent service.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I'm only giving your horrible company 1 star but the techs that came out yesterday and Jason Martin that came today deserve 10 stars they were absolutely and amazingly kind professional, they're the only reason I'm staying with ADT honestly!! The customer service and customer care in your company is disgusting and downright despicable!! You don't care about your customers! I'd give you negative stars if I could, but I don't want to screw over the poor techs reviews like they did something wrong!!! Your company lies, and blames customers for your own mistakes. I could go on for days about you, but I won't, you won't get anymore of my energy!! If I were you and you're thinking of getting an alarm go to ANOTHER COMPANY!!!<//text><rating>1</rating><UserId.>116309821343028832599</UserId.>< response>

<Review>Our technician James Fugate was very professional and polite.  He knew everything about our new system and how to replace all of the stuff from the old one.  He was very patient with both my wife and I and took the time to explain everything, even when we asked the same stupid questions repeatedly.  He was very patient when showing us how to use our new equipment.  He was very fast when installing the system and when something was wrong with the internet connection to our new garage door controller he knew exactly how to troubleshoot the problem and fixed it quickly.  James also completed our install early as he was so quick with the install.  The quality of the install was also top notch, he didn’t cut any corners despite being efficient.  I felt very comfortable with having James in my home, unlike some of the other technicians from different companies (cable guy, plumbers).<//Review><pics>None</pics><rating>5<//rating><Resp>{'time': 1546181521044, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5-star rating.

Refreshing experience. We’ve had Adt for about 25 years thru all of our moves. One thing I learned was never have an adttech come out. They probably wouldn’t show, and if they did it would be an awful experience. Eric D. Was great. He fixed everything, showed me what was wrong, and did a great job.</text>

Great service! Tech came out on time  called to confirm  and was very professional.

We had the distinct pleasure of having James Fugate being the assigned individual to install our system in our house yesterday at 285 Saint Tropez Lane in Lincoln.  James was the extreme gentlemen and thankfully, a self proclaimed 'A.D.D.' installer.  He went above beyond to give great consideration to all alternatives and consulted me along the way to make sure I was in agreement   The end result was a fastidiously installed security alarm system that brings peach of mind to my wife and I.   James was thorough, patent, diligent and very professional  We even bought him lunch!< /Text>

<text>ADT technician Mr. Truong Pham was very thorough in trouble shooting our hacked up alarm system and his workmanship was detailed and neat. He clearly stated what some of the challenges he found and how he was going to correct those issues to get our system up and running. He also very clear and went step by step with his instructions on how to correctly arm and disarm our alarm system by using the alarm panel and cell phone. Mr. Pham demeanor is friendly, warm, informative and professional. And he wore shoe coverings during his install which showed a lot respect for my dad's house.
Thanks Mr. Truong Pham for the great customer service.</text>< Pictures>

Jim Jensen was our first contact with ADT. He was very helpful and respectful when giving us information about ADT's services. I appreciated that he wasn't pushy but only interested in giving us the information we felt like we needed in order to update our current equipment and get started with ADT. CJ Toby, the technician who came this morning, was very knowledgeable and prompt and worked quickly and efficiently. Right away I had confidence in his abilities to install the hardware we needed. He answered our questions and on leaving, offered to be available if we had any other questions as time goes by. I texted him just a few minutes ago (around 8:30 p.m.) with a question and got an answer back immediately. Thanks to ADT for having Jim and CJ on your team!<//Text>

<review>Everyone I have interacted with has been very nice, otherwise this would be one star.

Camera has been out for over two weeks (or more??); the light just went out yesterday so I thought it was active. I logged into the portal (which is clunky and annoying to navigate) to find there has not been any recordings for the last two weeks.
I thought a security company would have some kind of notification if their customer's cameras go out as a common courtesy considering they are there for protection and peace of mind. An email, at the very least.

Oh fortunately, they were able to send someone out to check it out, but couldn't provide an ETA because they only do that for residential customers...

As soon as I am out of contract with them I am going to set up my own camera system on a personal server; I would rather deal with that headache than a company that does not care about their customers' protection.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1523148088191, 'text': 'Hi Arezu, We are very sorry for the inconvenience.

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have been an ADT Customer since 1998 which is a l-o-n-g time, isn’t it?  However, my ADT experiences is not installing an alarm system for one house but, installing an alarm system for TWO DIFFERENT HOUSES:

First House

SF Bay Area-1998 until 2016~SOLD HOUSE!  The New Owners LOVES😍 their ADT CCTV SYSTEM!

Second House

NORCAL-2017 to present~Brand new, stick build, construction house-Thank you so very much, Ian Cook for assisting me paying for my alarm system in advance; the pre-wire installation was performed by Jason (Thank you so very much🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏼👏🏼!).  After pre-wiring the new house and finally, closing escrow, Jason and Tech, James returned installing the CCTV PULSE ALARM SYSTEM.

Initial DVR operated well until February 2018:  The DVR was replaced due to the fan inside the DVR burned out; aside, all CCTV PULSE Cameras were operating flawlessly UNTIL October 1, 2018 when one of the cameras’ IR failed operating during nightime but, oddly-during the day, video was viewing images perfectly!  Hmmmm~Strange🙄.

Regardless, I must give a gargantuan shout out to ADT’s Ryan Bates for modernizing my CCTV PULSE SYSTEM on October 5, 2018:

Ryan replaced the defective IR camera and installed two additional cameras plus, Ryan mounted the DVR to a wall in my home in order, maximizing as a space-saving measure and more importantly, Ryan re-wired the pre-existing wires Jason initially installed so, the alarm circuitry wires won’t affect my storage space!

Kudos, Bravo, and 100 TRILLION THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR CARING HOW MY ADT CCTV PULSE SYSTEM MUST OPERATE EASILY AND FLAWLESSLY, Ryan-You’re my ADT Hero!!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

Duong Huynh installed my security system on September 19, 2018.

Me. Huynh  is considered a subject matter expert (sme) in his field. He made some very helpful suggestions to ensure that I was provided with the best seevice to protect me and my home.

Mr. Huynh instantly noticed hazardous cords installed by a previous technician and corrected it immediately.

Mr. Huynh displayed professionalism the entire time he was performing the installation.

My new system was hooked up and looks very nice and professional.

Thank you Mr. Huynh for all of your assistance.

Take care and be safe

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Kathryn Tedford, my new ADT rep and Ryan Feuerbach my new ADT installer came out today and refreshed my system. Typically once the person working with you that sells you the equipment doesnt show up when the installers arrive. But Kathryn did. As a business owner we are constantly bombarded from people trying to sell something to us. These two were more giudes in the kindest way. Simply here offereing thier service and we couldnt be more impressed with the time and attention they spent with me. So, I highly recommend ADT's Kathryn and Ryan for all your Commercial or residential security, surveillance and automation needs. You will be impressed.<//Text>< date>

Working with Ciamack Azimpour, Security Specialist, was a pleasure.  No high pressure sales.  Walked us through the process and was very patient with all of our questions.  Master Technicians, Oleg Postolaki and James (I apologize as I forgot his last name) were friendly, and again, patient with all of our questions.  Love the outside cameras!  We did run into a small problem, and Oleg responded quickly and walked me through the process to repair.  Thank you, Oleg.  Definitely would recommend these people.< /Review>

Still ADT said my roommate who had moved out was in control and told me I would have to find him to write a letter saying he didn't live here . I was left without service unprotected a single mom with a young son with autism because I asked him to call to make the appointment for me a year ago . Hours of crying on the phone with three very nice customer service representatives but they couldn't help then one horrible upper management who yelled and laughed at me . Finally the contract ran out and I was able to set ADT up in my name . I was hesitant about signing up with ADT again after the way I was treated but I did . Today was my appointment . Truong showed up end of a hot day , he must have been tired but he went above and beyond to replace my equipment , he was helpful , patient , inefficient and made sure we had everything working properly .
I felt comfortable with him in my home he was polite making sure to watch for my cats and making sure he would shut the door tight to keep my cats from getting out .
Great communication . Trunog is  professional and a credit to your company .
I appreciate everything he did today .
He saved ADT another service visit by taking time to locate a new panel box for me and having it delivered here , he could just gone home and left us without service and made us  wait for the next appointment but he didn't .
Thank you very much .
I'm very happy how everything went we are setup and that makes me feel safe !
So thanks again Trunog !
