I look forward to my relaxing time there once a month. I also appreciate the cleanliness of this salon from the front door to the bathrooms. Today, I'm trying something new at Serenity, I'm getting my  eyebrows micro-bladed. I give Serenity Salon & Spa my highest recommendation.<//text>< username>

Will never purchase a Groupon from Sweet Serenity again! Almost impossible to get a date that suits my schedule. They are happy to receive your money but won't accommodate your need for service.< /review>

<date>1553550132088</date><rate>4<//rate><Review>I went in for a massage and it was so relaxing.  Wasn’t sure if I should get the Swedish or deep tissue so I explained my situation and settles for something in between and walked out feeling so much better. I forgot the massage therapists name and feel so bad about it. She was so nice and attentive. I definitely recommend trying this place. The reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars is because I could hear someone out in the hall taking a phone call. They do a good job of playing relaxation sounds in the room, but the person on the phone was really loud. I would recommend they hold off on making calls in that hall while the massage rooms are being used.< /Review>< pics>

Once I arrived at my appointment, about 10mins early, Tammy greeted me and provided me a questionnaire to fill out.  As I was filling out the questionnaire, Tammy and a friend (or previous client) were talking about someone's recent death which I get it, life happens, death happens, but it really was a really dark way to start what should have been a relaxing and calming experience.  After the questionnaire, Tammy offered me two options for my massage, either the Swedish massage or a deep tissue. The fine print of her Groupon states “Valid only for option purchased” but still she offered.  I took the deep tissue massage since she presented it as a better option for the issues I was trying to address.  I found out later that the deep tissue is a lower value, so not quite what I paid for.  Also, during the massage itself, Tammy seemed distracted and her phone kept going off throughout the session.  Even if distracted, the massage still felt amazing and was much needed. I still tipped $20, which is roughly 18% of the listed retail value of the Swedish massage w scrub and 30% of the deep tissue I actually received.  Now, about a month later, Goupon popped up stating I might be interested in the Sweet Serenity Massage deal “Three 60-Minute Swedish Massages with Body Scrubs”. I was willing to chalk up the rough previous experience as just a bad day and purchased the new deal since Tammy’s massage techniques were more enjoyable than previous massage therapists I had gone to.  I purchased the deal and texted Tammy to set up the appointments. No response. Ok, I gave her some time.  Texted again the following day.  No response.  Third day, Tammy replies “Groupon is one per person unless 3 pack is purchased first time” and suggests I ask Groupon for a refund.  I am aware of how Groupon works, I have purchased multiple Groupons and know that if you attempt to repurchase a deal that does not abide by the offer policy it states “This order exceeds the purchase maximum for this deal.” I did not get any error and was allowed the purchase.  Also, since Tammy veered away from her own policy I thought she would still make the exception.  I explained that I enjoyed her technique and like she mentioned during our session I carry a lot of tension due to working a full time stressful job, taking care of two kids and helping out with my sick mother.  I could really benefit from a series of good massages and would continue to be a good client for her.  No response. So, even though Tammy really is skillful at her job, she lacks customer service skills. I don’t recommend her and will be seeking out that refund as well as a new massage therapist.<//review>< Pics>

I always been getting service in NY at QQ Salon for many years. Moved out to CA and tried my nails with Serenity Salon & Spa. The staff is super nice but they should learn to do a better job. My nails curticles was not clean thouroughly,  and its a rip off Nail Salon. For a  regular manicure without nail polish they charged me $40 and it was not done proper at all. If the lady would of clean my curticles well I wouldn't mind paying this much but I do not advice to visit this place.< /text>

<review>This salon was terrible. I purchased an shampoo/conditioner combo pack for color treated hair, used it for a few days and then realized it was killing my hair. I called the salon, assuming they had some sort of procedure in place as I'm sure this is not the first time this has happened before. I explained the situation, stating that I had only used the shampoo/conditioner twice and was told returns had to occur with a receipt, within 60 days, and only for unused products. When I asked what if the product I had paid good money for was killing my hair, I was put on hold and passed to another associate, who I'm assuming was the manager, but was only given the name Carly, with no title. I was told that I could not return the product and she suggested giving the product to a family member as a Christmas gift, which was absolutely outrageous. I will not going to give used shampoo/conditioner as a gift and will certainly not be purchasing any more items from a salon that thinks this is an acceptable practice. I was stunned and horrified by their policies, procedures, and customer service. I would not suggest this salon to anyone.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea42ffb7928b17:0x5aec1b6caabc9628<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The space and prices are great and cheaper than I'm used to but the service is a bit more layed back and we tried to cancel a refill to leave since we waited a while and was told no refund even though they hadn't made it yet. Still went back again< /text></record></dataset><record>

The owner is super nice! But the hookah is terrible tastes like straight coal . I ordered pina colada and there is no flavor what so ever! The coals are super small and instead of delivering it hot they let it sit on your hookah tray.</review>

< review>
I recently went to this dermatologist because I had some suspicious areas on my skin.  I was seen by an MD rather than a PA, which I liked.  She was thorough—did a full body check.  She also took care of some skin tags and bumps around my eyes in two minutes.  I had discussed these areas  with three other Dr’s—dermatologists and ophthalmologists— and NONE would help me.  She did.  They were no big deal!  Thank you!  She would have done more, but I stopped due to discomfort.  But it was well worth it.<//review>

< Review>
Is it just me...?
Seems like the bigger SC&D gets the worse it gets. Super long wait times, nearly impossible to reach by phone, endless forms and today my 94 year old mom has to wait in the parking lot while much younger folks are allowed to plop down inside.
My mom has Alzheimer’s and change is hard on her otherwise this would be our last visit.
I gave them three stars only because most of the staff is nice.</Review>

This medical visit was the most degrading medical visit that I’ve ever had. She was so cold and insulting and her assistant had the same attitude. She was only interested in doing a biopsy to make money and treated me like a specimen to cut. Her remarks were terribly offending.<//Review>

Dr. Kam is friendly and we have seen her for years. I feel the exams are too cursory. Since she does not take pictures, I am not sure how she can tell if there are changes from year to year. The new management system screwed up our appointments in September, and we arrived to an empty office, and were informed that we had been rescheduled. Fortunately the new system has facilitated virtually no waiting prior to being taken to an exam room. Years ago we would wait as long as an hour in the waiting room.< /Text>

This office takes covid precautions very seriously. I was met at the door by the receptionist who was masked and gloved. She took my temperature and asked me the screening questions. Next she reassured me that the pens and clipboards are all sanitized after patient use. They also had a plastic barrier between the receptionist desk and the waiting room. I felt very safe.
Dr. K was professional and overall it was a great appointment.</text>

I have no idea how their services are as I had to call 3 different phone numbers to finally leave a message. I am literally trying to give the a “fee for service” yet I have never experienced something so difficult and inept as their process. If they are spending any money on external marketing it is going straight out the door because they can’t pick up the phone. Their phone system should be a business case in how to loose money.<//review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Renewal is great Dr. Kamenetsky and her staff are quick but thorough. They follow Covid protocol by wearing masks, requiring patients to wear masks. They check your temperature at the door and ask you questions about any travel, symptoms you may have or the people you have been around in the past 14 days. They make both the patient and staff feel safe.< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>Can't say enough good things about my experience at Skin Cancer & Dermatology Institute in Truckee, CA.  The office was inviting and clean. The best part of my procedure was Shiloh Boyer. She really cared about my experience,  my comfort and made sure I understood every part of the procedure.  She went the extra mile.  I left knowing what I would face in the weeks to come and I could contact her with any questions.  I give Shiloh a 10 out of 10 rating.<//text>< user_id>

It was really hard to get an appointment as they are booked out about a month, I had to take an appointment on my 30 minute lunch break. They knew I was in a hurry and were able to accommodate me. Great service by front desk, MA and the Doctor. Definitely recommend!< /review>

Great experience.  Saw Dr. Kamenetsky and she immediately took care of what I needed without having to set up another appointment.  I will see her yearly to make sure all is okay. Her staff is very knowledgeable and professional with a very caring attitude.  Couldn't ask for more.<//text>

Since I visit about every six months, it seems a bit redundant to fill out a complete health history every time. Should incorporate into medical record/billing software. Otherwise visit good.</review>

I was extremely disappointed with my visit. My first appointment was booked out a month in advance, which was okay. I was really really looking forward to my appointment. I had so many questions that I had held onto for years and I was so excited to finally get some answers! Dr. Kamenetsky came in with an assistant who carried an iPad. Her assistant just stood in the corner scrolling through the iPad and every now and then she would say something about my chart and point and the doctor would say thats fine or I'm not worried about that. Im right there! You are more than welcome to address me as well. If the MA has questions about my chart and I'm sitting right there ask them! Don't have side conversations about me while I'm 5 feet away.  During my 10 minutes or so with her, another MA kept walking in and asking Dr. Kamenetsky questions, about other things going on in the office. This is what really irritated me! This was MY 10 minutes. And I can't even get out a full thought with out constantly being interrupted. I was so annoyed that I couldn't even gather my thoughts. The questions I did ask, were answered with vague answers or just completely dismissed. Just take these meds and everything will be fine. But thats not why I went in there. I went in there for answers! Not a temporary fix that is just going to make me have to keep checking in once a month. Not to mention she gave me meds for high blood pressure to treat my skin, but she wanted to check my blood pressure first to make sure I didn't have low blood pressure. It was 100/something which is normal for me while sitting. She just dismissed my low blood pressure and gave me the meds anyway. I walked away getting NOTHING out of that 10 minute appointment. And Im honestly scared to death to take the meds knowing how low my blood pressure goes when I lay or stand. I would not recommend her.</text>

They only had expired biopsy collection containers, so we missed an opportunity to collect the fluid from a blister which popped later in the day. Missed rare opportunity.</Review>

< review>
21 days ago I had my first full body exam/scan at this dermatology and it was great. The front desk staff was friendly and fast. In the lobby while you wait there’s informative reading material regarding skin care, protection and rejuvenation. The PA was friendly and helped provide a smooth service flow.  Last but not less, Dr. Kamenetsky was professional, listened and didn’t make anything awkward. She was proactive removing and testing a mole that same day. Follow up was fast and they will send me a reminder for next year’s appointment.  Overall they have a  great office that all in this community should visit. #protectyourskin<//review>

<Text>Quality of care is exceptionally low.  They missed an obvious cancerous spot after a complete full body derm exam which I found after the visit.  They had a nurse or receptionist call to communicate what could be serious biopsy results who couldn't answer questions and just said they'd call back at some point with next steps on a referral.  A stunningly poor healthcare services experience.  I would highly recommend avoiding this practice except for maybe cosmetic work.</Text><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>102347820381263483747</UserId.>< username>

<review>I am in North Carolina & I have a sister that I love ❤️ Dearly and I always send her flowers... She lives in Vallejo California....I would never use another florist but B&B... I recently sent these flowers to her on her 62nd Birthday she’s holding... The huge arrangement of flowers is when she turned 60 and B&B did a fabulous job of making 60 Roses for me... .I always ask for Jay or Linda they are absolutely fabulous with their work and have great ideas.< /review><user>103566165016650479881<//user>< gmap_id>

Wow! Linda at B&B Floral gave us the best experience today I just had to share! I was hoping for same-day but had missed the cut off. She made it happen anyway! The ordering process was so easy, friendly and personal. I don't ever want to use those big third party websites ever again.
The custom arrangement that came for my mother-in-law was absolutely lovely - beautiful bright and with happy healthy flowers and fun greenery. It matched exactly the description I had given and more. I will definitely be using B&B again!< /Review>

I placed an online order and received prompt email confirmation. I live in Central California and was worried about placing an order for floral delivery, especially during this time, but everything went far much better than I could have hoped for. I would highly recommend this florist and will now continue to use them for my relative that lives in Vallejo.  Thank you so much for your service.</review>

For my  brother's June 2016 wedding, their motif was blue and yellow gold. We ordered the flowers from B&B Floral a week before the wedding and the lady owner was super helpful. They delivered it on time. Our guests, the receptionist and everyone in Hiddenbrooke Golf Club who saw these flower arrangements gave us great compliments ! I will definitely order from B & B Floral in our future special occasions.</Review>

Terrible customer service. Super snappy over the phone and was ranting about how I shouldn’t have ordered through teleflora instead of directly through them. I live over a thousand miles away and picked them at random and they denied my order because they don’t like to do business with teleflora. So now I’m SOL because they just don’t like teleflora. I got to hear him complain about everything and he did absolutely NOTHING to help me get this resolved.< /text>

Recently order casket flowers for a funeral requested gold leaves , white & blue flowers for the Rams because my brother in law loved them , when we received the flowers on the day of they were not what we wanted the flowers were noticeably purple instead of blue being the day off we couldn't get anything from another flower shop we contacted & my sister just recently losing her husband put off making a big deal until others brought it to her attention so she decided to go to the floral shop and let them know what had happened but the reaction she got was not one of good customer service instead of being compassionate and apologetic she was told she was basically wrong and they were blue not purple to avoid confrontation she just left and will not use there services again , if anyone decides to use them check your flower order prior to deliver to make sure it's what you want not what they can come up with at the time.<//Text>

Truly, the flowers had not even arrived at their intended destination, when they contacted the recipient to determine when she will be home, as they were too concerned about leaving such a precious bouquet unattended on the front porch. An over the top bouquet was hand delivered by its creator by the end of the day. Superb customer care and quality!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I called Linda from Texas.  She did a fantastic job of creating a masterpiece flower arrangement for a very special young lady. The flowers were beautiful and the arrangement was much larger than I thought it would be.  Great price, wonderful customer service and would definitely recommend them!< /text>

I absolutely adore this salon. I made an appointment for a mani/pedi on the advice of a friend and I was not disappointed. Amazing detailed work on both my hands and feet. And the massage??? Feels like heaven. Definitely will be a client from now on. Highly recommended.</Review>

Really really kind/nice people!! my gel mani usually start chipping within a couple days.
I still come back tho bc the ladies are so nice :) -update- they recommended switching from just gel to a dip then gel mani for longer lasting nails. It’s been almost a week and no chips in sight!< /Review>

<Text>Kelly and Hannah, these are my girls. It took me forever to find a nail place I trust and amazing people that know how to do nails flawlessly. I have been going here for the past 7 years and will continue to go for years to come. I love the fact that everyone is so personable and always so welcoming.

Additionally, I can confirm that the negative review written below does not stand true, AT ALL!!! Highly HIGHLY recommend coming here (and the colors are pink, which is a plus for me because it’s my favorite color).</Text>< pics>

Unfortunately the bad reviews wrote today are not reflective of the treatment I’ve been receiving for the last 8 years. Nancy and her team are hard working professionals that take extreme pride on their work and do everything to make their customers happy. I’ve been a loyal customer and love their work.</text>

When I used to work in WEHO, this is my go to place!! They always always accommodate last minute walk in because I'm the worst at planning my day/week/month so I'm always waiting until my nails looking ratchet and then freak out.

All the employees there are very professional and genuine, most importantly, they will make sure you leave happy with your nails. I specially like getting my  nails did with them male technicians Because they know what men like them ladies nails look like!! Hehehe

Definitely recommend all y'all last-minute-non-planner-ratchet-nails-having-self ladies to come here and get it done sis.</text>

I witnessed the situation today and saw that the nail technician was simply asking for payment before the polish was applied as to not mess it up afterwards. I do believe anyone who's gotten their nails done at anytime in their life knows this is standard protocol? To make such serious and devastating accusations under a false pretense is carless and uncalled for.<//text>< Pics>

If u go to any nail salon they almost always ask for payment before services so you dont mess up your nails getting ur card or money in ur purse after...to say thats racial profiling is so wrong SO WRONG....blown out of proportion! These people at the salon are making an hoenst living...and for it to be threatened bec these famous people are throwing a fit is unacceptable<//text>< pics>

I never post negative reviews but this was shocking.
Waaaay overcharged $75 for acrylic nails that do not even look that great!
Watch out for Sam - he does a fair job was very sneaky with extra adding on prices he never informed upfront. no acrylic nails should be $75 even with gel.
Never going back
There are much better nail salons out there that will do a better job and half the price of this.<//Review>< Pics>

We are obsessed with the reflections wine, so delicious. The winery tasting area is beautiful and everyone who works there is lovely. We also had a delicious cheese board at our tasting!<//Review>

Lovely views, beautiful patio. All wines served and sold use estate varietals. Very tasty blends and single varietals. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Review>Great wine tasting in beautiful gardening in Paso Robles. The few complaint I have is the staff wasn’t wearing mask in entire time of our staying in this time being and she wasn’t knowledgeable since it was her 5th day of working and she just poured the wine and goes back to inside.<//Review>< pictures>

So glad we came here! Everything was excellent, the grounds are beautiful and great for kids to run around, and the staff was so friendly. They brought us complimentary bread and olive oil from the olive trees onsite, and they poured three extra tastings with our flight. It was so nice to be able to bring our own food and picnic at their tables.</text>

Awesome boutique winery in Paso Robles. They have small production and hand crafted skills. Paul and David make wines comparable to much more expensive ones at an attractive price point. Taylor and the other staff treat you as a treasured guest. Beautiful surroundings. Go go go.<//text>

Nice staff, relaxing peaceful winery. The owner was very helpful with our wine selection and purchase. Enjoyed their French process wine, very much what I expect to find in a winery. Looking forward to my return.</Review>

One of my best wine tasting experiences ever. Everyone was kind and friendly and generous. The lavish green grounds are so comfortable, it would be easy to spend the whole day there with a picnic, tossing the bean bags with friends and family, or even reading a book over unrushed sips of carefully crafted wine. I highly recommend this stop, and leave plenty of time!< /Text>

Love this winery.
Estate Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah.
We are members and went to our first pick up party (apr 2016).
It was lots of fun.
We are 12 bottle members so we get 30% off wines.
At pickup party they offered 10% additional off.
We bought more wine.< /Review>

I have been here twice with my cars. To upgrade the sound of my exhaust.
I cant complain, the price was great. I initially had stopped at two other shops and they wanted my arm and leg. This place is great.< /review>

I went to these guys acoupe years back.   I asked them for some super 10s(Flowmasters)     they said the car was done and I went to pick it up.  Car sounded ok but not as strong as I thought.  I should have checked.   I went to another shop to get some work done on my pipes and they told me there were no Flowmaster on my car.   They were cheap mufflers.   I should have checked sooner.  Its been like 5 yrs now but they cheat ypu if you don't know about mufflers.  Be careful.<//text>

<review>Took car in after 3 years of underbody rattle. Had been told it was catalytic converter yet it passed smog 2 times within the 3 years. Was recommended to All American Muffler. Super nice people. Honest, Friendly, Quick service.  It only cost $210.00 to Flex fix. Definately recommend this business.<//review><GmapID>0x80945fbdfc5efe23:0xf5ce128c56a4d27f</GmapID>< Pictures>

Solid muffler shop had my first car, 68 Cougar done there in the late 80s think it was 100 bucks for dual exhaust. 33 years later had my Silverado done there! Still in business doing something right!!<//Review>

The owner is super nice. He showed me where my exhaust was leaking from and gave me a quote to fix it. I liked the price so they went ahead and fixed it in under an hour. They have complimentary water which came in handy since it was kinda hot the day I went in. They have three car lifts so they're able to get customers in and out quickly. You can tell they strive for perfection because before they finalize all their welds, they make sure your exhaust tip(s) are straight and true from the back of the car. Highly recommended for all exhaust needs.</Review>

< review>
I went in and the owner and staff was so friendly...I wasn't expecting to get my car fixed same day, since I came in the evening. They looked at my vehicle, and gave me a amazing price and fixed it on the spot. My car is quiet now, and it run smooth. My Dad referred me to them, and I'm very happy with they're service. If I need work in the future, I will defiantly be a returning customer. Thanks you guys!!< /review>

< review>
I had to get my exhaust hook re welded. So I read all the good reviews to this place and thought of how it would be, turns out, the cutomer service sucked. As I was trying to explain what I needed done to Eric, he stops me in the middle of my explanation and says, “ I don’t need to hear anymore.” So in my head, that was pretty rude to say to a customer. I was just trying to explain so that way I don’t get charged an arm and a leg because I didn’t have too much money on me at the time. So overall, they welded 2 hooks so it can hook on to the rubber pieces.< /review>

I've been going to All American Muffler for about some 27 years now.  I have always received excellent work and warranty on all the work done.  Eric has serviced all the vehicles I owned since 1990; I find him to be honest and direct about explaining what needs to be done and the cost of repair.  I continue to be a returning customer for all my muffler needs, even though I live in North East Fresno.
THANK YOU ERIK!</text>

I priced Catalytic Converters online first and then called All American. They quoted me a better than fair price for the cat + installation.  I just showed up and they took me right away and did an expert job on my Nissan ZX.  I drove it home feeling great about the service, price and workmanship.  This is a family owned business, with people who care about what they're doing.< /review>

We were in a bind, a rear dual blowout on our motor home had crushed our tail pipe extension.  They took us right in, cut off the bad part, fabricated a new 3" tail pipe, and welded it on.  Out in an hour and at a price that left me felling like I cheated them.  Did I mention that they have a 10 ton four post lift.  Five stars is not enough.  Thank you.< /review>

Mission Valley Metro has everything you need. It's in the prime location of, shopping center, malls, car dealerships, freeway. It's the epicenter of san Diego. you can drive to the beach or downtown. The complex has different kinds of nice Amenities. Including 2 stories 24-hour gym, which I love. A big beautiful pool and jacuzzi. great parking structure that leads you to your own level. the amazing Leasing staff and property manager that greets you with a pleasant welcoming feeling. The complex is always clean and the people here are very nice. The studio I got is just perfect and beautiful. thank you metro :)< /text>

From the moment I had my property tour, to the decision to become a resident, to my lease signing process, to any time I've needed anything, the leasing agents and staff at Metro Mission Valley have been nothing but a pleasure to work with.

Agata met me with incredible energy and made me feel at home before Metro became my home. Her and Victor have made all my experience dealing with resident inquires nothing but easy, helpful and FAST. I've never had any issues since being a resident at Metro, except for my own personal misunderstanding some lease terms, but every time i've had any questions, they have always been answered with PROMPT, PROFESSIONAL, EFFECTIVE, CUSTOMER CENTRIC COMMUNICATION.

The property being beautiful, clean, quiet, and safe is a plus, (the groundskeepers are very pleasant and sweet too!)  but having such PROFESSIONAL, PATIENT, ATTENTIVE, RESIDENT/CUSTOMER CENTRIC
Staff is like an extra cherry on my sundae.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE MISSION VALLEY YOUR HOME, take a tour at Metro and ask for Agata or Victor. Tell them a happy resident sent you!<//text>

<user_name>Jeri Esteban</user_name><time>1598407545828</time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>PROS:
- Location! Being walking distance to Mission Valley and Fashion Valley Mall, and close to major freeways in SD
- Newer apartment quality compared to most communities in this area
- Amenities are beautiful
- Open parking in garage, there’s usually always a spot

CONS:
- Weird construction details in some layouts, ie no kitchen drawers for utensils, pull out counter space, poor craftsmanship with attention to detail
- Constant smell and stains of dog urine in hallways, and dog feces in garage that is left for days
- Mail and trash rooms are often full of trash and messy
- Sonder units that are constantly being rented and flipped for new guests; I was told that this wouldn’t be an issue anymore but we lived below a Sonder unit for the first year and it was a nightmare dealing with the constant noise</text>< pics>

<text>Superb location, overall great experience, easy approval process, and excellent amenities. The gym is the best I have seen in a residential complex. The Yoga class in the sky deck brilliant idea. The leasing staff is amazing and in top of their game. Residents are courteous, and the overall maintenance an aesthetic of the building are top notch.  Easy access to all major interstate and walking distance to malls and restaurants is a super plus. To James and his leasing team, keep it up.< /text>< username>

My car got broken into twice in three months!! The second break in just happened on Saturday the 10th of April... Here’s the crazy part it wasn’t just mine it was 5-6 other vehicles. How the hell does someone break into that many cars!? I could imagine all the alarms going off and no security in sight! This place don’t even got security cameras. If they don’t get there stuff together this is jus gonna keep happening over and over again.< /Text>

<Text>This place is very unprofessional in the way in which they conduct business.
They recently towed my car, even though the car was registered to their records and there was a permit on the dashboard.
The most disappointing aspect of the situation was the lack of competence from their staff.
For about half the day I spent trying to find my car, calling parking companies and different sources, they knew where my car was but wouldn’t tell me.
The management was absent from office on a Friday so any problem had to wait until Monday. There was nobody to help provide a professional and sensical response.
Despite my frustration, I settled for a call back on Monday until someone came back to work. Well it is Thursday and that call never came.
Their lack of regard and respect for people’s time, is beyond offensive, considering they are labeled as a “luxury” apartments.
My girlfriend has had the same kind of negligence in the past. The huge construction site they have next to apartments is greatly disruptive 7 days a week. This project has been going on for almost a year and it seems not even close to being done.
My girlfriend asked to talk to the manager about her options and the same empty response was given : “I will have my manager call you back as soon as possible”.
The call never came.
The way they make their residents feel is under-appreciated to say the least.
There is a laundry list of cons I can give but perhaps I’ll write a different review to help people make informed decisions.

Lived here for a year so far. Be very careful . They will send you a move in letter showing 12 months, but once you sit down to sign the documents in fine print it will say its a 15 month lease. This place is very dirty , dog poop, Airbnb units everywhere and the pools are useless as they don't get checked for water toxicity levels, many people are getting sick from there pool and jacuzzi.<//review>

For the premium prices you pay to live in a "luxury" apartment complex, you'd certainly expect a higher degree of communication with tenants, especially during uncertain times like these. However, tenants have been consistently blindsided by management's decisions time after time. The entire complex was rebranded overnight from Millennium Mission Valley to Metro Mission Valley in the middle of a pandemic with ZERO explanation. Amenities were abruptly reopened after over 2 months of closure, but only from 9am-5pm (y'know, when most people are at work and unable to use them). Cars parked in visitor parking were broken into **inside the structure**, with no response except a new sign posted claiming no liability for stolen items. A tenant's car spontaneously burst into flames right outside some apartments without a word. Management couldn't be bothered to communicate increased safety measures or major changes by email, but is quite diligent in posting physical letters to our doors to let us know we don't qualify for rent control or that our lease is up for renewal.

I understand pandemics are out of their control, but the corporate greed and blatant lack of compassion during these trying times is disappointing to say the least. Residents continued to pay full rent prices for amenities we could not access--the pool, the sports lounge, the clubhouse, the business center, the coffee machines, the fitness center, the yoga studio--and were refused any rent credits during this time.

For those sensitive to noise, please note that ongoing construction next door has kept our apartments noisy and literally vibrating all day long.

If you're looking for a nice place to call home, I suggest you look elsewhere. You've been warned.</text>

A mismanaged property. The complex may seem safe and clean on the outside but on the inside it is poorly maintained. Theft is a major issue especially in the parking garage. The locks on the gates are consistently broken and management takes months to fix them. Gates are frequently propped open so that anyone can get into the building. Cars are regularly broken into on the property and bikes stolen from the bike storage room. Trash is often left in the hallways, causing permanent stains in the carpets that they don't bother removing. This causes the building interior to have fly infestations and it always smells like trash and mildew. If you want a place to live that's well maintained and safe, look elsewhere.<//text>

<Text>Shout out to some of the leasing staff, and the efficient and cool cats of the maintenance staff. They have been great in addressing our concerns when talking with me directly.

Unfortunately, there are too many factors at play that merit my rating. We had bugs initially when we moved in, but the fumigation by the apartment service didn't really work and the fumes lingered for much longer than what is probably healthy for a 1-year-old. We ended up buying bug traps from the department store and that solved the problem... bugs are back though (mainly ants now) and I'm sure buying more traps is an affordable and easy solution.

The construction is bothersome, and was definitely not communicated well. It's unfortunate, but with how much I'm paying for my unit (more than  $3K), it has been awful raising a family when construction wakes the household up. The shaking of the foundations and appliances went on for a good week or so too, so that was a bummer to wake up to. There is really no schedule for what to expect every morning with regard to the noise, so teleworking from home has been painful to say the least... wish I could use the business center.

The Sonder occupants rule our floor, so not being residents, they don't share the same courtesy that other residents do. Music is played loudly, there's excessive noise that must be related to a small room party (?), odors of smoked substances waft the hall outside some of their doors, and they must not be directed in how to throw away trash, because we had instances (more than once) in which our valet trash was used to throw away their food. We had pizza and ice cream once that resulted in ants outside of our door in the morning.

The elevators are conveniently inaccessible when you need them the most, and no notice is given until you find that you need to use it. Staircase doors on different floors remain locked, and some aren't at random times. It's nonsensical, but the roaming security guard says they should all be locked. They have access control proximity readers on the entrances downstairs, so I don't understand the inconvenience it takes to go to the desired floor, instead of using the appropriate door, you walk through the garage and across the way, enter the unlocked double doors and you essentially have the same access to the hallway as if you entered through the locked stair door.

Additionally, the amenities have been inaccessible due to the pandemic, but no compensation was offered or granted upon asking. They continued to clean the various amenities (community lounge(s), business center, kids playroom, gym, pool, etc.) but wouldn't even do controlled access. This has lasted for months. Now that the gym and pool are opening up, there's only guidance to maintain social distance, but even then, the other amenities are still closed off. My yearly rent will not increase, but it's obvious by shopping around online that my unit is being offered at a lower value for new sign-ups. This was the final nail in the coffin.

Anyway, it's not hard to find an equivalent place with the same amenities but with a more understanding and communicative company. Probably more affordable than what I got roped into as well.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The amenity closures were mandated by state and local governments to ensure social distancing. The closure was in no way an internal decision. The great news is that our amazing common-area amenities are now open for your use!

I have been living here for about 2 years now, and the experience was good until recently.  I experienced rat problem, vandalism on the street, multiple fire alarm mishaps, and noise problem.  In which, none of them really grind my gear since I understand that things happens outside of anyone's control.  However, since the COVID situation occur back in March, I have become intolerable to what the management company is doing.  Our amenities were shutdown unexpectedly (although I know it was government order) without communication but a cold flyer....And for the months followed, there were ZERO communication from R&V on anything while all other business have roll out their plans and good faith credits (refund on car insurance, credit card flexible reward system, fee waivers, etc.) to customers.  I can certainly understand that this has never happened before, but months without communication?
Anyway, so my friends and I decided to start a tenant association to make our voice heard, and you won't believe what happens next.  We receive strong-worded reply stating that they are just following government orders, and per signing the lease;tenants waives all claims against landlord arising out of the use of amenities, and they even refuse to simply communicate to us on any plan moving forward.  They did, however, allow a temporary rent-increase freeze that will go away once amenities open up even with restrictions... So we replied rejecting their stances but in return we got a letter from their lawyer to warn us to stop, "case closed", our client will not respond anymore, don't even try....
How is that for treating your customers?  If you don't want to share the pain by giving us some money back, that's fine, but flat out rejecting to communicate is just the worst thing you could possibly do....It's not about legality but humanity.
Reply: I never said it was your internal decision to close the amenities. I am simply stating your lack of actions in that regard.  It is your internal decision to "limit" your communication and not sympathizing.  It is actually a bit late to address the problem after your customer have decided to speak publicly.</Review>

<text>I just moved in a few months ago and it’s alright. I wouldn’t say it’s a luxurious apartment complex as the sky deck and outside locks are either nonfunctional/broken or not taken care of. I’ve let the office staff know but so far outside locks are still broken.

Beware: neighbors are THIEVES here. My rain boots were stolen from outside my apartment door a few nights ago. Now this is a rather expensive complex, so people are able to buy their own things, instead of stealing other peoples.
The complex doesn’t appear to care nor has there been any written notice about stolen property, sent to tenants.
Like the other reviews it constantly smells like weed, constant fire alarms, and music is blaring from apartments at 11pm.  No one enforces any rules here.
For the price I expected a lot more, very disappointed tenant</text>< time>

<review>The Millennium apartments are unbelievably nice. While apartment hunting here 2 weeks ago. I stopped by the millenium apartments for a tour. I didn't have an appointment, but I met Ellie and she immediately dropped what she was working on and gave me a tour of the entire building. Ellie is incredibly professional, and helpful, and she answered all of my questions. The rooms are beautiful, but the amenities REALLY sell this place. Huge pool, coffee lounge, office spaces, great gym, hot tub...etc. Stop by today and make sure you ask for Ellie!</review>< Name>

<Review>The property is aesthetically pleasing and the staff (leasing/maintenance) are very kind, but I would definitely be very cautious of moving here for the following reasons:

-Most importantly, since COVID the staff/management hasn't taken extra steps to listen and communicate with tenants.  Everyone was hit hard economically due to the outbreak, but the tenants were the ones who absorbed the cost.  It was great that staff continued to keep jobs and workers weren't laid off, but they made little attempt to creatively utilize resources to provide access to the premium amenities that were closed, although the tenants continued to pay for them.  They offered no rent concessions during this time and in my opinion, the worst part is that they refused to communicate with a tenants association and refused to communicate updates on re-opening plans, etc.  They also sent out statements to tenants stating they are exempt from the CA rent control measures.   They hid behind statements that it was due to government constraints without making attempts to proactively offer alternatives with the money we have been paying for the "premium" amenities.   They are stating in review replies that amenities are back open, but this is not accurate.  There are a few amenities that were opened on a limited capacity/limited timeframe but the majority of spaces/amenities are still closed.

-There have been a number of incidences of theft and it has significantly increased over the past few months.  Someone ran into my car in the parking unit costing me $1500 worth of damage and I was told there were no security cameras to capture the hit and run.  Through another site, the staff commented that additional security cameras have been added but this hasn't been communicated to any of the tenants.  Additionally, the bicycle storage room glass windows were smashed twice in the past few months.  Lockboxes in the garage were stolen and keys had to be replaced.   The other night a car caught on fire in the parking facility.

-Although the apartments are modern/new- the construction is poor.  You can hear stomping from upstairs neighbors and appliances are often broken.

-It is a construction zone on the west side of the complex.  We literally wake up to what feels like an earthquake shaking the room.  Dirt/dust is constantly accumulated from the construction and I can no longer enjoy sitting on the patio or anywhere outside.

This place has great potential, but sadly, many folks are planning to leave when their leases expire and I would caution others to think twice about moving here under these conditions and until things start to change and management listens and responds.</Review>< pictures>

<text>I just realized that they changed our lease term papers. We originally agreed on a 12 month and upon wanting to leave they stated i signed a 15 month term, as mentioned in other reviews they send you a move in letter with a 12 month contract , to then switch it to 15 months upon signing in fine print. Very noisy place as well.<//text><GmapID>0x80d95524e50b305d:0xe324c406b7cc2d3b< /GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate>< userid>

<Review>Notice a lot of the reviews are from people renting a few nights, not actual tenants. Living here is a terrible. The hallways are always stained with dog mess. Neighbors smoke weed indoors and leave bags of trash on the ground in the walkway to the parking garage. Management doesn't do anything to address these complaints that have been going on for nearly a year. Maintinence is not taken care of properly, some fire escape door handles have broken and rather than fix them they've just bolted cheap metal handles on. The floor/ceiling between units is paper thin, we can hear every move our upstairs neighbors make. I can never understand how the owners think this deserves to be called "luxury." A motel is more luxurious than this and less expensive! Looking forward to the day our lease ends so we can move anywhere else.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've had many positive interactions with onsite staff and maintenance over the course of my first year here, which I want to give them credit for. In truth, this place has all the potential to be a really wonderful place to live. However, primarily due to the callous way Management has handled the Covid-19 crisis and aftermath here, I have to give Metro Mission Valley (formerly Millennium Mission Valley) just one star. The amenity portfolio is vast and apartments look new. But the construction quality is very cheap and poor under the surface. Everything breaks. Appliances. Elevators. The elevator by my door was out of order for months (yes months). Full amenity access has been closed off for three months due to the pandemic and management has handled the situation so poorly from lack of communication to complete indifference that residents banded together to form a tenants association. Management responded by having its lawyers notify they'd refuse to engage in future discussions with the tenants association on the matter. Management hid behind government health regulations as a reason they will not compensate residents for paying for things they cant access, and yet a contractor entered my unit to fix my microwave (which broke a month earlier and I didn't even ask them to fix that day, I had been using a loaner for weeks and was perfectly fine with that) without wearing gloves or a mask, in violation of the County's Public Health Order. They apologized for that, but l was wiping my entire place down with makeshift disinfectant after that. It felt infuriating that they seem to hide behind "government regulations" when its convenient for them but when it actually came to enforcing them to prevent potential spread of the virus they put me at unnecessary increased risk. Either due to residents who are terrible pet owners or the large number of AirBnb guests who stay here and don't treat our community with the respect a home deserves, there is dog poop and urine EVERYWHERE in the parking garage. You really have to watch your step in there, and in the stairwells, and in the hallways. Really gross. For these reasons, and primarily because R and V Management thinks of and treats its residents so poorly, I have to give one star.</Review>

< review>
R&V Management is the problem.
PREMIUM AMENTITIES NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

Moving to Metro Mission Valley apartments, or Millennium Mission Valley as it was known last December was a no brainer. Mission Valley is 15 minutes from everywhere, lots of great restaurants and shopping and a pretty scenic river walk. The building and staff have always been great and the PREMIUM AMENTITIES were hard to pass up. Great lounge areas, pool, and 2 floor weight room, and countless other places to hang, relax, and meet neighbors.

After the onset of COVID 19 , states, business, and apartments made necessary and well timed changes to common areas and amenities and Metro Mission Valley was no different. The staff have remained on hand and continue to be professional, courteous, and great and I’m glad that our rent continues to ensure these great people have jobs and security.

However the similarities to surrounding apartments stopped there. R&V Management was mum to address concerns of timing or providing information concerning the opening of common areas we all pay for. It was only after a group of neighbors organized into a tenet association that management bothered to respond to questions. To make matters worse, R&V Management has refused to meet tenets requests in providing any concessions to help our neighbors or reward tenet loyalty, either with rent credits or rent increase freezes. Instead R&V Management has shut down dialogue and further inquiry with responses from their lawyers, leaving PREMIUM AMENITIES unused, and still very much paid for. It is unacceptable that R&V Management continues to ignore established tenets concerns and help lighten the load of a burden that has taken a costly toll on the community at large.

For NEW AND PROSPECTIVE TENETS, you should be aware of R&V Managements inability to be flexible or empathetic, especially in the context of a pandemic that IS showing signs of a second round of infections and possible shutdowns. Great introductory prices for PREMIUM AMENITIES sounds too good to be true. And it is.< /review>

<Text>Updated Review: The management has recently turned a bunch of the units into an Airbnb. This means that there are constantly random people here who are on vacation, party all night and do not care about the community rules. I would not recommend it. If you want to live in a hotel with random people, this is your place.

Original Review: Generally a good experience.  There is room for improvement, especially in the enforcement of community rules. Also, the building is not built very well.   However, the location is great, close to everything.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I am so happy with my decision to move to the Millennium. My studio apartment is well designed to be space-efficient and the finished are high quality. It's pretty quiet at night and I appreciate having a view of the landscaping. The community spaces are beautiful and well kept. I see staff cleaning every day and they are always spotless. I appreciate having the office space available; and I love the yoga room and they sky deck! The staff here is also outstanding. The maintenance team responds to requests immediately (within a few hours!) Edgar, the maintenance manager, does an excellent job to investigate the issue and ensure it is completely resolved. Seth, Krystal, Jensine, and Brad in the leasing office are all super friendly and helpful. I moved from out of state and they have gone out of their way to accommodate me and help me acclimate the the new area. Everyone goes above and beyond!!

<text>The complex is new and the amenities are fairly nice.  The staff are kind as well.  When I moved in, it seemed like a neat, modern place for working professionals and small families.  However, I would no longer recommend this place as a home.  A large portion of the building has been turned into an air bnb of sorts, so it feels more like a hotel than a home.  Rotating noisy neighbors who are always on vacation means the amenities are often overused and full, and community rules are not followed.  My hall smells like weed most nights, and today there was feces in the hall.  Not sure if it's human or animal. I understand apartment living means some sacrifice, but I definitely didn't want to live in a hotel.< /text><Name>Mark O<//Name>< Response>

<review>I'm not sure why this place is called a "luxury" apartment complex. A non "luxury" apartment would most likely been built a whole lot better.

Our new apartment has been ridden with nothing but issues, I'll name just a few...

The kitchen trim, under the counters has completely fallen down, almost like it wasn't glued properly.

The toilet paper dispenser in our bathroom never even fit, the roll immediately falls down because the metal holders were drilled too far apart.

The shower curtain metal bar was cut wrong and has a ridge in the middle so it is a pain to open and close the curtains.

The ceilings are paper thin and you can hear everything  the upstairs neighbors are doing.

I found a used syringe on the entrance to the trash chute room.

The hallways reek of weed 24/7.

Our a/c does not flow into the master bedroom, at all, even though it clearly has a vent.

AirBnb guests are a good chunk of your neighbors nowadays.

Packages are stolen from right in front of your door.

Gym and amenities are full of hotel AirBnb guests at all times.

All of this, and this new company is more concerned with towing residents cars, which they know beforehand belongs to a resident, when towing your car. Guess you got to fund the "luxury" apartment with a Western Towing partnership, yeah?

Place is the epitome of luxury. :)< /review></record>

I recently moved in to the Millenium Mission Valley. The onsite team Seth, Allisa and Ellie were all very helpful through the leasing process.

Location and amenities are great too!
Property is very clean and well maintained.

Update:

After one year I still have no complaints, property is well kept and the office and maintenance staff are very responsive.< /text>

The best place l have ever rented from.

l have lived in apartments that have claimed to be luxury but none have lived up to being "luxury", until this one. Some of the things that drew me in were the amenities like the pool area, the onsite BBQ grills, complimentary coffee machines, common areas with billiards, large flatscreens, and game cabinet. The apartments are amazing with beautiful dark cabinets and complementary stainless steel appliances. In apartment washers and dryers may have been the thing that sold me on this apartment.

I am within walking distance to a Trader Joes, two malls with movie theaters, and great restaurants. Access to the interstate is fast, I can be on l-8 in under a minute most mornings. The community is quiet and I forget that it is next to the Interstate when sitting outside.

This is a great place to live in San Diego.</Review>

Originally I had posted a 1 star review due to the Air bnb visitors.  My truck was also broken into, but the team here at millennium dropped a lot of the Air bnb visitors and the break in and theft issue has definitely decreased.  I haven't heard of any new issues. I want to thank the millenium for solving this issue!<//Text>

(Will edit with more information as we start longer )So far, from our experience with have dealt with nothing but friendliness, and willingness to accommodate us by every single member apart of the staff. The units themselves are absolutely wonderful, and in my opinion really live up to their value. The location of the complex is absolutely perfect if you are looking for a central location within walking distance of EVERYTHING in Mission Valley, and within distance of the trolly system so essentially all of San Diego. The amenities, like the heated pool and amazing 2-level fitness center, make this an absolute "must consider "<//text>

New complex in the heart of mission valley. We went in for a showing and were super impressed. Highlights:
The gym is amazing
The business center is more than a few sad PCs. As a professional, I can actually use this area and the private meeting rooms are perfect for small meetings.
The roof fav was super cute with a nice view.
The apartments were a great size.
The staff was super helpful.
Love the big parking structure.
Downside
Mission valley gets busy but you can take the back way to the 8 via hotel circle and the proximity to shopping is dangerous for me!

It is at the top of my price range but it literally has EVERYTHING! And of course Trader Joe’s shake shack and fashion valley. Need I say more. Worth consideration.<//Text>

<review>There are constantly alarms going off and is difficult to work, sleep, etc and they do not have anyone on staff address these issues in a timely manner.  A smoke alarm constantly sounded for 16 hours and within that timeframe after the fire department and police were on site, the management company didn't send anyone to fix the issues.  They spent 3 full days sounding fire alarms all day due to testing.  There is currently another alarm that has been sounding for hours and they haven't resolved the issue.  This is becoming a recurrent issue and then they don't answer your calls when you call to report the issues.

Additionally, although the building is new, you can hear the upstairs neighbors stomping around.   My license plate was stolen from my motorcycle within the gated garage and they didn't have security footage of that area of the garage.  The gated doors and locks are consistently broken.   There are constantly visitors from Airbnb in the common areas.   Unfortunately, many of the amenities that used to be offered have been taken away since I moved in.    The wifi is often not working in the business lounge, which makes it difficult to work from home.

It is a beautiful property and the leasing agents are kind, but I really wish that the management would address these issues so that we could really enjoy living here.<//review>< pictures>

Luxury apartments... not exactly. The apartment complex has pretty good amenities but you pay a price, not only in rent but also in what you have to put up with. There is constantly trash that is in the hallway as well as in the trash shoot that leads out to the garage. Nothing like coming home from work to a pile of trash-am I right? The millennium also has an issue with security. They have locks on outdoor entrances but they are not always locked. There is also a gated garage but there is usually a 50/50 chance that it is stuck wide open for anyone to come in to the garage. In less than a year I have been here, there have been multiple burglaries that have occurred in the “secure” garage- myself being a victim. When I went to call the front desk no one was there. Also I found out through the news not the leasing office that a resident at the millennium mission valley was robbed at gunpoint. Our peace of mind is gone despite their efforts to “increase security”. I did suggest cameras in the garage, which they waved off stating they were going to have two security guards for one day. Will that help in the future? No.

Long story short, look up the multiple police reports here and do some research before you move into luxury.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1556132156671, 'text': 'Nate, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about your experience at The Millennium Mission Valley. I am sorry to hear that you have been impacted by a vehicle break in.\nThe first thing that I would like to do is to invite you to sit down with me personally to discuss the issues that you have been experiencing as this is the first that I have heard from your household about your concerns. If there are any locks that are not operable, we will address the issue immediately. I entered a service request when I read your comment for our maintenance team to do an additional inspection on the exterior doors as we do not have any reports of a malfunctioning lock at this time.\nRegarding our increase in our security patrol, we did not increase the patrols  for only one day and I am sorry if there was a miscommunication about what steps we have taken. I would be happy to discuss some of the specifics with you personally. The one step that we need your support in is to make sure that your doors are locked and that items of value are not left in plain sight inside of your vehicle. This is the same message that we sent to you in our November 22nd 2018 letter regarding personal safety.\nRegarding the garage gate, we have only had 1 incident since our opening of the gate being in the open position due to a mechanical issue, and we were able to resolve the issue the same day. If there are other times that the gate is malfunctioning, I would like to hear about it as I have not seen this nor has it been reported to us at any point in time.\nRegarding the incident from March 2019 involving an alleged robbery, we sent an email to each and every resident on 3/22/2019 after we gathered details from the law enforcement agencies involved. The news story aired before the incident was reported to us and before our office was open in the morning following the incident.\nAgain, I thank you for sharing your thoughts about your experience at The Millennium Mission Valley and I encourage you to reach out about setting up a time to discuss your concerns with me directly.\n\nSeth Springman\nCommunity Manager'}<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Me and my wife have been living here for almost two years. Everything was great until the new management took over a year ago. Half of the apartment units are Air bnb’s, the hallways reek of weed every night and day. There are dogs who bark constantly non stop on like a 24/hour rotation. There have been several times where sketchy people have been scene around the area. I found some guy literally parked right next to my car one night. He brought up something off topic as I walked up to my car. Something to do about my parking pass. But he did not look like any reliant employee that I’ve seen. (reliant is the parking management)

The hallways are covered in stains, about three months ago my wife found a used needle near the trash room. My packages constantly went missing, and when I told the staff they informed me that they do not have any surveillance on the property... not to mention there was a robbery at gun point here not too long ago...security literally did nothing to stop it. The doors here that supposed to be locked are falling apart. The fixtures are not even installed properly, the trim literally fell over in the kitchen as if it wasn’t even attached...

I am so ready to get the hell out of here.</Review>< Pictures>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Moving to the Millennium  early June, I found that this complex had more than I ever expected for a simple renters digression. Not only does it have gated garage parking, it also has laundry in unit which is a must have deal breaker for me. I'm an ICU nurse and need to be as clean as possible.  The residents are very welcoming, and I even managed to find a couple more medical professionals living here. The whirlpool other pool make for a nice relaxing day along with the new grills and fire pit for a night time of relaxing and making s'mores. It felt like I virtually had no neighbors because the extrinsic sounds were very muddled. Mind you as well, these are luxury apartments and the building is filled with amazing amenities: two story weight room with yoga studio, common area with a pool table full kitchen and two 70 inch TVs, and an aqua patio!  My studio was brand new, cleaned, and filled with stainless appliances. I found this place while living in San Francisco and completely booked in online without setting foot on the premises. The leasing management are so nice and assertive when it comes to asking questions or for assistance with the apartments. They were helpful 100% of the time and I wish And hope I stay as long As possible. I will be coming back here given another opportunity if I have to move away.  I definitely enjoyed the time being. Thank you Millennium and especially Amber and Jensine for taking care of me and my high maintenance self.</text>< date>

<rate>5</rate><text>The staff here is mostly outstanding, especially Seth Springman & Brad Holmes & they have been the best Community Managers/Leasing Professionals I have ever dealt with, & are exceptionally responsive. I also love the location as you can get to any place you want in the San Diego area in about 20 minutes or less due to it’s central location & proximity to the highway. Also the community is still pretty quiet.The maintenance team responds to requests immediately (within a few hours!) Edgar, the maintenance manager, does an excellent job to investigate the issue & ensure it is completely resolved.
This is a luxury apartment complex has some pretty great community amenities such as a Sky Deck, Resort-style Pool w/ Poolside BBQs, Large Business Center w/ Individual Work Spaces, Sports Bar & Lounge w/ TVs, Resident VIP Lounge,  2-story Fitness Center w/ Treadmills, Elliptical & Rowing Machines, Yoga & Spin Room, Wi-Fi Lounge w/ Gourmet Coffee Bar, On-site retail space including Shake Shack, Shuttle Services, Automated Parcel System, & a gated fob entry Parking Garage which includes 1 free permit per Unit & only costs $50 for each additional permit. Since the opening of the complex there has only been 1 incident of the gate being stuck in the open position due to a mechanical issue, but management ensured this was quickly resolved later the same day. The apartments are nice luxury studio, 1, & 2 bedroom units including some Townhomes & live/work units being available. The units have tall spacious Dark/Espresso Cabinets & light gray/white Quartz Countertops, Vinyl Wood-style Flooring, GE Stainless Steel Appliances (dishwasher, refrigerator w/ filtered water & ice maker, Electronic Apartment Entry Locks, Gas Ranges, Under-cabinet Lighting, Oversized tubs, Upgraded Lighting in Some Units, Open Kitchen Plan w/ Islands in Some Units. The Pet Amenities offered includes a Fenced-in pet park, Waste stations to keep the community clean, & Complimentary treats in leasing.
As mentioned by a fellow resident there have been a few occasions of trash in the hallway as well as in the 2nd floor trash room that leads out to the garage due to a few tenants and/or Sonder/Corporate Rental customers not disposing of their trash properly. It is not management at fault, this is due to a few lazy &/or entitled-feeling tenants. As well as having cleaning staff on hand every day, Management ensures things are spotless while cleaning staff are here to assist in resolving any issues/messes made overnight by the few disrespectful people here & also continually puts out community wide e-mails to curb this as best they can.
There is also on-site security. The building has locks on all outdoor entrances, when there have been anything not operable or any other issues, management has addressed this immediately once made aware in my personal experience. Also, any tenant can enter a service request for maintenance to do any additional inspections.
Like another tenant review mentioned, in the first portion of the year of being here, there had been multiple burglaries that had occurred in the “secure” garage- myself & my boyfriend being victims (Aug & Nov 2018)
Management has also done their best to ensure our safety by changing security companies to Bald Eagle Security, posted a guard at the gated garage, & put other measures in place that have helped to DRASTICALLY DECREASE the Frequency/Amount of issues since early November 2018. This is this type & increasing amount of crime isn’t unique to this complex & has been on the uptick in all of Mission Valley/San Diego even in ‘nicer’ areas.
All in all the staff has been excellent, have been more than helpful when there has been an issue & has continued to help make our community better when possible. This has been my favorite place at which I have rented & I renewed my lease recently.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

They marked my package as delivered but it was obviously not delivered. I was home all day, I live in a building complex that has 24/7 front desk. It was a 77 lbs package that they claim they handed to the 'customer', but the package was never dropped off. My building even has security cameras to prove.

You can read the other comments and see that this center is pretty much running a scam and FedEx does not care.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Fedex is Absolutely the worst business. I tried to call and talk to the 800 number where they told me there are no available supervisors from now thru the holidays and they had no clue if my package was on a truck like it said or in the ground location. After 4 days of it saying it was on a truck I finally went to the ground location. It took me over 30 minutes for them to find the package they told me was not there and was on a truck. While I was waiting for them to find the package I saw 8-10 employees coming and going with no masks. So yes if I could I would give FedEx -5 stars but 1 is all I can here.< /text></record>

A FedEx driver called me in the morning of Thursday, April 1st asking if I wanted my package to be delivered that day. I've never gotten any phone calls prior to this instance about wanting a package delivered, so I was slightly confused but said "yes of course". I wonder what would have happened I didn't answer my phone by chance.

Following that day I get "Delivery exception
Future delivery requested" on my package status.
I live in an apartment building with front desk people 24/7 who sign packages for you so not having someone there isn't possible. The next day they said they will deliver on Monday, today, April 5th.
After waiting all day today for my $800 item I saw that my package suddenly lost any trace of information online so I attempted to contact and call Fedex. After going through automated chatting options online and on the phone that didn't help, I finally got ahold of someone who took my tracking number, name, and address JUST to transfer me to someone else who took my information all over again. The second representative was more helpful but I still have no idea when my package will arrive. They will supposedly contact me when they will attempt to deliver again. I made multiple plans with the item I ordered that will directly affect my networking and income and this is thoroughly disappointing.<//text>

I never received the package that they supposedly delivered to my front door on 11/22/20. I was home all day. Their customer service in tracking this package is terrible. They provide No Help in locating the package nor do they get back to you with a human person... only texting your phone. I never once had this problem with their competitors: US Postal Service or UPS.<//Text>

The worst delivery business compares to their competitor. If tracking showed package on delivery truck out for delivery, just deliver the package on the same day. Why goes back to the facility and deliver 2 days later? This happened to me for last 3 deliveries consecutively. Why???<//Review>

<Review>Frequently don’t receive packages when the tracking information states it was loaded on a truck for delivery, just for it to be updated at the end of the day stating a new delivery date several days in the future, even when packages have arrived at this local facility. Such a joke. DHL and UPS are far more reliable.</Review>< pics>

<text>On numerous occasions, FedEx claimed to make a drop off and made no attempt at contacting the security desk at my office building when they were not there (number posted in case they step away); further claiming that no one was available. I’m here everyday and called customer support and gave my number to call when they arrived. Never received a call. Called about 7 times for one package and never got any follow up. Terrible customer service.< /text>< Response>

< Review>
Because of COVID we are home all the time. But yesterday FedEx decided to NOT call us from the call box to get access into the building. It was easier for them to put a 'we missed you' door tag and try again even though we were home! And AGAIN today, same story, they didn't buzz to get entry into the building. And put a door tag! Are they thinking we will wait in the front entrance of our apartment? This is the worst customer service ever. I run an ecommerce business and use UPS and USPS and this is why we never use FedEx. Perhaps it's just this one driver, but the customer service will not even help me! Very frustrating.<//Review>

For over 32 years in business, I have never seen such a horrible, poor & unprofessional service as I see with FedEx Ground service in my area.
The drivers don't speak a word of English. They leave my packages in the driveway ,  not anywhere that I can see it them. Bad company, I cannot believe they are still in business.</text>

Absolutely the worst delivery in Bay Area. They leave packages in front of the door while someone is waiting at the house and all they have to do is ring the door. They’ve kept my package with “delivery exception” for four days now. It’s absolutely the worst.<//review>

<review>I was waiting for my backpack for 3 whole days. It is not even a big or heavy package!! I live in an apartment, and maybe that’s why the driver is too lazy to find the apartment?? Then I try to save them some time and have a delivery instruction saying that they can leave at the leasing office, someone can sign for it. They didn’t even do that!! Just keep saying that they attempted to deliver it. I mean what the heck are you talking about?!?! Can Fedex hire someone that’s reliable please?!?!</review>< response>

FedEx ground at 1070 San Mateo Ave. is the WORST. This is the first and last time I’ll be using their service. I left probably 10 voicemails and nobody is returning my call whatsoever. I suppose to receive package on 4/6 and now is 4/18 and no action has been done. Then, at some point I went to there location to pick up the package and guess what the can’t find it and after waiting for an hour I left. The guy named Greg told me that they will find it and ship it tomorrow to my address first thing next morning, I waited 5 days and still no package. Start calling again and leaving the voicemails, still no callback. But, here is the best part: this morning I received a text saying that since package wasn’t PICKED UP in time they are sending back to sender. THEY ARE THE WORST!   And now I don’t know what to do, I still don’t have my package!!!!</review>

They randomly stopped delivering packages to my building. Came here to clear up the situation, noone could explain the problem to me, packages ended up being returned to sender. A huge problem since they were critical parts for repairs.</text>

< Review>
Stayed home on multiple days expecting a package. Of course, they didn't arrive.
One of the nights, I refreshed at night to see if there were any updates - 10:58 pm SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, CA
Delivery exception
Customer not available or business closed

What the heck! I asked you to call or text me when you get here, there's no door person at my complex, and even if there were, they wouldn't be working this late!
Why did I bother paying for appointment delivery if you can't even deliver on the same day, much less at the appointment time?< /Review>

<Review>They are awful I called on Tuesday to have my package held they did not Hold it instead I did not receive my package at all. When they finally did hold it it wasn’t ready until Friday and I had a business meeting on Wednesday. Then when you look up the address it doesn’t show which location in South San Francisco so now I have to wait till Monday to get my package the worst service ever all the time<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<date>1567731163867</date><rating>1</rating><Text>Just like several other reviewers on here, I stayed home to receive my package, which was about 50 pounds. However, the driver not even knocked my door and when I checked the package’s status online, it said that they attempted delivery while they clearly didn’t. I understand this package might have been heavy for the driver but if he/she cannot do the job properly then why is he/she still working?

After a few “delivery attempts”, I decided to bite the bullet and came to this facility to pick up the package myself. BUT, I had to wait over 40 minutes for them to give it to me. From now on, when purchasing anything online, I will explicitly ask the seller NOT to ship it with FedEx.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f79c935d7fe65:0x18bbeb2c8f3c0ac4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just a bunch of lazy guys going about wasting their time. I lost important documents here! They don't even bother scanning the package so that we know where it is. Even FedEx customer service knew that, "oh, it went to this facility? They never pick up our calls and always lose packages". And exactly like that, nobody knew where my package was, because scanners are too much work for them. DO NOT USE FEDEX!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>After waiting for my table for 3 days after the expected delivery date I called and they told me it would take another 2 days because of the weekend and wouldn’t even confirm that I would get it by Monday. I told them that I would go to the facility to pick the table myself and NOT TO LOAD IT so I could pick it up. And when I showed up they told me that they loaded it and couldn’t get it from the trailer. They didn’t even look for it. Not I have to PRAY that it gets delivered by Monday and I have to host a dinner party with no table. No solution, nothing.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I had no idea how incompetent FedEx Ground is until my recent experience. Unfortunately it's similar to what others have posted here. TL;DR: Don't bother trying to pick up in person from here, it will likely fail.

Here's the whole story:
1. It took a week to deliver a package from this delivery terminal to San Francisco.
2. Despite days-long exceptions, no-one investigated proactively. They relied me as the recipient to alert them about issues.
3. They never actually could tell where the package actually is – the tracking did not reflect reality.
4. Inquiring about the actual location and status of a package takes 24-48 hours – and doesn't yield any results; they will not call you.
5. Customer support cannot reach a delivery terminal directly but has to leave a voice message.
6. When trying to pick up the package from the delivery terminal in person, the staff claimed the package was not there and the tracking code invalid – both were not true.
7. They delivered the item in the afternoon of the next day – after the merchant had cancelled delivery/turned it around the night before.
8. Then they delivered a second package from the merchant that had been turned around 2 days before, gained access to my apartment building despite my explicit wish to refuse the delivery, and dumped it in the building lobby without the required signature.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808f79c935d7fe65:0x18bbeb2c8f3c0ac4<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

Apparently, the driver attempted to deliver a package 3 times, never leaving a door tag. This package didn’t require a signature, so he could have left it in the apartment building as has happened with every other package but he failed to do so. The company was not accommodating and said I would get a call to pick up at the SSF location. At 5:45 I called to see why I hadn’t been contacted and they said the location closes at 6 and the driver probably wasn’t even back yet as he has until 8. So I got stuck dealing with his failures negatively affecting me and my job.</Text>

<text>I work from home, and my desk is five feet from my front door. Day 1: Got a door tag but no knock. Day 2: Left a note asking for them to knock, saying I'm home. No knock. Second door tag. Day 3: My husband stays home from work and waits on our couch, 6 feet from the front door, which he leaves OPEN. He hears someone come halfway up the stairs and then it goes quiet. An hour later, he checks the status on the package and sees that another failed delivery attempt was logged at the time that he heard the driver. The driver had come halfway up the stairs, noticed that the door was open, turned around and left. The driver then had the nerve to log a door tag into the system, which he did not leave on our door because he refused to approach it. All this because it was a big package and he didn't want to deal with it. I have never recommended firing someone, until now.

Horrible delivery service. Management needs to fix this. Package left Sacramento Wednesday morning. Didn’t get scanned into South SF until 26 hours later. Was out for delivery Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday but never delivered. They claimed bad weather on both Thursday and Sunday., no excuse for Friday and that we weren’t home on Saturday. None of which were valid. Even phone calls to customer service did me no good. I don’t think this office understands that the “Ex” in FedEx stands for “Express”. I’ve told the shipper they should get their money back< /review>

ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!!!
I shipped a package “2 Day Shipping” 8 days later my package has NOT been delivered. The website keeps updating to “restriction, no delivery attempted” or “Will Deliver Tomorrow” And EVERYDAY it indicates “On FedEx truck for delivery”
I’ve called EVERY DAY trying to sort out what’s  happened to my package, but nobody even seems to know WHERE my package is! It’s not small. It weights almost 50lbs. A little hard to lose.
I shipped early to avoid the Christmas rush and still can’t get a pack to arrive on time???
Come on FedEx. There’s CLEARLY NO ONE from FedEx reading all the 1 star reviews.
The service center can’t even get these guys to respond to complaints, let alone ANSWER THE PHONE!</Text>

This is the second delivery in two weeks that Fedex has left downstairs by the mailboxes, rather than leaving it by my door.  I live on a busy street, with people walking by all day long.  The packages were left out in the open in the driveway. FedEx has no problem blocking my driveway, but they can’t bring the packages to my door?

Someone is highly overpaid and not doing their job.< /text>

The worst customer service!!!

FedEx ground doesn’t deliver late in San Francisco. I guess they expect everyone to work from home or got rich from a VC venture because all drivers vacate the city by 3:30 pm. Then on top of that there’s no pick up site in San Francisco. If you drive to the South San Francisco. Which on a good day is about 30 minutes away by car without traffic. The FedEx ground facility isn’t even a customer service place. You have talk to a security guard and write down your tracking number. FedEx Ground is just about the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. I will be making no one who uses FedEx to never ship using FedEx ground.

FedEx Ground has to be more accountable and accommodating to the recipient customers. I have had such a bad experience I’m reporting this to the BBB.<//text>

I can share some of previous recessions. The driver who should deliver my package didn't take time to ring the bell and at least try to deliver the package! Instead, he just tagged the sheet at my door, although I was at home waiting for my package. Worst service I've ever experienced! Maybe the management of this place should rebrief their drivers! Come on guys, it's your f****** job to deliver the package, just do it!</review>

My package is 2 weeks late and still not delivered. I've had to call them 6 times already. The lack of empathy and concern from the agents on the phone has been staggering. If I could give 0 stars, I would.< /Review>

< Review>
Being one of the most expensive services available one would assume a certain level of competence would be evident. I was promised my package on a Wednesday of no determined specific window of time ( this means I have my day hijacked until they decide to deliver). By late that evening I checked the tracking number again only to be told that no estimate of delivery is determined. Even later they finally decide (once my entire day has been thrown away by this situation) to promise Thursday delivery. I patiently wait until the same status updates appear. Knowing that my package was at the nearest ground delivery center since 2am the previous day I am now seeing that this is not a one time mistake, these things happen but now I feel like it's a problem that the company has with doing it's job effectively.  I call because I don't have time to waste and this package is important for something I have to present by monday morning for finals. I am told that I will be contacted by FedEx the next morning confirming some manageable ETA. The call never comes and to make it worse now the status update tells me that the package I have wasted 3 days waiting for in vane is now not expected to be delivered until some undetermined time Monday! I cannot except this type of treatment even from the cheapest service available so to know that FedEx being pricier than the other companies treats my time like this is a pure insult and a disgusting display of what I see as a disrespectful lack of integrity. The only number provided by FedEx puts me in contact with someone who has no control or influence on the status of my package. My complaints need to be heard by someone who is in charge and honestly, the only honorable action at this point to redeem this behavior is if a manager from the local shipping center hand delivered my package before the sun goes down today! It costs me $15 and 2.5-3 hours of my time to go to san Francisco and pick this up. I have let your company spit in my face in regard to time and your service is too costly as it is for me to do this and let it be okay. I will do everything in my power from here on out to not only avoid your service but also make sure that other people don't end up being taken advantage of or lead on by your lack of professionalism and disregard for the customers time and money<//Review>

Can't pin bad on all FedEx Ground Drivers / Dept. But as soon as my package got to CA it took an extra week before I said , ENOUGH!!!!!  THE PACKAGE WAS ON THEIR TRUCK THE WHOLE TIME AND THEY NEVER TRIED TO DELIVER IT.
I had to go out of my way to get it at the SSF location where the truck return after the day is over. The guy at the Customer Service Greg was very professional and helpful to recover my package the next day.
This STAR is for Greg wish I could give him More but I've done too much already.
Wal-mart uses Fed-Ex Ground to deliver their goods, this is not the first time Fed-Ex delivery was a fail.
Poor Management leads to poor work ethics.</Review>

After my package was already a week late, I finally called FedEx to pickup the package myself. Prior to Ubering to this location I called FedEx to ensure it’s  availability for pickup. The operator informed me it 100% be ready until they closed at 4pm. This was false and a waste of $30 in Uber fees. I arrive at 10am only to find out its “impossible” to grab my package from a truck which is on the premise. Impression I got from their employee was that they’re just lazy. The QA person at the warehouse told me their operators only want to get off the phone quickly and provide poor customer service. He was correct in that statement, but also provided poor customer service himself. On top of a package being a week late, I’m now out $60 in Uber fees.

They could only guarantee me it would arrive on Monday. If that’s the case, then why didn’t it arrive on time?</Review>

I know of at least one driver that works out of here lies...  Caught them in video not not attempting to deliver package.  Just walked up, slapped the “not available” sticker on the lobby door.  Too lazy to come in and take elevator.  If he lies about this, no telling what else he lies about while on his route.

FedEx, UPS has no problem performing the bare minimum of at least attempting to deliver package.</Text>

I can’t believe how frustrating the drivrs are. The package is 71 lbs furniture box. I was waiting at home all day to get it delivered but the driver noted that “customer unavailable”. He didn’t even leave any door tag to prove that he attempted. Then second day, same thing “customer unavailable” even though I was waiting for him all day. So I called customer service and complained. I gave them the gate code since it’s gated condos incase he gave the excuse of being unable to get in. Third day, I was expecting that he will actually deliver it because I talked to customer service and complained. Unbelievably, he lied again and claimed he attempted to deliver at 1:07pm and “customer available”.  I saw that online message 10mins after and so frustrated. I had been checking all cars coming in and out the gate cos I was given time frame for estimated delivery from customer service representative. Eventually, I gave up and decided to pick it up. The moral of the story is “FEDEX DRIVERS NEVER BOTHER TO DELIVER HEAVY PACKAGES!” This is the last time dealing with FedEx and I’ll tell my vendors to always use UPS.</text>

<Text>Package was too big for me to pick up. Tracking said delivery would happen the next business day and nothing happened for about two weeks during which someone had to stay home. I called at least 5 times. Either no one picked up, or they said they'd deliver the next day and didnt or said they didnt know when they can deliver it. Only after contacting the seller on Ebay who talked to them they finally delivered. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Worst Ever!!! First delivery said would be delivered last Friday...took the day off from work to be sure someone was home for them to deliver to door and the packages never came..next scheduled for Tuesday...came home Monday and they had thrown two 100# boxes with chairs in them over my gate into my landscaping and busted the chairs!! Re-ordered chairs with specific delivery date for someone to be home (next Tuesday) reassures three times they would get delivered on TUESDAY come home today and there are two boxes 100# each left in front of the gate on the street side in front of the basement apartment! So now I have two busted up boxes in my landscaping waiting for retrieval and two others at the wrong door and I have a bad back and can’t lift!!!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>I placed an order for a new mattress (compressed in a box weighing 85 lbs) through Amazon that was supposed to be delivered on a Thursday via FedEx ground. Per the amazon shipping notifications the package was riding around on a truck alllll Thursday without being delivered. I received notification that the package was back at the warehouse and couldn't be delivered for an unknown reason. I called the 800 and was advised that my mattress would be delivered on Fri. I checked the website Fri morning to ensure that my package was out for delivery... guess what??? It hadn't been scanned and showed as still sitting in the warehouse. I called the 800 and was told that the tracking website isn't always updated and that she saw that my package was on a truck and out for delivery, Flash forward to Friday night... still no package. I call again and an investigation has now been opened so they can tell why it still hasn't been delivered. Within a 1/2 hour I receive a call from Lisa who says she spoke with a station agent who didn't know why my package hadn't been placed on a truck but guaranteed it would be delivered on Monday. It is now Monday..... still no mattress. I called again and was actually transferred to the location because  the station agent advised that they could not locate my package in the warehouse.... OMFG How in the entire F do you lose an 85lb box????? I proceeded to ask Mary Ann this exact question. She advised that since she was talking to me she was unable to go and look for it, and that once she got off the phone with me, and it was found I could come and pick it up. Are you F'ING serious. I told her I want it delivered and asked that my phone be given to a supervisor and that I can be called once it is out for delivery. She was completely unprofessional and clearly FedEx ground is an unorganized mess.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If zero rating  is an option i would do so- they were suppose to deliver on Saturday - driver lied and said he attempted but we are unavailable then they said Monday - when we called they said that was a mistake they dont deliver mondays.. they have holiday - Guaranteed Tuesday - today again and when i called they said no it will have to be tomorrow and that they didnt have an explanation... customer service agent says they won't help because that's the service we choose.. but we didnt the amazon seller choose and i have no control... Well best help she can give is let the delivery fail 3 times and we can collect it🤣... was like.. I waited more than a week. To get it delivered...Then week for you to fail...And then you may provide me the contact details of the transit office... What a pathetic service by fedex... WTH..<//Text>

< Review>
Each day the package was supposed to come. Each day I called to ensure that they had the right directions. Each day the package is promised to come by EOD. Each day that changes to the next day. Insanely frustrating waste of time.< /Review>

<Review>This place is so unprofessional I can’t believe  the people that that they hire to deliver for them I took off work to receive my package I was home all day they made no delivery attempt even tho the driver said he did seems to be very common with this facility this place is a joke someone should really do something to hold the drivers accountable so this stops.<//Review>< pictures>

The worst service I’ve ever encounter in my life. All my packages from FedEx is late. Not just one or two days, now its been 4 days and counting. I’ll never do business with fedex again, I really hope this business close very soon.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I don't understand why there is a FedEx delivery point near my home. They want to put my parcel here and notify me to take it. (At this time, four days have passed since they failed to send. I am not at home. This ghost place is 16 kilometers from the apartment I live in.

After diagnosing the issue, it was quoted immediately, fixed quickly - and still came in under the estimate!  The inspection was thorough, and the explanation was professional and easy to understand.

<review>I was really waiting for the hard / up sale with a mile long list of things  that were wrong  but what we got instead was a pleasant explanation of things that Romeo found and how he could take care of them.  He was quick and efficient.  You could tell he took great pride in his job.  He wore his mask and shoe coverings each time he entered our home.

I signed up for the package inspection while shopping at lowes and am I glad I did.

Thanks so much,

Robert and Loretta< /review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Timo’s service from start to finish was top notch. From the project manager to the skilled technicians, this team is the most professional we have ever had the pleasure of doing business with. They kept us informed of all steps in the installation process and their follow up has been exceptional. I would HIGHLY recommend Timo’s to everyone looking for not just standard expectations but the highest expectations and quality  expected.<//Review>

Starting with a recommendation from a neighbor, we had Timo’s come out to give us a quote for putting air conditioning splits in our two car garage and our golf cart garage. Overall the bid was reasonable and the guys came within a week to do the install. They quickly found out that it was not going to be as easy as they originally envisioned. This led to a significant workaround that basically tripled the amount of time it took as well as the materials. However, they never deviated from the quoted price! The install guys stuck with it, were very friendly, and knowledgeable about the installation and the products. Overall, we are very happy with the outcome!<//Text>

<review>Timo’s is the best in the valley!!! They installed my unit and continue to maintain it. They perform summer & winter preventative maintenance. The office staff & their service men are professional and through. They wear booties over their shoes to protect the interior of my home, big plus in my book. You’ll be very pleased with any service they perform for you.<//review>< Time>

< review>
I wanted a second opinion on a needed AC repair. Their opinion agreed with that of the first company, establishing both companies as reputable in my mind. Timo's gave me a great deal more information than the first company and I was able to make a well-informed decision to replace rather than to repair the 30 year old system. I would have chosen Timo's even for the less expensive repair but my spouse suffers from COPD and I recognized the system replacement as the healthier alternative. Their work was of superlative quality and they included
many extra things beyond their contractual requirements.</review>

<Text>Incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, clean, professional, personable, and friendly. So very pleased with Timo's. This is my first time dealing with them but it definitely won't be the last.

<text>Last year we had Timo’s install two new AC units to replace our old ones and they did a great job. Today we had them out for our free maintenance on them. Our technician Chris was on time and very professional and efficient !  He did a great job cleaning everything and replacing the filters as well as explaining what he did today and his recommendations for the future. I think we chose the best company for our Air Conditioners. Thank you Timo’s !< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>We hired Timo’s to replace a 16yr. Old unit. From the beginning I could tell that customer satisfaction was a priority for them. Everyone from the staff in the office Val, Tracy , Miguel our sales rep, the installers (Adam and Jose) and Joey Timo did a great job. We did have one hiccup that was out of their control. It was promptly addressed by Miguel and Joey who were returning my phone calls on a Saturday while spending time with their families. The install went as scheduled and without any issues. We will definitely be calling Timo’s when it’s time to replace our second AC unit. We are now the coolest family in the neighborhood in more ways than one!</Text><user_name>Noe Lerma</user_name><user>115168857802986895574</user>< Time>

I could not have been more pleased with my experience with Timos. Anita, who took my service order was very knowledgeable and pleasant, and confirmed my service request through to the arrival of the service technition. Eddie, the service technician, was outstanding and professional through every step of the HVAC service. Eddie has excellent social and organizational skills; no question was too small and he followed through with detailed paperwork that helped me understand the workings of my system. Please commend him upon his professionalism, knowledge, and representation of Timos. Two friends that happened to be visiting and are looking to upgrade and/or replace their systems were so impreesed by Eddie that they asked for his card.<//text>

<Review>Very professional and explained everything. My only complaint is when the guy came in to replace my air filter, he was not wearing a mask. I didn't catch it until he was almost done. He said he had been vaccinated two days prior, however, you are not fully vaccinated until 2 weeks after your second shot. I am high risk and do not let people into my home, so I really hope that, my wearing a mask will be sufficient. Need to be more careful about this! I'm sure it was an unintentional oversight, as he even took the time to put shoe coverings on, but this is too serious to be careless about. He was apologetic, but...< /Review>< name>

Fantastic customer service from quote to installation.  Miguel came out and was very knowledgeable and didn’t try to over sell the project. Always got a text or a call when they were coming out. We had a tight timeline to get it installed before we left and the company was very accommodating. Sent two teams out to install the two systems. Install teams were very attentive, friendly and helpful in explaining what they were doing and the process. At the end they even mentioned they may have damaged something in the house. It wasn’t them and it was a minor issue before they came but was so impressed with the honesty. Great clean up. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<Text>I was contacted today to schedule an A/C Annual Maintenance for March 17th.  I asked for an earlier date like this afternoon.  Timo’s came within the hour and completed our A/C Maintenance.  Nick, service tech, gave us a thorough review of the current status of our A/C.  We have been very pleased with Timo’s from the install of our new Trane A/C-Furnace System two years ago, to every annual maintenance check up we have had since the installation.  Their customer service has been spectacular.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I was charged $665. For the part I found on Dreisilker for under $200.00. Here is the text I received this morning.
Good Morning Aaron , Nick installed Condenser Fan Motor Century_ Dreisilker SKU:FE1038SF.

I heard they had a new service manager that gouges, but I had no idea to the extent. Don’t go with them, for labor of an hour, ugh just disappointed. Gouging generations of Coachella valley residents!<//Review>< Resp>

Thank you Timo’s! My AC went out late on a 112 degree afternoon.  After trying to troubleshoot ourselves, I submitted an appointment request via the web portal around 10pm.  I had someone in my home before 9am the next day.  The technician was knowledgeable, diagnosed the issue and fixed it right away.  I currently work from home supporting IT for a local hospital, so not getting it fixed quickly was not an option for us.  Timo’s to the rescue 😊 My family appreciates it so much!!  Timo’s is highly recommended and I will use them again in the future.<//review>

Andrew is very professional and is taking care of my issue of the comfort star air conditioning unit.  He is going that extra mile to find out if my unit is under warranty as well as to find out how to order the proper part to repair my unit. Its nice to have a honest person take care of me when I'm on a budget.
Thank you so much</Text>

Timo's has great customer service and good prices. I booked appt online and was contacted next day by Dawn. She was very helpful with getting an earlier appt booked for me and letting me know about options, costs and answering my questions. On day of appt - technician, Ernie, called to let me know when he was on his way to my place. Once here he did a great job at explaining what the issue was and what the repair cost would be. On top of repair I asked to add a new thermostat to replace a very old one which Ernie was fine with doing during visit too. Thanks Timo's!</review>

<Text>My new AC system wasn't working properly so I called Timo's the Friday morning before labor Day and they sent somebody out in about an hour!  I was really grateful to have a technician show up that quickly because otherwise I would have had to wait an additional four days due to the holiday weekend.  This was also during one of the hottest heat waves of the entire year.  So I'm very happy that they were able to find the problem and get things running smoothly.  Sam, the technician, was very knowledgeable and courteous - a real gem.< /Text>< pictures>

My AC stopped blowing cold air on a 115+degree day in the Desert.  I called Timo’s and they were able to send two AC Technicians out the same day.  They diagnosed the problem within minutes and explained all of my options.  I asked them many questions and they were patient, thorough and very informative.  The owner of the company even drove by to check on the AC Technicians and ask about the repair.  So, I was very satisfied with their customer service and expertise.  I highly recommend Timo’s.< /text>

We’ve used Timo’s the past couple of years for routine  maintenance and have always been impressed by their stellar customer service and technical skills.   When it came time to replace our aging HVAC system, we trusted none other than Timo’s to guide us through the process.   We had an on-site bid the same day we called and work was scheduled for the following week.  The crew was on-time and diligently worked all day to get the job completed.  They were courteous, professional and respectful of our property and walked us through the features of the new system.   Other than a new system, there was not a trace that the crew had spent the day.  We are happy that Timo’s is our trusted HVAC service provider!< /Review>

<Text>Customer service is amazing and they are all very friendly. The repair men showed up on time and did all the testing prior to quoting a price. They did not try to oversell me on parts or upgrades and offered spare parts to me at no extra cost. Very professional and would recommend, especially right now in the summer time.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My AC decided to die on a hot Sunday (of course).  I contacted Timo's AC and they were great - from the scheduler on the phone to the technician, Nick.  He showed up early, provided all the information I needed, etc. and I am very happy with the service they provided.  I really liked that I received a text when he was on the way and the invoice and additional detail were sent right after he left and were easy to understand.  Thanks - I would recommend Timo's!</text>

I just wanted to send you a short message to let you know that I’m extremely happy with my Install and Happy with the Install Team (Tom & David).
They actually installed both Systems in less than 2 days and did so by 2:30pm today!
They made sure that I was Happy with everything and asked me about the installation process of the Mini-Split . They also, answered any questions I had regarding the Heat Pump or Mini-Split system while they were busy removing the old System and preparing to install the new system.
I saw several different Timo Supervisors come by and helped them out the past couple days which shows a very close knit Work Family!
Thanks to Miguel for being patient in all of my Husband’s researching and helping my Husband make the CORRECT choice for our 21st Century HVAC replacement!< /review>

<Text>It was a Sunday afternoon when my AC decided to go on the blink.  Timo's promptly answered the phone and informed me a technician will be at my house in three hours or less.  Anthony was quick to identify the issue.  He explained the problem and the solution.  In addition to his knowledge and professionalism, Anthony was a pleasure to meet and converse with.

Timo’s service is the best.  I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with them every time I’ve needed them.  Sam was here today, he listened to my issue, verified the condition of the equipment, and then made the appropriate repairs.    Stop searching and call them.< /text>

Oscar was my technician. I was told he was very knowledgeable about the type of Fujitsu AC I
own. He called to let me know, when he’d arrive. He introduced himself, I explained my issue and he said he’d run some diagnostic tests.  Within a few minutes, he determined the end of the louver was cracked and required replacement. Since it was end of day, he said he’d call me, when he had the price for my part. I was very pleased with everyone I spoke with at Timo’s!< /Text>

I checked on time, but Earl was actually early. No pun intended. We noticed the house was a bit warm so I called Timos. Dawn said they had a cancellation so she was able to fit us in same day. We purchased the maintenance plan, and got 20% off the part we needed. Earl showed up, fixed the problem and did the maintenance, too. I highly recommend Timo’s. Our AC is aging and we will definitely use them for replacement.< /Review>

The staff answering the call was very professional, patient and understanding. She was able to schedule a technician visit the same day! The technician called 15 min prior to coming over. He was very polite and professional. He was able to assess the problem and fix it all within 30 min. It was hassle free. We plan to schedule regular maintenance with this company from this point on. They are trustworthy, professional and a good value!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Earl was my technician who analyzed the A/C inside and then up on roof of two stories. He not only fixed my immediate problem, he did a full servicing needing to go up three times. The bill included my freon charge but the servicing charge of $69 was removed. I was certainly glad I called Timo's!</Review>< pics>

The reason I am giving two starts though is because of the horrendous emergency response system they “have in place”. Without going into details I will just say that if you want a company that will address an emergency after hours, this is not the company for you. Despite the amazing efforts of the employees that work there, there is no excuse for not responding to multiple after hours emergency calls. Such a shame for them to say they provide that service and not follow through.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This was my first time using Timo's.  I have a Home Warranty but when I contacted Home Warranty and they reached out to the company that handle this product the soonest they could come was on 4/12.  I decided that was not good as the temperatures in our area would be in the high 90's.<//Text>

I’m so sorry to hear you did not receive your estimate. As a service business, we generate our income by repairing and replacing bad parts. Simply selling a diagnostic fee does not even cover the cost to send the technician/truck to the home. Perhaps the estimate email was dropped or bounced back.\n\nEdit: I spoke with your technician and got more information. He said that you stated you were going to take the motor back to Home Depot, where you bought it, to see if they would warranty it for you. Your technician provided two estimates at 2:32PM. He stayed for an additional 30 minutes and removed the motor for you, at no additional charge, so you could take it back to Home Depot.'}<//response></record></dataset><record>

Timo’s was a breath of fresh  air to deal with. We live in Florida and opted to have Old System removed and installation of new one in Palm Springs for my elderly father-in-law. Being so many miles away Timo’s staff made it an easy process for our family. They had someone out to the home Less than 24hrs.  Tim was our contact going into the home and even had a portable unit set up to get by a few days until installation. He was very informative and gave us the information we needed to make the decision to either replace what was broken and maybe fix our problem or go with a newer system that wasn’t original to the home. No sales pressure whatsoever and several recommendations were given. I loved that they have the feature of knowing exactly when your tech is on the way and also how they will handle the city permit and HOA approval. Dawn (office) and Tim (on-site) were my contacts and they were wonderful. I can’t say enough POSITIVE about our experience  with TIMO’S. Call them ASAP. Highly recommend. Friendly, professional and responsive. You have nothing to loose with a FREE Estimate. You will not be disappointed.<//text>

<Name>shadow demon</Name><time>1594518739675<//time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Had them come in and check my A/C because I was not cold air from my roof top AC. After being on the roof 5min he came down and said everything is working fine. But the coils just aren't getting cold. I asked what the solution is, he suggested I install a brand new air conditioning unit because my 13yr old unit runs on old r22 refrigerant and can't be serviced anymore. At a cost of nearly 5k. Had a friend of friend come over and he found the problem right away. It was the thermal expansion valve. Be warned they will try hard to sell you a new AC and not try and fix the problem<//text>< Pics>

Timo's installed my system and have maintained it for 3 years. Extremely please with all their service technicians. Damian has serviced my system several times and is very professional and explains in layman's terms when I have a questions. I have recommended Timo's to several friends and acquaintances.< /review>

Nick showed up exactly on time, he was easy to talk to (especially since I don't speak HVAC language) and he was persistent in finding and fixing the problem and patient in explaining the problem to me. The folks in the office were also kindly patient with me when I realized I had double booked my initial appointment; they made quick changes to their technician's schedule and made the re-booking process easier than I could have expected. I give Timo's a strong positive recommendation .<//text>

As soon as I got off the phone with I received a call from the technician, Earl, telling me that he would be at the house in 20 minutes. He arrived on time and quickly diagnosed the problem. He made his recommendation and I agreed to the service. He then ran another diagnostic and came across another issue with the system. I again agreed to his recommendation. I  recently had this system serviced by another company and they did not address any of the issues that Earl brought to my attention. Thank You Timo’s!!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Complete installation took approximately 4.5 hrs.   An additional plus was leaving the premise totally clean and hauling away the old furnace and used parts.  Very nice, indeed!!!

Timo’s did an excellent job for maintenance of my furnaces and filters.  Oscar was on time, efficient, thorough, and informative.  He serviced my units, cleaned everything and made recommendations of what I might need in the future.  There was no hard-sell, only things to consider.  He explained what he did and why, making sure everything was spotless when he finished.  I will see him again in 6 months when he services my air conditioners.<//review>

< review>
Unit was previously serviced one year ago with 4 lbs of refrigerant added. Possible defective valve replaced. Top of the line TRANE installed by Joey. This service call was basically for the same thing as last years. Tech “Chris” checked unit and again installed up to 4 lbs of refrigerant???? Unit will be rechecked on August 26 for problems and refrigerant charge if necessary. Very costly maintenance that should not be required for a Quality TRANE unit And Timos. Tech Chris was excellent. Help, Senior Citizen 85 on Social Security can’t afford this!!</review>

<Review>Joe and Joey,
Thank you both for helping Hilda and I with our 3 HVAC units and installation.
We can’t tell you how happy we are with the end result!
I would like to share my “customer experience” with you...
Glenn Smith was the first to come to the house...he is a true professional. I appreciated him coming by and walking me through the different options.
Glenn is knowledgeable and very honest - the two most important qualities you can possess, if you ask me.
Being in sales myself, I would hope my customers view me in the same way as I view Glenn.
I would also like to share that I asked each of the guys that were here to help with the install, what they thought about Timo’s, how they felt about working there, working with you, working for you both, etc.
On the first day, it was Tom and Greg...they did an absolutely awesome job!!
I asked both of them separately how they liked the company and how they liked working with you.
Both are extremely happy with the company - Tom has been with you for several years now and Greg is recently new to you.
Both mentioned separately how nice it is to work for you both and how great it is to work for such a professional, well-organized company!!
Today (the second day) it was Tom, Greg, Mark, and Bobby.
All 4 arrived on time and ready to work!!
Mark and Bobby also did a fantastic job...could not be more happy with them and the work they did.
I also asked them separately how they felt about working for you both and working with Timo’s in general.
Both mentioned how they love working for your company because it is so well-organized, and separately, they also mentioned how they feel extremely appreciated and taken care of!
Throughout the entire process, Tracy was keeping me updated and informed as to what steps were next, asking if I was happy with the staff, was I happy with the work, and after the install was complete, was I happy with the overall service, etc.
Tracy was fantastic - great job!!
I’m certain a simple thank you would have been adequate, however, I really wanted you both to know what a great company, and what great people you have working for you.
Thank you both again...
Have a nice night and a great weekend...stay safe!
Bob and Hilda<//Review>< pictures>

Great customer service, honest business. I purchased a new a/c system from them, they provided competitive pricing but it’s their honest  staff that sold me. After having my previous a/c company quote me $2k to fix leak, Timo’s came & fixed it for free. It wasn’t a $2k issue after all. You will be completely satisfied with office staff & service techs.< /review>

< Review>
Andrew was Awesome. He was on time, courteous and fixed the problem. Further he suggested a maintenance plan. Super helpful and I would recommend Timo’s and will use Timo’s from now on.

Thanks.

<Text>We just replaced an air conditioner and furnace, as well as all our duct work. Chris Dalton from Timo's Air Conditioning & Heating came out to inspect the equipment and duct work and then explain our options. Chris was thorough and explained each option well. I appreciated his patience and never felt rushed or pressured, and he was helpful in getting our financing worked out. I'd happily recommend Timo's to anyone. The teams who came to install the equipment and ducts were friendly and professional. People arrived when expected and left things clean. Our house is definitely more comfortable now!< /Text></record>

Ken from Timo's was fantastic. He was very professional, polite, and explained everything with great detail. Ken came out and took all kinds of measurements which none of the other companies we interview did. Ken gave us an estimate at the time of his visit and we had a formal estimate within a few hours. We had a 5-Ton Lennox XC25 air conditioner installed with all new duct work. Adam and Vince the installers were extremely knowledgeable, efficient, and extremely polite. Joe Timo, the owner was working behind the scenes and gave us a great deal on our install. During the job they setup runners on the floors to keep them clean and covered work areas with plastic. They even set us up with a portable A/C unit for the 2 day installation. One day for the duct work and one day for the Air Conditioner. We interviewed 5 different companies before we picked Timo's. They were the most professional with face to face interactions and price quote paperwork. The price was fair and what I initially expected. Everyone wore masks due to COVID-19. Great company and a great bunch of people. I highly recommend Timo's for any and all A/C work.<//Text>

From beginning to end of my experience with Timos I was kept up to date when my appointment was, a reminder and the tech I was looking for the service maintenance I ordered. Oscar was exceptional, professional explained everything about my AC and set me up for a summer/winter maintenance that really adds value knowing if something comes up you’re covered with a incentive discount. 5 STARS FOR TIMO’s and OSCAR< /Text>

Fast, within minutes, reply to my online request for an estimate. Scheduled for the next business day. I received a text confirmation and a reminder. Another the morning of and a call when Ken was half an hour away.  He arrived on time in a colorful Timo’s vehicle. Ken reviewed and documented my request. He quoted the price and how the work would be performed. He also did further research on my equipment when I asked for other options. The work is scheduled to be performed two days from now. Hopefully I’ll be able to add to my report when completed< /review>

< Review>
I’m a out of town Condo owner that rents my unit using a local rental agency. When the person renting had no heat the rental agency sent a AC/Heating company which said I needed a completely new system which would cost $7400!
I remembered that I used Timo’s ten years earlier and had a good experience then. I had Timo’s come out and they found the “Thermostat had corrosion so contact was intermittent. After replacing the thermostat & cleaning the heating element the system was back working perfectly! Timo’s honesty, punctuality  and courteous technician, along with an office staff that was professional cost me a fair & honest price of $345 vs $7400, including an additional yearly (1 AC & 1Heating Service) with Filter change in the coming year! That’s my Christmas present!!!!<//Review>

First,  let me say that this was my first time working with Timo's so there is no other history with them.   The sales rep and engineer who came out to the house was very thorough, informative, and helpful in assessing my needs.  Once I had decided to go with them and signed the contract we were able to schedule the work very quickly.  The guys who came to do the installation were friendly, courteous, and spent the day getting the job done without wasting any time. I spoke with five different well known companies getting my proposals and feel very confident that I made the right choice.</review>

<Gmap_id>0x80db1b0bb52fcce9:0xb5bceab20e376e6d</Gmap_id><Text>We are very happy with the fast, efficient service from Timo's highly professional technicians. Timo's had to make a temporary repair to our 2 1/2 year old Goodman (builder's chosen HVAC). Timo's installed a Lennox 4-ton 2-stage HVAC system. Immediately, we noted how much quieter the new system was. The installed cost was not much more than the labor costs for replacing the defective Goodman parts (parts under warranty).  We are glad we chose Timo's and Lennox. Now the inside temperature stays even throughout the day and night, even in 115 degree heat. And we hardly notice when the HVAC is on. The Lennox system seems to be very efficient and should save $ on electric bills.</Text></record>

<text>The installers were knowledgeable and did not dilly-dally when it came to getting the job done.  So far everything seems good, I'm getting cool air (so nice).
The only negative comment I have is that both the inside wall mount blower and the outside condensing unit were not placed straight.  The inside blower looked at an angle, I had the tech correct it (as best as he could).  Also, the outdoor condensing unit was installed 1-1/4" off from front to back.  The tech removed the screws holding the unit in place, straightened it to an even distance from the house and replaced the screws.
Thank you for getting this job done.  You have professional, courteous techs.</text><GmapID>0x80db1b0bb52fcce9:0xb5bceab20e376e6d</GmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

Timos installed my new AC several years ago and they service my AC, Evap Cooler and Heat twice a year.   I love their tech guys and the office staff.   I would recommend them to anyone needing equipment or service.<//Review>

The installers were knowledgeable and did not dilly-dally when it came to getting the job done.  So far everything seems good, I'm getting cool air (so nice).
The only negative comment I have is that both the inside wall mount blower and the outside condensing unit were not placed straight.  The inside blower looked at an angle, I had the tech correct it (as best as he could).  Also, the outdoor condensing unit was installed 1-1/4" off from front to back.  The tech removed the screws holding the unit in place, straightened it to an even distance from the house and replaced the screws.
Thank you for getting this job done.  You have professional, courteous techs.<//Text>

I have heard great things about this company. Read a few reviews, and decided to call them. They not just met my high expectations but they also exceeded them. From the scheduling process, to getting a text with a picture of technician prior to arrival, and his bio, to the quality of service, wow wow wow! I will not use any other company from now on. Timo’s will be my go to< /text>

We found Timo’s by checking review sites after our ac decided to go out 2 months after we closed on our second home here in Palm Springs and 2 days before 8 family members arrived for our first 4th of July and housewarming here in the desert.  We were thrilled as you can imagine when they were able to come out almost immediately (in the one teens as you might expect) and get us up and running in a matter of hours.  We’ve been loyal customers ever sense and they’ve been stellar service providers for going on 9 years now.  We use their annual service plan with their friendly and very necessary reminders for us.  This way we never forget to keep our system clean and running smoothly for all seasons.  Our technicians have been super courteous, professional, knowledgeable, timely, communicative  and efficient.  Highly recommend!<//Text>

Timo’s is absolutely the best. !!   Installed our heating and AC system in 2018. We needed a tune up and recharge before the Summer heat.
Nick from Timos was professional and fit us into an already overbooked day.  We are ready for Summer.
Thanks Timo’s.</review>

They were honest & trustworthy which is rare these days. The sales consultant & services manager and the installers were all a pleasure to deal with as was the receptionist who coordinated the install for us. When a slight problem occurred with the install the service manager stepped in and handle the situation with efficiency and calm. The outcome for us was really positive. We are so pleased with our new heat pump & air handler. Whatever your heating & cooling needs are I truly believe Timo’s team has the best solution & product out there, they can work with every budget & they have competent installers who do a clean job!</Text>< Pictures>

We’ve trusted no one else for the last 5 years and have NOT been disappointed with Timo’s yet. We had a new AC and furnace system installed this week. From Marcus, our service person, to Tom and Jack, our installers, the professionalism can’t be compared. Perfect system and they cleaned up after so you wouldn’t know they were here. They also gave us temporary portable units, so we were comfortable in between. Excellent!</Review>

<Review>We arrived at our condo in Palm Springs Friday 7.14.19 at around 5pm. It was 115 outside and when I turned on the A/C it would not cool. I called Timo’s received the answering service, I received a return call in less than 10 minutes, and a tech was scheduled to be there between 7-8p. Oscar arrived at 730p immediately diagnosed the problem, explained my options and fixed the issue. From my first contact with Timo’s after hours on a Friday evening to my A/C starting to cool was less than 2 hours. Everyone worked with a sense of urgency, professionalism and strong customer service. Their focus on my issue saved the day. Thanks Timo’s I’m a loyal customer.< /Review></record>

Outstanding customer service! Timo’s came to my rescue after another company failed at installing a Nest Thermostat in my rental home. I spoke to the owner via Yelp on Saturday evening, Anita in the office called me Monday morning and she sent out Oscar just shortly after our conversation. Oscar was very professional and was able to install the thermostat without an issue! He also serviced my A/C unit - all at a very fair price. Timo’s has gained a customer for life. Thanks again you guys!</text>

Timo’s came highly recommended to me and I will pass that same high recommendation along.  They have replaced six A/C - heating systems in my neighborhood.  We’ve all been very pleased with their professionalism and efficiency.

They were very careful about keeping things clean and not causing any damage.  Mark and his crew were personable and pleasant to deal with.  I wouldn’t hesitate to refer my friends to Timo’s.< /text>

I was not expecting such a positive experience. Tom and Bobby went beyond my expectations. I normally don't post reviews but this is an exception.  They obviously work for a great company. Thank you to the whole team.< /review>

<Text>We just had our new HVAC system installed, the process was smooth and went as expected. Both Vincent and Daniel did excellent work and finished the job beautifully and on time. Thanks guys!  Also a big thanks goes out to Glenn who sold us our new Trane system, for explaining the whole process, giving us different options and not up-selling us with more than what we needed. Overall, we are very pleased and would recommend Timo’s to anyone needing heating and a/c work done!< /Text>< Pictures>

Andrew did a fine job repairing my a/c and worked until after dark (9:30 pm) to complete the job.  He explained what caused the problem and what he needed to do to fix it.  I really appreciate his knowledge and courtesy.  Timo's Air Conditioning & Heating is the best.</text>

Undecided if they sold me a new thermostat that I didn’t need or not. I could have taken my chances and kept using my old one that I was told was broken. It was not broken. Yes, it wasn’t brand new but might have lasted me a few more years. Kind of a guessing game and I’m not sure if I was taken or not. Can’t predict the future. I guess better to be safe than sorry and just have then do it and be done with it. Cheaper routes to go.</Text>

< Review>
The condenser couldn't have picked a worse day to go kaput. Palm Springs just broke a 50 year temp high. But these guys were top notch all the way. From getting us on their schedule same day, to repairing what was broken during a single appointment, to making sound recommendations, it couldn't have gone smoother. And we were able to get a 20% discount along with two future service appointments.  If you're not using Timo's you're settling for second tier service providers.< /Review>

They came out a replaced the main machine and my air has been cold ever since. They re ducted my home which is also mid century and insulated the attic. The house electric costs changed to $100 less every month in the summer. They are trustworthy and efficient, so nice and accommodating.</review></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service. Chris the representative that came to our home was very knowledgeable. Technicians were efficient and worked diligently to finish the job on time. We had four different quotes and decided on Timo not because they were the cheapest but because they provided the service and follow-thorough we wanted for our investment.<//Review>

<Text>This was our first experience with Timo's.  Eddie was excellent and provided knowledge we needed for both the heating and air services we will need.  This was not explained when I called corporate but Eddie did a great job of explaining they will need to come back just before summer to service the A/C.  We had a very good experience because of Eddie and look forward to him returning to service the A/C part of our unit just before June.

Very pleased with the service by everybody involved from timo's. They came to our rescue and got our new air conditioner installed the day after we had them come look at our old one. Everybody was very pleasant. The installers did a phenomenal job. Left a very tidy garage and compressor area. Very happy with the service we received. I will recommend timo's for sure.</Text>

<Text>Called after hours to get what I assumed was a new fuse in the forced air unit. After leaving a message with the answering service I got a call back in about 30 minutes and the tech was here 20 minutes after that. Sure enough it was a blown fuse and he fixed it after checking everything out. Afterwards he stayed and answered a few questions about A/C and was very courteous and helpful. It was an altogether  very pleasant experience. Timo was recommended to me by a friend who did extensive research and I’m happy to pass that recommendation on to others.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I really do like this company, and would have given 4 to 5 stars but... They put a new AC/Heating unit on this summer with new ducting.  All was well till cold weather came.  The unit did not work correctly and have had a real time of it getting it fixed.  Positive is that every time I called they came out, negative is that they should have been the ones following up with me.  Until we ended up with the supervisor Marcos, he came out finally fixed the issue, then the next day he called to make sure all was good. It really did take a long time and we actually had to go out and buy Space heaters for the home, there were days that we could not even get the home over 65, and the mornings were even worse. I will be asking for an extension of the warranty.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1547843389863, 'text': "Jay, thank you for the review. And don't feel bad that its only 3-stars, we deserve this. Your system had a factory wiring harness issue that was incredibly difficult to locate. It wasn't until Marcus noticed a pin in the harness, not seated correctly, that we were able to rectify the problem. Sometimes these little issues can escape even the best of us. My sincere apologies that you were the unfortunate customer who had to experience an issue. We're better technicians, today, because of it and your patience was truly appreciated. We're going to throw in an additional year on your labor warranty to show we stand by the equipment and the repair. Thanks again for the business. - Joe"}</response>< GmapID>

<Review>In just customer service I give them 5 stars. Shout out to Joey and dawn the  customer service rep at Timo's A.C. I appreciate how they went above and beyond in just a  customer service phone call. I have not had a service from Timo's a.c yet. But I will definitely be calling joey and Timo's A.C Team when I need to replace my whole A.C. unit.

After my horrible experience with a Diffrent A.C. company and horrible customer service.

I thank you timo's A.C. ! for your humbleness and great customer service.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Wow wow wow! I'm so impressed with the service I got from Timo's. All the staff were so warm and professional. Glen was so sincere and had my best intentions he was not trying to upsell or scare me into getting something I didn't want. I say that because I contacted other companies for a quote. Not only did they try to scare me to use them, saying other companies will have hidden fees,well maybe others but not Timo's. The others also didn't tell me all my options and they were charging $5,000 more for the same job.
Timo's staff Rock
Timos service is amazing and quick
Timo's prices are affordable.

P.S. one regret is not looking on their website for coupons...they have some very nice offers that would of been the icing on the cake for me.</review><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

Nothing but good words to say about my recent service call. Andrew was great. All needed work was clearly explained and done with a thoroughly itemized bill. There may be less expensive services out there but one thing I don't want to leave to the less professional people is my air conditioning unit!</Text>

For reasons not important here, the A/C condenser couldn't be placed in the spot we wanted... which was only discovered on the morning of the installation.  We couldn't delay the installation because my husband was very ill.  The kind people at Timo's said they would move it when we were ready and give us a good deal on the work.  Today, two-and-a-half years later, they kept their word.
The staff at Timo's, from the office to the installers are professional, informed, courteous and very customer oriented.  Their work is impeccable.  Oh!

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Tim's did and Outstanding job!! From our first visit with Chris, we knew right away that we were going with this company. The service techs/installers were kind, courteous and very knowledgeable. Best decision we ever made was going with Tim's for the replacement of our HVAC units.< /Review>< Name>

It was 115 degrees on a Sunday and air conditioners were having problems all over town. I called several HVAC companies and left voicemail but got no return calls. A friend recommended Timos and they got back to me within 15 minutes and had a technician at the house within the hour. Jason was really helpful and thorough in showing me the problem and fixing it. I just moved here and was so impressed with the service that I asked about a maintenance program. I prefer preventing problems rather than fixing them and want to do it with a company I trust.</Review>

Timo's air have been life savers! The service is second to none, and they have saved me and my family from the summer heat more than once.
In June, we had 15 guests at our house for a birthday party, and our AC quit. Within an hour, the service technician was at our door. He was polite, and  very knowledgeable, and got our condenser motor working again in a flash.
From the first phone call, Timo's has been nothing short of a godsend. Joe and Joey are experts in the services their company provide, which is rare and refreshing.
Top to bottom, this company is my favorite to deal with; I won't go anywhere else for my heating and air conditioning needs.

My husband and I are away from the house needing A/C serving. Our realtor called Timos per our request and the service tech was there promptly.  He diagnosed the problem and called us back with a quote for the work.  He finished the work and emailed an invoice and receipt.  We are so pleased that Timos came through for us again.</text>

We recently had Timos come out to service our AC. It’s the middle of summer and we couldn’t get anyone out. I guess the commercial worked cause it’s the only other company off the top of my head I could think of. Well Timos got here within a couple hours and thank god it was an easy fix. $200.00 and we’re back up and running. No up-sell. No BS just straight up honest and prompt. When my Ac does go out I know who I’m calling. Thanks again Timos!</review>

{'time': 1589464654821, 'text': 'Hi, Donna. As much as we hate seeing bad reviews, all feedback is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to share your concern. I just want to clarify, for those reading, that in 2019 we added refrigerant to the system and said it may have a leak (our first time at property). On 4/23/20 we found it low on refrigerant again and suggested replacing the equipment due to the age and condition. You passed on scheduling an appointment to hear your options. However, on 4/27/20 you informed us that you moved forward with replacing the system with another company. We never attempted to fix your problem. We never even gave a quote. We added refrigerant once and on the second visit suggested speaking with a senior tech to discuss options and you, unfortunately, chose not to. Thank you for your business over the years. My sincere apologies your experience was less than 5-Star worthy. I hope your new system lasts for years to come.'}<//Resp>

What a pleasure to finally find a company who takes customer service and quality seriously! I had a problem with my a/c and called Timos from a referral by a neighbor. From the initial phone call to the hand shake, thank you for your business and goodbye, Timos was the epitome of professionalism and caring. I was also lucky enough to get Andrew as my technician as he was the nicest, most patient , caring person I’ve met in a while! He fixed the problem very quickly and also help me set up my Google Nest! I will always use a Timos for my HVAC needs and recommend them highly to my family and friends! Thanks Timos..... Thanks Andrew....my lucky day!</Review>

<Text>I called Timo’s to inquire about routine maintenance and after joining the semi-annual service plan during that call Andrew H. was at my door within the hour!. Andrew provided thorough service to my system as well as very clear and patient explanations to my many questions - all while being very professional, friendly and respectful of my home.

< Review>
The sales person was thorough and explained what the work entailed and was on board with the changes I wanted to make.  Recommended the proper tonage  for an efficient system along with a “seer” that would be adequate for my needs.
The two technicians were great with the lead working in the attic for 2 days.  He also walked me thru the new thermostat / app very quickly.

I required the techs to change one Trans unit because of excessive scratches .

Disappointed that at the completion  of the $22K job there was absolutely no follow up to see if I was happy with the purchase, extras ( additional insulation blown into the attic)  and if our re-routing of ac runs and sufficient flow to all my registers was sufficient. I adjusted my own.  No communication,  No follow-up.< /Review>

Timos is absolutely the BEST company for AC or heating needs. Everyone I have ever dealt with either on the phone or in person is always polite professional and so helpful.
I can’t say enough good things about Timos products people and service.
We had a maintenance performed today on our AC unit and Andrew was great. I feel confident that our system will work well for years to come because their people do a good job taking care of their products they install.<//Text>

We called Timo’s for a bid on a new system when our air conditioner failed and we were told by the company who does our regular maintenance that the unit could not be repaired. Timo’s performed a thorough check, provided a competitive bid, then to our surprise offered to repair our current system! Timo’s is trustworthy and honest, with competitive pricing and a professional staff, and we are using Timo’s going forward.< /text>

<review>When we first went looking for an AC company we were given estimates that were totally off-the-wall.  Unfortunately we live in a ZIP Code that leads salesmen to believe that everyone who lives here is wealthy. We are not.  When Glenn from Timo came we felt safe st last. “None of us is on a commission,” he said. “And Timo works on a strict 15% profit margin.” To make a long story short our new AC is in and working beautifully. Glenn and the people at Timo did everything they promised to do and more. Thank you Glenn! Thank you Timo we are grateful!< /review><Time>1568836313488<//Time></record>

Simple!  A/c was blowing warm air, called one company , call went to message center! 2nd call was to Timos! A live and courteous lady (Tracy) answered and in two minutes got my information and scheduled me for immediate service in one hour thirty mins , right on time ! Oscar , an angel in blue uniform arrived, found my problem and fixed it , very efficiently done and not at all as expensive as I imagined! Cudos to Oscar and Timos!! 😇😇😇< /review>

When the time came that we were ready to replace the AC we turned to Timo's. After reading numerous great reviews of Angie's List, they were our only call. We liked that they were a family run business and the owner's son Joey came out to give us a quote. He laid out three options for us, explaining each in terms we could easily understand. Not only were their prices better than the competition, Joey was honest with us, letting us know we would be happy with any of the three units he suggested. He didn't use scare tactics, or pressure us to make a decision on the spot. He was professional, kind and very knowledgeable. We felt well informed of our options, and Joey gave us his cell phone number in case he had any questions. The next day we decided to go with their top of the line Trane XL20i. With the stellar warranty, and clear energy saving capabilities, we knew it was the long term right choice.

Joey and his team were able to come less than a week later and install our new system. Everyone was friendly, professional, and even got the job done more quickly than we had expected. They made sure we knew how to program and use our new unit and take full advantage of its features before they left. We could not be happier with the new unit and choosing Timo's! Our projected bill this month is $87 compared to over $500 this time last year! I enthusiastically recommend Timo's to anyone for service, repairs and especially new system installation.<//text>

The installation team...lead by Adam were at my house 9:00 the next day...all three of those hard working fine gentlemen worked their butts off until 7:00 that eve...my system was installed and working beautifully. I’m still waiting for my other quote to come through in writing...and if I used the Home Warranty company... my first avail appoint was today at 2:15....I would have melted already.
In addition the written price of Timos was $1200.00 less then my verbal quote from the other company. Couldn’t be happier with Timos.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>We just had our first preventative check up for our new HVAC System with Eddie Moore and he was professional, knowledgeable and a really nice guy! We have always had excellent service with TIMOS starting with Chris and can honestly recommend this company. Eddie is our new rep and we are delighted.

Call them at 4:00 and they said it would be Saturday. Timo’s to the rescue. Called 5:15. Returned call at 5:35 saying someone would be out 7-9. I said Saturday morning ir evening?  They said NO   THAT NIGHT. THAT NIGHT. Oscar arrived at 7:30. Diagnosed by 8:00 and offered to fix it THAT NIGHT. He worked into the night and we had cooling before he left.  I HAVE NEVER HAD CUSTOMER SERVICE LIKE THIS. Lived in the desert for 6+ years and Timos is the only company from now on. Thanks Oscar. Thanks Timos

Repeat visit.  Perfect again. Early to the appointment, got everything checked out, helped me realize the water spigot on the balcony works (5 years here) and gone like a flash.  Great work. See you in the spring.</Text>< Pictures>

Chris was here and just completed our spring servicing on our HVAC system.  As always he was prompt, courteous, and throughout.  He walked us through all the test numbers and explained them in terms even I could understand.   Thank you Chris, I am looking forward to seeing you this fall.< /text>

Our AC stopped running on Friday night 7-9-18 , after calling a number of different AC companies we chose Timo's because they were able to come out the next morning. Oscar from Timo's arrived , diagnosed the problem, installed a new motor and filter within 45 minutes. Oscar was professional and courteous and did a great job ! Great customer service !<//review>

< review>
Well as you know it’s hot, like real hot. Operating a wood shop and dealing with expensive exotic hard woods is a hassle when your is over 100 degrees. At the advice of a friend I contacted Timos Air Conditioning. I was able to secure an appointment that day with “The God Of Thunder Himself” Chris Dalton. He accessed the situation in the shop and quickly came up with a plan. The next day, yes the next day, Vinny and Jack arrived at 9 AM, and installed a 3 Ton Mini split. I’m now able to keep the shop around 80 degrees when it’s blazing hot outside. I was a little shocked when they put down tarps on the floor and over my work benches. Every precaution to not make more of a mess was taken.
I called again today because our house system went out. Glenn was sent out. Sweet Jesus. He set me up with a new unit, which will be installed Saturday, yes Saturday. Again I have never been treated as well by any service company as I have been with Timos.</review>

<Text>Price gouging for refrigerant top-up.  Timo’s wanted $480 for this!  If I could have reached Blair H&A/C instead my total bill would have been $215.  Instead, I have to shop around for a better price as I already wasted $70 on Timo’s diagnostic fee (I knew it needed a top-up).  Looks like it will now cost about $100.  I hate it when companies rush out to beat the competition (I could have waited until the next day), and then try to scrape clean your wallet.</Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1555700663806, 'text': "Hi, Dale. Thanks for the review and for giving us a shot. I see here our technician was out last night at 9PM, at your request. I think it's important to clarify, we did not quote you $480 to top-off your system. We quoted you $290 to recharge your system. The additional cost (totaling $479 for everything), was to replace (2) schrader valve cores w/ new caps, to prevent your system from leaking again in the future. As you said it has leaked out in the past. A/C systems do not need to be topped-off. They are closed systems. If you need refrigerant, there is a leak and, by law, it needs to be repaired."}< /Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Have lived in the valley for over 15 years, and in that time have used a few different air conditioning companies for general service. We had a couple ‘major’ repairs needed for our units, once when we were over seas. The un-named company that discovered the issue gave us a wildly expensive quote (as our housesitter that knew nothing was at the place). We had two others come quote as well, that’s when we found Timo’s and have never turned back. The team they have is stellar. Fantastic customer service and very thorough/knowledgeable maintenance team. They are not here to make a buck by finding ‘issues’ with our systems, but do want them running as efficiently and clean as possible. They lay everything out in terms I can understand, not technical garble.  Was never satisfied until I found Timo’s, and won’t ever consider returning to the rude overpriced competition. 5 stars all around.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Timos was amazing. I called on a Sunday afternoon & they arrived about 30 minutes later. He needed a part that he didn’t have on his truck, so came next day & installed it. He didn’t charge for the first trip out.
Such reasonable charges for 5 star service! Our AC is running again thanks to Timos!</review><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80db1b0bb52fcce9:0xb5bceab20e376e6d<//gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><Pics>None</Pics>< Time>

I had a new system installed by Timo's about 2 years ago. Not only did they do an excellent job, but it lowered my electric bill by quite a bit. The staff was clean, quick, and friendly and have taken care of me every summer and winter since. Thanks Timos!<//review>

I started using Timo's after another air conditioning company tried to sell me a complete new unit. I decided to ask Timo's for a second opinion. Turns out that they came out and fixed a simple problem and they became my go to company. They sent Eddie to my home and he helped me to calm down and he set about fixing the problems. With this heat wave,  the fan on my condenser went out and I called Eddie at Timo's and he was there quickly and fixed the fan and got my house cool again. He is always the most courteous and calming for my fraid  nerves...I do not believe I would EVER use a different company. Bravo to Timo's</text>

I had my air conditioner not working in parts of my house today, desperately needed to get it repaired. As I waited on another company to call for repairs I came across this company & within 10 mins of my call the technician gave me a return call to ask my problem. He was at my house within 1/2 hour and repaired my issue within an hours time! I highly recommend these curteous and helpful people they were such a blessing at my most desperate hour as it was super hot in my house! Thank u Timo for getting the job done in sufficient time and now we can enjoy the rest of our summer with a cool house!! So pleased😀</Review>

< Review>
Wow! Terrible, terrible, terrible. So on Thursday my A/C went out. It was going to 108 degrees with 60% humidity. I called at noon and they said they couldn't come out till Friday. Really? Well, I said ok. I spent the night at my friend's place. My appointment was for 3:30 because I worked in the morning.  They ended up screwing up the time and went toy place at noon. So when I called at 3pm they said they had already come out but that they would come back between 3:30-4:30. So there I sat in my house in 90 degree heat. So I called back @ 5:10 when they hadn't arrived yet and the on call person said she'd call the tech and call right back.  So at 5:35 she calls me back to tell me she was giving me a courtesy call to let me know they were running late. And if I wanted to reschedule for Monday. Seriously?? Now it's Friday evening and my A/C won't be working all weekend? All I can say is don't even bother calling them. I finally went to the General and it was fixed on Saturday morning within 2 hours.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>After 12 years, it was time to replace the HVAC system in my 60 year-old house.  And I found myself in the same situation you're currently in -- there are so many air conditioning and heating companies in the valley, where do you even begin?

What I did was this:  I gave myself a big wide swath of time, I made a list of things I wanted out of a new HVAC system, I did my research and I got bids from everyone.  I can honestly say that I immersed myself in the terrifying underworld of conditioned air, and I can unequivocally recommend the folks at Timo's.

They were not the cheapest bid -- but they weren't the most expensive, either; you can entertain a wide range of prices when it comes to HVAC depending on your needs, and one of the things I appreciated about the folks at Timo's was their willingness to say when something wasn't needed or excessive.  They provided a new compressor, a new furnace, entirely new ductwork, a new low-voltage wire, and a digital thermostat; I added additional filtration and upgraded the registers, which they easily accommodated, and I also had they blow new insulation into a small attic area -- the end result is that everything is new, it works beautifully and it was all almost surgically placed within the confines of my home.

But what really made the difference, in my estimation, were the people I encountered who work for Timo's -- beyond always being on time and doing the job well, every single man and woman I encountered approached the job with enthusiasm and a sense of, well, fun.  It was fun for them to be updating an old house and an old house's system; they were excited to be doing it and they were excited to see what I thought when it was done.  The men and women who work for Joe TImo know the difference they're making in their customers' lives, and they really celebrate it.  It made the whole process a pleasure, and that's saying something.< /review><date>1492103332172</date>< user_name>
