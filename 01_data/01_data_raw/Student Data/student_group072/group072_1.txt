Well I went to change my transmission oil after purchasing a vehicle from a private seller at a different place and they caused a problem I didn't have before and it was going to cost me 500-1000 dollars. So I found West Kearny Mesa Transmission and went in for a second opinion. They were honest, and got to the bottom of it! I wish I would have went to them in the beginning! Truly confident in their technicians and I feel really well taken care of. I'm really glad that the reviews are true reviews. I am so happy and now I would recommend that everybody give them a chance. From now on they're the place I'm going to be going to.<//Text>

< Review>
I found this place because of the ads at gas stations. I knew I needed a new place to get work done on my car and have had some unfortunate issues with other shops, but once I said in passing to coworkers that I would use this shop they all said nothing but good things about them. I took my car in for a belt noise the tossed a 40 point inspection in for free and found out that the major repair I needed was my wheel barring I knew this noise was there but I had done all kinds of work at other shops and couldn’t fix it in 48 hours west automotive  not only found the problem but fixed it  and had my car back on the road sounding brand new. They definitely know cars, I highly recommend this place if you need a trustworthy place to keep your car safe and on the road. Tips for someone who’s not a car person always ask questions and preventative Maintenance is key for keeping your car safe.< /Review>

<Text>These wonderful gentlemen saved me thousands! I was quoted at another place for a full rebuild then denied service after asking too many questions about the increasing fees. I then found West Kearny Mesa Auto and had my car towed there for a second opinion. Turned out it was just a small piece that needed to be replaced, so they did that and a few other repairs for a fraction of what I would have paid, with no need for full transmission rebuild. I am so grateful. They had it back to me within a couple days running great. Highly recommend. Thanks guys!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My mom took my 2005 Acura to this shop because she was in San Diego when the check engine light came on. I chose them because AAA had them on the list for a free 40 point inspection. They recommended over $3,600 in services, most of which were not necessary. They took advantage of the fact that she was out of town and scared us into doing additional work under the guise of safety. I had a friend who was a mechanic contact them and they were completely uncooperative. Unfortunately, I had already authorized the work. They returned the car with additional codes that turned on as a result of their work and attempted to charge us for review of those codes. I took the car to a local Acura specialist when my mom got back home and they confirmed that we were taken advantage of. In fact, they said that we were sold “snake oil” and “hosed.” I do not recommend these guys at all.</Review>< pics>

{'time': 1617054255196, 'text': 'Lisa, I am terribly sorry you feel we did not have your Mothers best Interest at stake. Our clients Satisfaction is the number priority to all my Employees at the West Automotive Group.  There are however some inaccuracies in your story. Number one we did not proceed with any services prior to providing a diagnosis for the miss-fire / Check Engine light concern the vehicle was brought in for, which turned out to be tight valves on your mother’s vehicle.  We recommend adjusting the valves and verify we had corrected the concern prior to recommending other repairs. You did have a technician that was a family friend contact Bill, we were incredibly open with your Technician friend, He spoke freely with Bill and agreed on our recommended repair and course of action was proper and what he would also recommend. I retrieved the Recorded phone call to verify, and it was very friendly conversation and there was an open exchange. I am not sure how you arrived at the idea we were uncooperative; nothing could be further from the truth. All service and repair options were discussed with you and your mother during this entire time, you were also advised there were Traction control and other dash lights on the would not leave your mother stranded and you agreed you would have them address at a later date when she returned home. No repairs or services were performed without your approval and I am sure you ran them by your Technician prior to Authorization with us, leaving me with an unanswered concern about your statements. All of our repairs and services come with a 2 Year or 24,000-mile nationwide warranty and are all performed under Industry standards, So I am also very confused on the Snake oil and hosed statement. I am more than happy to help you in any way I can if you would like to speak with me directly please feel free to reach out. Brian Bowersock 760-741-0071'}<//resp>

This is the only place I trust to take my cars in the area and every time I'm there I am treated well and taken care of quickly. West Kearny Mesa Automotive & Transmission has always been my go to guy there and he is very helpful and honest. I will continue to bring my new car here when needed. I also love their shuttle service to give me a ride home when I've needed it. Thanks guys!<//Review>

WKMA&T is my new go to for all automotive business services.

Bill was kind, professional and diligent in communicating, offering options, patiently   answering questions and following up step by step through the process. Where other shops in the area quoted me nearly 3x the price and upwelling, I felt Bill to be honest and straightforward.

Additionally WKMA&T was kind enough to shuttle me to the shop to pick up my vehicle. The driver was pleasant, upbeat and professional.<//text>

< review>
I own a vehicle that is notorious for water pump failure. When I started to hear a noise coming from the water pump (no leakage, yet), I purchased a water pump from a dealership with the intention of having West Auto Group do the install. After consulting other owners of this vehicle model, I decided to have other components replaced at the same time, and some fluids changed. Upon the completion of the work, I picked up my vehicle and drove it home, approximately four miles. When I got home, there was coolant coming out on the street. One of the hoses that had been replaced had a hole worn in it from contact with an upper pulley. I called and told them it was leaking coolant. It was the end of the work day and I was told if I needed to bring it back to do so the next day. Well, with the hose compromised, I didn't want to drive it. So the next morning, the mechanic came to my house with a new hose and coolant, changed the hose, and made sure it was the correct length so it would not rub on the pulley. It was a pleasant surprise to find a business that will make good on their service, even if they have to send someone to your house. I will be bringing my vehicle to them for additional recommended services in the future< /review>

Had a rough idle with my Volvo. My regular mechanic was booked for two weeks so I needed to get it looked at first.  I had originally taken it to the El Cajon location but they where booked until following week. They called this location and they where able to get me in same day.

Nick was working the front and was very knowledgeable and friendly. I explained issues I was having and he explained the process and the expected timeline.

They kept me informed the whole time. They fixed one of the issues I was having and let me know the other issue ( it was mass air flow sensor I had bought and the part was faulty) I'm very happy with the service they provided at a reasonable price.

I will not hesitate to use these guys again!<//review>

Since i like to listen to auto talk on the radio this was the only place i wanted to take my car to. Very pleasant on the phone, nice and clean reception area and pleasant people in there. Went in for what i needed done and was advised on things to do for future maintenance, which i plan on having done there, also. Definitely recommend</Review>

When I decided to find a place to service my Subaru and not use the dealer, I went to West because that's what I chose with my very first car years ago. It was time for my 60K maintenance and the staff at West Kearny Mesa was very helpful from the start. Told me what was needed, how much is would cost, and offered recommendations if needed.
Booking my appointment was fast and simple as was the response time from Ronnel. When I arrived, they started right away.
I was blown away with the text message received once service was done with a full account of the work performed including pictures.
Nick was quite helpful as well checking in/out despite the issues they were having with the wi-fi.

I saw they offer shuttle service too which will consider in the future (if needed). My car will be happy to return next time more work is needed.<//review>

<Text>Customer service is everything and Nic always nails it. I’ve been with him with all my vehicles and at his prior places of employment, and I willingly commute to Kearny Mesa just because of the amazing work he does. Automotive places are known to rip you off but Nic lays it all down, is honest and does everything he can to help every customer. This industry needs more people like him and I’ll continue to come to him. Highly recommend if you’re in SD County but it’s definitely worth the commute, as well.</Text>< rate>

During a very stressful and time sensitive afternoon, the staff at west kearny Mesa automotive made me feel at ease about what needed to be done and then finished the job ahead of the original estimated time they gave me. I got back on the road with no issues. Thank you to the staff, specially  Nick.</text>

These guys are great! I needed a new shop to go to since the one I used to go to closed. They were very thorough and kept me informed about repairs, and got the car back on the road quickly, I will definitely be returning for any future maintenance.< /review>

<Text>**UPDATE 9/30**  I just had to take my car into the shop due to some issues that I was having on it.  Unfortunately, I had to take my car to a different shop as I wasn't in a place where West Kearny Mesa Automotive & Transmission could work on it.  However; I called these guys and talked them through what was happening, what the shop was wanting to charge me and what they were going to do.  These guys were able to assure me that the pricing was good, and that I wasn't get ripped off.  They provided me with my warranty information (I didn't have it on me at the time) so that I could turn the info into this other shop.  I practically had to take my car to another shop - and these guys still took care of me.  This is why they'll continue to get my business and all the word of mouth that I can possible give them.  THANK YOU!

On Black Friday, while I was working my car decided to break down. I have been taking my car to my local Ford dealership. After trying to call them and deal with their offsite call center, I opted to hang up and try to find someone else that I could get my car into ASAP - and that's when I found Brian at West Kearny Mesa Auto. This guy was a god send. He arranged to have a tow truck pick up my car and myself and within 10 minutes I was in my way to his shop. I was immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the shop, lobby/waiting area, front desk, and restrooms. This place doesn't look like an auto shop at all! Customer service was above and beyond. Most places, I feel, tend to try getting you to pay for repairs that are not really needed - not this place. This place does the right thing and they don't give up their integrity - and they even saved me about $600 in labor as well! I have found a new place to take my car for work. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will shout it from the rooftops!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>Went in to get my lights fixed.They had my car what seemed all day. They didn't call,  we called them, they didn't find anything wrong with the lights, I waited while he talked to clients over the phone. I felt ignored, without a car all day, without working brake lights and the privilege of paying $199. Stopped bought light bulbs and put them on.
Yesterday I received a phone call requesting to speak to me about my disappointing experience. I was given a sincere apology, and explanation for the wait time. Only one person and swamped.
Thank you for taking the time.  I will go back and give them another chance.
They have earned my total trust!
We have taken our Jaguar and our Chevy truck. They give you an estimate and stick to it. Very happy!</Text><name>Terie Keel< /name><gmapID>0x80dbffeaae9c59dd:0xfe7101bc54f79fd3< /gmapID>< resp>

The estimate of my car repair was too high. Can't afford more than $3,000 for the repair. I went to the other place they charged me a lot cheaper and affordable than this place and my car is totally fine now. Thanks for the too high estimate. I won't go back here anymore.< /Text>

{'time': 1593543111935, 'text': 'Maki,\nI notice your vehicle was in to us last over a year ago, I apologize that you feel the estimate we supplied you with was higher than you expected, often repairs that are being compared are not apples for apples in other words, the quality of parts and qualifications of the technician at the other facility will vary. At the West Automotive Group we only use OEM components and estimate all repairs right from the National Standard guide along with supplying a 2 year, 24,000 mile warranty The quality of work and the quality of parts are what drive the price, if you were to compare another quality facilities using quality parts to our estimate you would see we are extremely competitive. Often other lower estimating facilities do not employ ASE Certified technicians and use lower quality offshore parts along with the fact they supply the client with little or no warranty. I am happy your vehicle is working for you, and I hope it continues to do so. At the West Automotive Group quality and customer satisfaction are of the highest priority to us and our clients. We strive for complete satisfaction, if you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to myself directly. Brian Bowersock 760-741-0071'}< /Response>

<Name>Andrew Jones< /Name><time>1512078750954< /time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I originally heard of West Automotive Group from the weekend radio show "Auto Talk" on AM 760. I enjoyed the show and the host's company stuck in the back of my mind.

I needed a 90k service on my 2006 vehicle. The dealer estimate was $179 plus tax. West totaled out at $97. Matt, the manager was honest, straightforward and friendly. Several hundred dollars in deferrable maintenance that would have a) cost way more at the dealership and b) isn't immediately pressing was explained to me and not pushed at all.

These people have no interest in making the big buck off one visit; if you live in San Diego, this is where you should bring your car. End of story.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dbffeaae9c59dd:0xfe7101bc54f79fd3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I am so glad I found this place, I thought my transmission was going bad, but after a test drive, they assured me it was fine.  Then they worked very hard to find what was really wrong and fixed it quickly! My car has never ran better! Thank you Matt, Ronnel and hard working team at Kearny Mesa Auto!< /Review>

Class atmosphere is great. The workout can be as intense as you make it. (This studio never lacks for someone to push you.) I’ve been really lucky to get to workout with coach Kevin, who has helped me cut 7% off my 200m row and 1 minute off my mile time over the past year.
—-OTF in general: The HIIT format really works for me and I enjoy it very much. love the reciprocity program. With Orangetheory’s network I’ve been able to get workouts in Santa Barbara, Portland, Denver, and Vegas. It has been nice to experience different studio experiences in different places AND it is a great way to get a workout in while traveling.< /text>

You can workout OUTSIDE HERE! The trainers are so kind, talented and very accommodating during this crisis. The workouts always challenge me. This is a great way to stay fit this new year :)< /Review>

My FAVORITE studio, without a doubt, is this Orange Theory!
Kevin, James, and Emily all are incredible trainers, and they push you to hard to work harder. Everyone remembers your name when you walk in and they’re so kind!< /Review>

Amazing experience. Kevin is the best but all the trainers have been great. It’s a good mix of cardio and strength training. No masks required outside which is so nice. So much better than trying to workout on your own. It’s like having a personal trainer.< /review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Always great to get an OT workout in while on the road. The studio was nice and well-maintained, but it felt a little impersonal. In every other OT I've ever gone to, the coach comes out and welcomes the class beforehand, gives them an overview of the workout (including the focus), and then everyone goes in together. In this studio, as soon as one class ends, the next class just sort of meanders in and the coaches don't offer any sort of group welcome. That being said, the coaches were definitely on their game and great and offering pointers and motivating during the workout.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The OTF Newport Team has created an environment that is supportive for everyone that comes. From the first smile at the desk to the final "Have a nice day", the team and coaches really care and take an interest in the members. I LOVE the workouts. They are the best and combined with the HR monitors, I really understand what the goals/ focus of each workout and how to gauge it.</Text>

<text>All of the instructors whose classes I’ve taken are awesome, and I frequent Julian and Sara‘s classes. They are really great with helping me with modifications for any injuries/weaknesses. I love the mix of interval cardio and weight training. It has changed my body more quickly than any other workouts I’ve ever done. I have less body fat and more muscle mass these days.
The front desk is also very knowledgeable and helpful.< /text>< date>

Was in town on vacation and went to the Newport Beach location of OrangeTheory Fitness. I’m a power walker, and since I’m visually impaired, I could not read the workout which was on the slip of paper taped to the treadmill. I was the only power walker in the class and the coach, Julian, didn’t call out what I needed to do. I jumped off the treadmill and tracked him down and asked him what I needed to do. He kept on referring to the slip of paper (which I couldn’t read). I was getting frustrated and upset that he wasn’t communicating effectively with me. After some back and forth, I finally understood what I needed to do and was able to continue with the workout. I know I’m in the minority being a power walker, but also being visually impaired and unable to read the slips of paper taped to the treadmill, coaches need to be more responsive to folks like me. Other than that, the studio was clean and the front desk staff were very welcoming.< /text>

Orangetheory workouts are different every day and I never know what to expect! Even on the days that I'm dragging myself in, I leave proud that I put in a great effort.  The coaches do a great job in creating a motivating environment by having fun music, sharing tips on form, and encouraging you along the way.

I can't say enough good thing about the coaches and front desk staff; they all are so friendly and happy to have you there.<//Review>

Best 60 min strength and cardio interval training you’ll get!
This particular location isnt my home studio but if they had the option to allow a second home studio, I’d definitely pick the Newport location.
Front desk staff is friendly and helpful and I’ve only taken classes with two of their coaches at this location which are Coaches Kevin and Courtney who are just awesome.< /Text>

<text>I have engaged in a high level of fitness activities for more than 30 years, including marathon and ultra marathon training.  But nothing I've previously done has provided the results I'm enjoying through my training at OTF Newport Beach.  And if that wasn't enough I'm loving the process; the workouts, the trainers and the members create an atmosphere that is unmatched.  I urge you to try it.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I love it. I hate running but, I find myself pushing to get better all the time! It's weird really. It's more like sprints so, right when you feel like you're gonna die you get to walk! It's the greatest thing ever!!<//text>

<Review>Mission Viejo OTF:  Was disappointed with pre-purchase policy. I was told they expired after a year. How does it expire?  I am sure if I still had the money I paid in my pocket it would still be good.  Poor policy...now I tell people my unhappy story instead of the good one I originally posted.  Hope you rethink that type of situation. I might have referred a few people and provide happy customer experience instead. Was only about 4 classes. Do the math OTF. That is some costly negative PR.  This was at the Mission Viejo location.< /Review><UserId.>100076438006466282492</UserId.>< Pics>

In one hour I get the best workout, feel awesome at the end and cannot wait to come back.  It is a really diverse workout so you don't get bored.  You are pushing it on the treadmill for about 20 minutes (interval training), then doing super fun, very challenging strength workouts with intervals on the rowing machine.  Great music, small classes, high energy instructors and a friendly but competitive vibe.  I have tried a lot of workouts and this is my all time fav so far.  I have been to Yas, Pilates, Daily Method, Spinning, Zumba...you name it.  And I do triathlons and run a lot.  This is such a great workout for athletes and non-athletes alike.< /Text>< pics>

Love to work out here, but I'm disappointed with the clerk and the management I stop coming for three months and they still kept charging my credit card soon as I found out
And complain to get my money back nothing
Guys if you decide to go here make sure you tell them and sign a cancellation or they will kept charging they stiff you what a shame to the management</review>

Seen plenty of good reviews of this place while I was in the area that day. At first I thought it wasn't gonna be enough even the after the fact I ordered the LARGE size bowl. But afterwards I full enough that I couldn't drink all the broth soup juice and it tasted pretty good. Good enough to go back when I'm passin through again.

My favorite Pho in the area. Incredible flavors. The shrimp spring rolls are fantastic & the vermicelli dishes equally great. Simple interior, but I’m there for the great food, not the atmosphere. Fun for a jeans & t-shirts family dinner or for a group of friends who just want to get their pho on. So good.< /text>

Fresh, vibrant greens & sprouts accompany delicious, hot broth soups. High marks for value, nutrition and service. I come away feeling re-energized in a relaxed way. Go here to enjoy sensible, welcoming community over a bowl or dish of fantastic, satisfying, delicious food. See you tomorrow!<//Text>

Great taste, Ok prices and nice staff. However I was quite disappointed with the meal when I got the PHO home and realized I had a huge pile of rice noodles and barley any meats. Good thing I like rice noodles but I still feel a little screwed with the overall meal.<//Review>

This is my go to spot if I'm hungry. Been to a many noodle houses in the bay and Valley, but there are only a handful that have a very distinct flavor to their  soup and here being one of them. Try it out its good, trust me.</Text>

<Text>This place is a neat hidden spot for Hayward.  Solid and relatively large amounts of pho for a reasonable price.  The service is just fine, sometimes gotta wave em down if you're seated around the bend (their seat-in is L shaped) but they're quick to assist you once you have their attention.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808f917905d63095:0x327de34cfa7c13d5</GmapID></record>

Came here with 3 of my mates after a crazy rager. Friends ordered pho while I ordered a rice plate. Food was nothing to talk home about and my friends said the same about their pho as well. Friend also ordered a honey dew shake that took exceptionally long. Won't be coming back here again.< /text>

Decent pho for hayward, perfect recovery food for those drunken nights and cold evenings.  Their chicken pho is tasty and they have a big tv in the middle usually playing football on sundays.  Wooot!<//review>

We needed our first smog check for our vehicles this year and having not been through the process we weren’t sure what to expect, especially as it was a star certified test that was needed.  The folks here made everything super easy. They explained what we needed to do, checked the paperwork and were able to deal with us strait away. We got an eta for completion and were able to go for a walk in Dry Creek Park across the road. Our vehicles passed without issue but they still took time to explain the paperwork and the fact that they had submitted the results to the DMV but to give it 24 hours. The cost was what I expected for the star cert and the cars were treated with care and respect. I absolutely would use this service again for my vehicles. Thank you for the great service< /review>

<Text>I received a smog test for an out of state vehicle, which I needed to complete an initial registration. Service was fast, friendly, and professional at a great price. Even though I was 'in-and-out', I definitely felt like I was being treated like a person at this business and not just a number. I will do business here again, and I have no problem recommending Union City Smog Check to anyone.< /Text>< time>

<Review>Best of the best in the union city area. Customer service is barnone the best I've seen. I was offered a bottle of water during the application process. Before having my car hook into the machine. Andrew is the owner of the place a young man taught well obviously by his elders. Great business ethics, and very knowledgeable not to mention transparent. Need a smog with great customer service and quick service? Go see Andrew he never dissappoints!. Kudos Andrew you are a Rare commodity to the community. Keep up the great 💪</Review>< pictures>

<review>I have an older car and 2 other smog stations just turned me away, since it requires more work to inspect. Andrew was the only one in the area who knew how to properly inspect the car and was willing to put extra work in. He’s very professional and has excellent customer service.</review>< pictures>

Really a relief to come across an honest, professional smog station. He is prompt and informative, and meticulous when it comes to.smogging your car. He tends to each customer with poise, and respect. Andrew Domingo is a  ery honest smogg technician. I highly recommend this smogg station whenever you need it done. Be here early and on time. You will be in and out.

Thanks Andrew,

For guiding me on how to get my car to pass.smog.

Well done kind sir. 🙏🙏🙏< /Review>

Just tried going here on a Saturday at 9am and they weren't open. Waited 45 minutes and still no one showed up. Ended up leaving after waiting that long.

Word of advice, call in advance and make sure they're open.<//Review>

I am so happy a friend recommended this office. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They’re patient to my needs and questions. I came in for an exam and teeth cleaning, Shelly is AMAZING! She was awesome and thorough with cleaning each and every single one of my tooth. Dr. Hsiao was honest and answered all my questions to help me get a better understanding of what needs to be done and affordable. First dentist I am comfortable coming to from now on.< /review>

I’m so blessed to have such honest and big hearted Doctors! ❤️ They really care about their patients and their work. Most offices won’t have openings until months later when you call in regards to pain. Not here!

<Text>Amazing service, great care and best dentist you could ever have!
Dr. Hsiao is always very patient to answer all my concerns and questions. He is very gentle and detail at taking care of the patients. With his professional help, my family and I are all in good hands.

Going to dentist is never a pleasure experience but they make it as easy as they can for you.
It is a warm friendly environment and it definitely helps me relaxed and feel comfortable.

If you are looking for a dentist, I highly recommend you to go for Dr. Hsiao! They know how to make their patients smile :)<//Text><rate>5</rate><UserId.>101116439172535603741</UserId.>< GmapID>

Was very nervous about wisdom teeth removal. Dr. Hsiao was very professional and reassured me there was nothing to worry about. I would recommend for anyone especially people who get nervous when seeing the dentist.</Review>

Best experience I ever had in any dental place !!! I went in to remove my teeth and to get new set of dentures. They did a great job !!  The staff, are very friendly and humorous, they listen very well to any problem you have, make sure you are comfortable, and mostly, make sure there is little or no pain to you. The entire staff and Dr.'s are great and caring !!< /Review>

This place deserves ALL the support and ALL the love they can get! They were SO incredibly accommodating and welcoming! 10/10 on customer service, ESPECIALLY from the young male dental technician(I think that's what they're called at least...) that took my x-rays and did most of the cleaning! If I could, I'd recommend that young man get a raise and/or promotion! He was so welcoming and friendly that it felt like I'd just reconnected with a highschool friend I'd lost contact with! Some ignorant people would try to criticize him as "unprofessional" due to his laid-back demeanor with me, but that's actually what endeared me to him so much more! He wasn't afraid to treat/talk to me like a real human and didn't feel the need to act like some "profession-bot 3000." The technician was so chill and polite; I really appreciated it. I wish I'd found this dentist office sooner, because the employees here, including the sweet-hearted/helpful receptionists & dentists themselves, deserve to be super successful! I liked and appreciated that the young dental technician's boss/coworkers didn't breath down his neck nor make him cover up his tattooed arms, cuz his appearance and demeanor helped calm me and put me at ease; I really can't stand pretentious, uber-professional businesses nor people. Granted, I want professionalism like any other customer/client expects(which everyone in the office displayed flawlessly), but the workplace doesn't need to be soulless and without character in order to accomplish that. He was so disarming and easy to talk to that I genuinely don't mind going back to this dentist, and I normally HATE going to the dentist! So thank you to ALL of the employees at this dentist's office! I look forward to being a loyal, satisfied supporter of yours for the foreseeable future!<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Hsiao and Dr. Lin are amazing!! I had a great experience at their clinic. I am always afraid of going to the dentist, but I felt totally relaxed at Dr. Hsiao’s because I know I’m in good hands. I have seen both doctors, and both had been very kind, meticulous, and caring. Two thumbs up!</Review></record>

I've had the greatest experience with Dr. Hsiao. I am so happy to have a dentist who is honest and caring. Dr. Hsiao explains everything  before he does it and only performs necessary procedures. Recently, I was experiencing severe tooth pain and reached out to Dr. Hsiao for his opinion since I am out of state and couldn't go see him in person. Dr. Hsiao responded promptly. I've never had a dentist to go above and beyond for their patients like Dr. Hsiao has. If you are looking for a dentist who will truly take care of you, go to Dr. Hsiao.<//Text>

Dr Hsiao is nothing short of amazing! I’ve been going to him for about a year. I recently needed some work done on my bottom denture so I dropped it off on Thursday, thinking it would take the weekend. He went above and beyond, working on it, OUTSIDE OF OFFICE HOURS, got it back to me the VERY next day!!! He truly cares about his patients. He will do his BEST to help you! My son & I will NOT go anywhere else! He has my highest recommendation!!!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Doctor Paul Hsiao is truly not your typical average dentist.

There are plenty of dentists out there but there's only one Dr. Hsiao. If you had to pick one dentist to visit, definitely pick him, and you will not regret it. Because every other dentist will simply be sub-par afterward.

He truly goes out of his way for ALL his patients. He treats everyone with genuine care. He takes his time to check your teeth and make sure everything is done correctly, with detail during the checkup. Don't even mention the cleaning! You will feel like a million bucks after his careful and detailed cleaning - try it and you will know what I mean.

He does not try to rush you off or tell you to do 'additional service' you do not need. He's honest and that helps all patients save money! I highly recommend him, so if you are looking for a honest dentist that provides excellent service, each and every time, then check him out!</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Talking about dentist with best work ethics - Doctor Hsiao is the One. Graduated from a prestigious dental school - UCSF - Dr. Hsiao surely carries his knowledge and work ethics everywhere he goes. I’ve seen Dr. Hsiao’s works on patients and every time I am amazed of how much love and dedication he puts on his works. Definitely highly recommend any patients to him even my family!</Review>

<Text>My husband had a tooth fall out. This quack said he was fine "got the root and all". New dentist must have a better exray machine... Because the root is clearly still there. They also pulled a tooth without checking blood pressure.  If you have better insurance than medi-cal, maybe they are more thorough... but if you have better Insurance than Medi-Cal avoid this place all together...< /Text>< gmapID>

<text>Hands down the best Dentist in central California. Dr.Hsiao was gentle and attentive. Definitely makes going to the dentist less stressful than it used to be. He listens to your problem without rushing and explains everything in detail. I got xrays, cleaning, and 2 fillings done for a very reasonable price. He charges less for white fillings than other dentists do for silver ones. The office may be a little dated but don't let that deter you. This office provides professional work without hassle.

Staff is excellent as well and parking is ample.

Thank you Dr.Hsiao!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Wow this is the place to get good Ny giant pizza. Fair menu pricing. We ordered a pineapple pizza. It took care of the sweet tooth craving. Pizza was not to greasy. The crust was just right, the cheese was moist and not overcooked. Great value. Easy access off university avenue located to the right of Taco Bell.  If you miss the parking turn off University Ave, you can also turn right into the Taco Bell parking lot off College Avenue and then get to the pizza place.</Review>< response>

Terrible experience. Pizza came cold. I spent 54 dollars at this place and called. Customer service was terrible. They blamed me for the pizza being cold. Also took FOREVER for them to make it. Go down the street to a better pie shop.

Asked to speak to a manager and they told me I may have to way TWO DAYS just to speak to a manager.<//Text>

Hands-down best pizza joint ever!! We ordered a veggie calzone with pepperoni, the veggies were so crunchy and delicious. I also ordered a chicken patty to me Alfredo OMG so bomb!! It came with the square bread it was pretty unique! We also got chicken Caesar salad that was good as well. It was the second time we ordered from this place and it has been absolutely delicious both times. It’s a little family owned place so the people there are super nice and friendly. We will definitely be ordering again! And FYI  I normally don’t write reviews but this place is FIRE!!<//Review>

Great pizza place. This is my go to delivery pizza. They’re really nice and extremely fast. Obviously if you order pizza during peak hours it’s going to take a while. They’re a family owned business, not a chain like dominoes, so cut them some slack. Delicious pizza though every single time. You guys are awesome.<//review>

Love the pizza and calzones here! The staff is friendly, helpful and food comes out quick. Never had a problem eating here! (Original review 2019)
Edit: I used to absolutely love this place, but as of 03/2020 they’ve undergone new management and the food just isn’t the same. So sad because I used to love ordering from here. Prices have gone up too.<//Review>

<text>The jalapeno poppers were excellent. The garlic cheese bread was pretty tasty, too. The white pizza was just a little off. I couldn't pinpoint where it went wrong, but I stuck to the bread and poppers. Most of the pizza has been in the fridge for days. I'm not sure my boyfriend will ever finish it.</text><Gmap_id>0x80d9570065f80ca9:0x8faa426b9a8aa840<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

Pizza was amazing, made with quality ingredients and huge! True east coast style pizza, thin crust and just enough toppings without making the pizza go limp. Highly recommend.<//Review>

I love their pizza. Super affordable and taste great.  The dough is tasty. We used them all the time after buying our house during the remodeling.  No kitchen.  You gotta try them .</Text>

We got a giant pizza twice 1st time was amazing. Lots of topping lots of flavor. Second time charged me 6 more bucks to do half pep half Hawaiian and there was barley any toppings. It's hit or miss I guess with this place.</Text>

<text>I am extremely disappointed with the food and the customer service that this establishment produces. I ordered a double cheeseburger with french fries. I wanted to substitute the American cheese for cheddar cheese and to add pickles to my order. When I received the order the hamburger patties looked like something you would get from a McDonald's value meal. Thin, appealing, and unappetizing. There was no cheese on my hamburger, the meat was cold and dry and my order was delivered with no fries. I called the establishment and the team member there made a bunch of excuses of why it is not there fault and offered no compensation. Didn't offer to remake the sandwich. Didn't offer to send french fries. Nothing. Didn't even offer to refund the order. I ordered through UberEats and I can tell you that I will NEVER use this poor excuse for an eatery  again.<//text>< Pics>

I wish I could give them a better rating but the reality is that it was very bad. We spent $30 in a calzone and a chicken parmigiana (which was simply disgusting) when we could have spent the same money in any actual restaurant instead.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d9570065f80ca9:0x8faa426b9a8aa840< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Haiku</Name><Date>1476579106531</Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I ordered from this pizza place three time total this past month and the first two times took over an hour and a half to be delivered. The third time, today, however took two and a half hours and when I called in to check the status of the order they lied and told me that they had come and tried calling me and even left voicemails, none of which I had received or calls for that matter and then blamed me for their inability to deliver when the last two times I had ordered they were able to reach me with the same number and I had received the calls. The pizza is mediocre at best but the customer service is appalling to think that their first instinct is to mouth off at a customer who patiently waited twice as long as the expected delivery time before calling back to receive a simple large pizza. Do yourself a favor and order from a more reliable pizza establishment.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Tonight was my first night ordering from here and I'm very particular about how I eat my pizza and my order was completely wrong. Then when I called to tell the store it was incorrect, the cashier assured me I was wrong and the pizza was perfect and the driver mistakenly handed me a diet 7up. I will never be ordering from here again.</text>

< Review>
These guys are my default go-to for shipping my  wine babies. I like that they have the option to download the forms so you can prefill the box inventory and save a lot of time at the store. The box cost includes foam inserts which was recommended by the gentleman who helped me process my boxes. I was assured I’d get my tracking number by end of afternoon and sure enough it was emailed as promised. Pricing was transparent and service met my expectation.</Review>

If I could give them a 0 star I would, terrible customer service. The old lady who answered the call was very rude and unprofessional. She clearly doesn't know how to answer a business establishment phone call. So many restrictions placed on my simple package that it could not even be held at a location for me to personally go and pick up. I could do a better job at delivering your products.<//Text>

<text>First, I want to start off by saying when I shipped the items the staff was friendly, uninformative, but friendly.  This was the first time I shipped wine and was not informed of all of the rules.  Due to shipping rules, FedEx requires a signature and will not let you pick it up from a Hub.  So, if you are shipping make sure you take off work and are there for a signature.  No fault of Buffalo Shipping.  My issue is there customer service.  When I called Buffalo Shipping to understand the issue the woman was EXTREMELY rude and notified me of the 14 signs in the area about if there is an address change there is a $20 charge.   I had to change the address to a FedEx hub so I can pick it up at my convenience.  I explained to her I had no problem paying the fee but thought this would be something that should be informed to new clients shipping wine.  After giving her my credit card number, I wanted to confirm that I would get a receipt but unfortunately she just hung up on me.  I'm very disappointed in their service.

Their 14 signs need to be improved or maybe they need some customer service training.  Either way, find another shipping company with better service.

I really wish I reviewed the reviews prior to using this company.  1st the posts actually provide more information than the actual stores 14 signs.  2nd I would have went to another shipping company with better customer service.<//text>< Resp>

All in all Graton is a place to be for fun and excitement and a chance to win.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Great people! I went in to ship two cases of expensive wine, and the gentleman who helped me out actually advised against it since I planned on shipping to such a hot location (Las Vegas). He recommended that we check the wine on our plane, which we ended up doing. The cost was about the same, and I was extremely impressed and thankful that he was so honest with me.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmap_id>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Very bad service. We call here ahead of time to check how much it would be to ship to Maryland. The lady we spoke to said check prices online. We look online and the price is $42 dollars. We come to this place and the manager working tells us they changed the price a month ago and they never updated the website and now its 120 dollars. I am very unhappy because we wasted a trip to come to this place which we didnt even use, and this place refuses to honor there stated prices. Very unprofessional. Why would I look on the website for prices if the prices are incorrect? Very disappointed.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Provides many of the necessary materials requires for shipping delicate items such as wines. Can be busy at times with wait times around 5 plus minutes. Check them out before you finalize your shipment with others.< /text>

We shipped 6 bottles of wine from there on Sunday afternoon. They stated that an adult would have to be present to sign for it, so my wife and I discussed with the employee if we s should ship it to our house, to my wife's work, or to the Fedex store near our house.
The employees stated that it would arrive the next day; possibly the day after that.
So we decided my wife could be home to receive it, and shipped it to the house.
After working from home 2 days, which was an inconvenience, as well as a negative from her company's perspective, the wine did not arrive.
Calling Buffalo's Shipping, they stated that the shipper, GSO, missed the delivery and they would try again the next day.
I explained my wife had taken 48 hours out of her time/office to wait and the wine hadn't shown. I confirmed with my wife that she could work from home the next day, but would have to leave for a dentist appointment at 4:20pm.
Sure enough, the shipper arrived at 4::47 pm after my wife had left.
I called the shipper who's # I got from the 'missed shipment'  email I received,  told them what happened and I asked if they could send it to my wife's office at this point. They said they'd call Buffalo's to get the change authorization.
The next day I get a call from Buffalos saying I'd be charged $20 to change the destination.
I let her know it was the shipper's fault and my wife wasted about 72 hours away from working at her office waiting for the package. The least they could do is ship it to the office at no more charges to me.
She very rudely said 'no, it costs us money. If I don't pay more, it will be delivered to my house between 4 and 5 pm today.'
I told her what I thought about how terrible her company and that their customer service is terrible, among the worst I've ever seen.
Missed the shipment the next day, had to pay $20 change address fee and got the week 4 days after promised.
My advice to them is to be honest about when the package will arrive(3 days) so the customer can be there when it arrives.</Review>< time>

This company is terrible. We ship wine from Napa and other vineyards all the time and this company puts a restriction on shipments that do not allow a receiver to re-direct to a FedEx store/location. FedEx confirmed to my wife and I on the phone the restriction is put on by the shop. If you look inside they have a sign that says they charge to re-direct a package. These are un-ethical, terrible people that are in it only for the money. NEVER USE THEM!<//Review>

First time writing a negative google review, so I'm sure that says something about how significant the experience was.. Extremely unfortunate and disappointing customer service overall. The man in the store was lovely, and let us know that if we were not home to sign for our package of wine (which we knew we would never be on a week day) that we would be able to simply pick it up at a FedEx location (which legally, and understandably, a person over 21 has to be available).. When attempted to set that up, but FedEx informed us that Buffalo Shipping Post had placed a restriction on their package/delivery, and that we would have to reach out to them so that they could request a change in their "restriction". We called Buffalo shipping and spoke to the most unfortunate and rude woman, who raised her voice (never experienced that on this end of customer service), and who stated that we are responsible for an additional $20 fee to "change the address from our home address to the FedEx location"... She refused to make any changes despite their nondescript advertising of their "change of address" policy (no one communicated that to us at check-out when we specifically asked about a FedEx pick-up), and frankly she refused to communicate appropriately ... I would recommend just going with FedEx to begin with, as the cost in the end is about the same, they are easier to deal with, and they were only helpful and accommodating and delivered actual customer service. Again, my first negative review but I have never been spoken to so poorly and I would hate for anyone else to experience that as well considering the numerous other options in Napa for shipping.< /Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>this place has a pretty good rating so my husband and I decided to try it out. It was edible, but I wouldnt go there again. I had carnitas and my husband had lingua. The carnitas had no flavor and was VERY fatty. The lingua was better, but nothing special. It cost $21 for nachos and a burrito so it wasnt that cheap. There many places in Bakersfield that are better and cheaper.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< review>
I think this was the first review I did for Google a couple years back. Well I'm still eating here that should tell you something right there. I like the food very much. You get good sized portions and the food is good. It's always consistent even when I noticed it's the other cook filling in for the main Chef. Guess he needs a day off once in a while. Lol. I recommend the place. Keep up the good work.</review>

Been coming for about three years and still don't disappoint. If looking to try different menudos in the area, try this establishment. Like the chips and horchata.</Text>

Amazing that a store can blow the mind of any genre of music lover.  My second time back, I could  have easily spent a paycheck here but limited myself to 15 extremely rare, out of print, not even available on amazon.com recordings of rare items that I have been looking for for years.   Is there anywhere else like this on the planet?  Worth a trip all in itself.< /Text>

My son will be starting HS this fall.  As a physician / former high school teacher who appreciates a teacher who installs and insists on excellence, I was very impressed by our first meeting when Mr. Brad Davis spoke to us regarding his expectations from parents and students.  Being impressed by his professionalism and knowledge, it was natural for me to ask him where my son and I should go to have his trumpet inspected, cleaned....  Without hesitation he and 4 parents who overheard our conversation simultaneously stated, "Imperial Band off of Imperial Highway"!  I googled the location and my first thought was, "30 minutes away?????"   Trusting the excited recommendation I drove from my home in Yorba Linda past several music stores wondering why I was recommend to travel this far.
It was obvious the minute I walked in.  I had them evaluate my child's trumpet he had been using for the past 5 years without us ever knowing we had to take it apart, clean it etc....There was a lot that needed to be done and I thought I was going to be charged an exuberant amount of money (they could have since I had no idea what a fair price was).
They gave me a quote and I thought the owner was mis-quoted because it was so low.
I agreed.
My son asked the staff about his new mouthpiece.  His old was was peeling, so a few weeks ago went to a nearby music store and requested a mouth piece for the trumpet. The gentleman reached under the counter and gave us one and states that will be $63.49.

My son was never happy with it.  When he asked for a new one at IBI, the first question was, what size do you need?  We answered, we didn't know there were different sizes.  The IBI staff ( I wish I remembered her name) stated we should never by a mouth piece without trying them in the store.

She pulled out and explained the different sizes and had my son practice scales with each one until he found the one he was most happy with!!!

She taught us how to maintain the instrument daily and periodically.

Than we needed to arrange pick up--we needed it before July 5 which was my sons first sectional session at his high school.

We showed up only a few days before this and the staff stated that because the 4th of July Holiday it will be tough to be done but "let me go talk to the owner".

The owner told us he will have it done on July 4 th at noon.

We showed up on July 4th at noon and it was closed!!

I called the store and Jerry, the owner answered and told us he is in the back of the store finishing up on my sons trumpet and came to open the door.

It was than that I realized that they planned to have the store closed on July 4th but because my son needed it on July 5, Jerry came in on a holiday to finish up the work my sons' trumpet.

I was extremely grateful and embarrassed.  He charged me the very low fee he quoted me and would not let me tip him on my credit card.  He would not accept a cash tip.  He stated, "I am glad it worked out for your boy", let me know if we needed anything else to not hesitate to call and again refused to accept a gratuity even though I was so incredibly thankful for the excellent service, the going above and beyond the call of duty to help my son out with his predicament of needing his trumpet by a certain time.

P.S.  Not sure what "Jacobtoysabx" is reviewing???  I did quote rentals before purchasing a trumpet and the rental prices were lower than 4 other places I went to.<//text>< rate>

I cannot say enough good things about this place. they are very VERY helpful, and are more affordable than the "rent to own" places. the proprietor is very patient, and is actually a high school band director.  he helped my son pick out an instrument, and was patient enough to see how it would fit him. their purchase price is a good 30% less than other places.

Great place to stay at. Was here for 2 years. Yeah theres minor drama such as homeless and oan handlers...but you get that everywhere. As far as the drug usage....? Lol it was outside the walls. Staff and management are great...dont be ignorant...then you'll have a good seat in the grass field to watch a great Pixar movie in the summer time.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Rented a home here for 4 years. Nothing good to say about this place. I was so exited when I moved in because of the clubhouse and pool and gated community. The neighbors are rude. Several convicted child molesters live here. Check megans list! The HOA treats renters horribly. They target you and tow your car every chance they get, charge you fees randomly and they take your house if you don't stay on top of the fees. (it happened to one of the neighbors while I was there) The whole thing is an extortion racket. A whole lot of sad sorry people. Also never had so much stuff stolen in my life. Moving out was a breath of fresh air.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcadaa4ab57111:0x8992bdd4727efa6b</GmapID></record>

I went there to replace my battery, and my phone is dead the following day. Apple didn't even tell me that there is a chance of the phone becoming dead. The support people tried to deceive me into buying a new phone. I told them that the apple service center is responsible for fixing it if the phone was working and dead the next day. I'm so disappointed in Apple. Worst experience ever! Do not visit this place for phone repairs.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Relax you are in apple zone; Today I really experienced the true meaning of costumer service.  I was frustrated because it’s been a week since I dropped my beats headphones at the service department, and I didn’t get any response about it since then. After I explained my situation to the service department at the apple store. They start with apologies and offered my a new headphones and also they gave me a small apple headphones. Fast, easy and efficient. Thanks Roger<//text>

< Review>
I haven't been to an apple store since pre-pandemic. I was unaware you needed an appointment. I felt discriminated against as they were selective on who they allowed into the store without an appointment. A couple and I arrived at the same time and I wasn't assisted. I couldn't help but to feel that I was turned away because I was dressed more casual. I am a long time apple customer and recently purchased an ipad pro and wasn't allowed to purchase accessories.

The genius bar floor staff and the supervisor were both very rude. If this situation was handled differently I would not have been so upset. They should have staff available to help assist people in scheduling appointments or purshasing products online. There was zero customer service. They simply tell you to get lost.<//Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service! My father who’s an elder went to ask for help and no one would help him because he spoke only Spanish. They told him they didn’t have any Spanish speaking employees and were really rude to him when all he was doing was saying he didn’t understand English!!

Please do not go here. I came in to get my computer fixed and left with it home without looking at it. To later(couple days) find out that a key on my keyboard was missing idk what the managers name is but they were tall, white male with curly hair. they told me that they gave it to me in good condition which is a lie bc when I gave it to them there was no key missing. his evidence was documentation not even a picture just writing. I keep telling him that he was wrong bc he was!! He kept going back and forth with me about it then tell me if I wanted them to fix it is was gonna be $400+. They didn’t help me just damaged my property. Do not trust them with your devices. PLEASE don’t come here. I’m disgusted!!!</Review>

The service is excellent. I gave two stars because I bought a MacBook Air, and the camera was grainy. I was told by the service that the product is working as is. I purchased a product thinking I got a premium product but got a doodoo quality product, and Apple will not fix it. When I bought the Air, the sales person did not mention the camera quality. So please don't make my mistake, check the camera quality among other things before making your purchase because it is an investment.</Text>

Alex had great customer service and recommendations to which MacBook would be a great fit for what i do at school. Ive actually haven't been to a store lately with customer service as good as this location. During this pandemic, i really like how they take your temperature and ask quick questions about symptoms. The whole team was nice 👍<//Review>

I brought my mac pro in  for a overheating issue, per the apples support recommendation to take it into the store because maybe i could save money just replacing the fan for $200 instead of a flat fee of $500 if i ship it to apple for repair. so i made and appointment to bring it in, the tech  at the store did not agree with the apple support, he said it's not the fan right off the batch, no diagnosing test,  and talked me into trading in for a gift card,  and did tell me that after the trade in it will be final. On  the way home I realised that I just got $500 gift card  for a $2300 computer, so I called them right  back hoping if they still let me get it fixed,  and  they said I could come back within a week to have it fixed, I made an appointment a week later, I even called them the second time to make sure  they have my computer and that it's ok if I come in right on the 7th day, they confirmed yes. On my appointment yesterday, they denied ever talked to me on the phone and and that  they don't have my macbook anymore, they gave me a case number with customer relation and said to wait for a phone call . I walked out feeling i just got lied too, Both Apple and the store need to straighten their act on communication to customer  and between themselves. I am very upset!</Text>

Well..... I came in today because my pops managed to delete the phone app on his i8+  No that's not a typo, he actually managed to delete something that is undeleteable lol!!!
I spent 20 min with a very knowledgeable employee who was scratching his head as to how my father managed to do this. Long story short he ended up having to wipe my pops phone clean and start all over. I was super happy with his service, after he wiped the phone he helped me set some things up to help pops not do that again. Great service Apple!!! 5 stars at this location< /Review>

Took my son's phone to be blown out. Something was blocking it from charging. Customer service was excellent & they didn't even charge us for the service. They also look, fix, diagnose my MAC computer right then & there no charge for them to look at it! It was great!!</Review>

Thank you to all the staff at the Oakridge Apple store especially Josh . I went in with my 2011 Mac Book Pro that would not turn on and he was such a terrific listener that we  resolve my problem quickly.  He was so personal!!  I have taken classes for my new Apple 5 watch and my iphone 11 Pro and all the instructors are fabulous and soo patient . Thank you everyone</Text>

<review>The worst apple buying experience ever. Called apple in morning to make appointment and got a 11am slot. Was on call for about 20 min, the rep took all info and I got to the store at the time just to find out they don’t have any reservation for me. Made me wait another hour on the phone to verify. At this point I don’t even want stupid apple phone anymore.

This place is a joke l, customer service is horrible. Go to some other store instead.<//review>< date>

<Name>Russ</Name><review>Apple service has just moved to dumb all over. Here for a battery change on an old iPhone 6. My appointment is at 3:15 but ran into a schedule conflict so figured I would drop off the phone early. I didn’t expect to get an early repair just need to leave the device early. Oh no sir! Pretentious Apple wont have any of that. I’m told no one can check it in and inspect it. What the heck is that! I’ve been through the routine before, they take it and put a new battery in then I get it back in 90 minutes. Not to complicated WRONG!

<Review>I have had good luck with walk-in appointments.  After you check in, they will estimate the wait and text 10 minutes before your expected appointment.  Go here first and shop. Least wait time: be there when they open.  Their location by the movie theater and food court makes waiting extra easy!  Recommend!</Review>< Rating>

<Text>Did not feel welcomed at all when I came to pick up my orders. I work in retail and I know how difficult it can be when all customers want something at the same time but at least say “ welcome in”. By the time I got helped I still ended up waiting another 30 min to get my product because they kept forgetting who’s pick ups we’re who’s. Maybe just a bad day.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808e33d5e09d498d:0xc55484e185ced019<//Gmap_id>< resp>

They said they would not take my iPhone because I replaced the screen and the button was a different color then the screen. So I replaced the screen with the original screen and went back there the next day. They still took the same amount of long time they had the day before. They were useful to me again though because they did buy my iPhone and gave me a $100 iTunes gift card for my old iPhone 6s+. They are always usually really busy so if you go there you will most likely have to wait for their service there's always a full store of people.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

Went in to buy a 7+ at 8:20 pm the girl at the front of the store said they did not have time to sell me the phone, even though it was in stock. Store was not busy! Apple needs to hire kids that understand basic selling. Someone wants to spend 900 dollars and u send them away. Complete morons.</Text>

Who provide the wait time for service of 150 min ?

Why don't have a good service center ?

What's the agenda and goal here ?

Helpfulness in front desk - is very poor

Back end workers are hard workers . 👌
Need some correct supervision.
Bunch  of folks who act  like geeks but apple seems to be Greek to them , just wondering ..< /Text>

On Oct. 9 - Sunday morning - my daughter and I arrived at the store at about 10:30, not bothering to check when it opened, we were early. At about 10:45, a gentlemen came out and asked everyone waiting to join one of two queues. One for new purchases and one for technical assistance. We got in line for technical assistance, and within a few minutes, we were registered and told that we would probably be assisted at about 11:20, but they would text us when ready. Right on time, we received a text, were seated at the genius bar and in a very short time had a replacement phone for the one that my daughter had dropped in water a day earlier. The technician was polite, fast and thorough. The replacement phone was not inexpensive - $300 + tax - but the service was great and we had a working phone in a short time.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I haven’t had service on my phone for 4 weeks. I went in to Apple to get it fixed and when I was told from my service provider that I should come in and get my phone fixed for free by Apple, because it was a callback model, they laughed then went on with what they wanted to do and restored my current broken phone to factory settings so now I have nothing on my phone and guess what, my phone is still broken because I still have the same model phone. Also I had to show up at 9:00am just to wait in line for an hour till they opened just to get my phone’s data erased for no reason.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Very poor customer service. Just to figure out what was wrong with my iPhone they told me to wait there for 4 hours and after 4 hours it took only 2 minutes to figure out what is wrong with my iPhone, and then again they told me it will take one week to fix it. I would definitely not recommend this place.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808e33d5e09d498d:0xc55484e185ced019</gmapID>< Date>

Went to have my phone fixed and although I unfortunately lost my camera roll photos, the man who attended us was very nice. If you guys actually read reviews, tell Chad he was very kind and cute :)< /Review>

Make sure you have a set appointment otherwise you will be waiting. I had an appointment but still had to wait for 15 minutes. But once I got to see someone my need, a straightforward one, was addressed pretty quickly.<//review>

<Text>I took my roommate here to buy the new I-phone and got the worst service in my lifetime. Why AT&T ? You are suppose to be the best. We left sprint for you, and this is what we get. The youngster didn't help at all. He stood there and had me figure out why my account would open up to add my Roomey on my plan 🤔 I almost want to go elswhere. I'm a actually looking into Verizon. Thanks for nothing AT&T 🤨 won't refer you to none of my peeps ...<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Not as busy as the valley fair location. The 'Genius' that was helping me wasn't too knowledgeable on the repair I brought my macbook in for and as a result, my quote was more than it needed to be.

Ross thought it was a good idea to asked me to spend a discounted price of 250$ (apple care discount) to fix the brand new macbook pro that wouldn't even turn on when I unboxed it. Because the technicians saw indicators that it was water damaged, they assumed it was my fault and my responsibility to spend more money on something that I didn't even get to use yet. I told him if I was okay with a refurbished product I would have bought an open box item. I have never felt so scammed !!!! I AM BEYOND PISS AFTER SPENDING A FRUSTRATING HOUR AND A HALF TRYING TO JUSTIFY FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO AND LEAVING THE STORE WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT. ROSS IS A JOKE TO BE A STORE MANAGER.</Review>

Before I used Apple as an example of how to train my teams w Customer Service. Now, in all fairness there is many more customers and not enough customer service.

The very Law that set Jobs apart from the rest was The Law of Diffusion of innovation, which is now working against 🍎now . 50,000 reporters as the Early Adopters, who care, who listen, who are obsessed, now tell a different story.
The same Law will unfortunately tell customers what Apple really cares about and thats only profit and greed.
Is Apple remarkable? Is there current service system worth leaving a remark about?

It's disappointing.  Apple is more concerned w the profit versus the customer satisfaction.

I guess they can make this adjustment w twice as much capital as EXXONMOBIL.

Unfortunately money and power has the ability to disregard the absolute system of Character.

I hope Mr: Cook can adjust his processes to take care of the customer and not the profit. This is what made Apple #1.

Mr. Cook? Do you have a comment?< /text>

Worst Customer Service - never ever seen such a kind of crucify Service- worst experience, I prefer not to go with this store.
They don't care about customers, they are rude and not at all supportive.
I am not going back to store.
Thank you Apple for such a kind of experience.</Text>

The materialism and architecture is Stunningly beautiful,

But for some strange reason the employees here think they really are geniuses.

All i can really say is i don't want to go back.
Id rather drive to the palo alto location 20 miles in the opposite direction then to come back to these "wannabe Einsteins"< /review>

<Review>I have gone to this Apple store 8 times in the past two months but my experience has been quite bad here. The staff is arrogant. I was in a queue and I asked a staff member if I am seeing something in the store in another corner, how would you contact me. He replied that we would throw your name out of the queue if you are not at this table. I consider it a bit rude. During another visit, a staff member rudely told me that we do not have resources all the time to address customer’s concerns. I have to go to this store as it is near my home but I will now start going to Apple Store in Valley Fair. I am indeed very disappointed by the attitude of the staff at this store.< /Review><user>108464124883408219376</user><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went to fix a screen on an iPhone for someone on fri, they said it was a 2.5 hour wait at that moment, but I could make an appointment to come back at another time. Came back for my appointment, they then informed me I had to turn off the tracking system and to make sure that all the data was backed up because they just replace the phone. Would have been nice to know the first time around, so I wouldn't have to sit there trying to contact someone without a phone to figure that stuff out.</Text>< rating>

I came here on 2 different occasions:

1. Cracked screen replacement- waited at Genius Bar for 3 1/2 hours. They said they had to put on 3 screens because the first 2 wouldn't calibrate.

2. Ear piece - I was having a hard time hearing anyone in the earpiece. The "GENIUS" told me it would be $59 to diangose and $159 to replace earpiece if needed. I took it somewhere else. Free diagnostics and they cleaned under the earpiece with a simple dust brush. If it was the earpiece that was damaged, I may have had it replaced for the price but some places wave the diagnostic fee if you have the service done there. That wasn't offered to me.

Won't be going back here again!<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>The service cannot be anywhere worse. I got an unlocked iPhone 7 plus last year, and surprisingly to find i cannot switch to any carrier other than at&t. The technician was very sure the device should be compatible with any general US carrier, and asked me to check with Verizon more than once. It's turned out the so called unlocked 7 that we paid with full price when purchasing can only work with at&t. The store manager was so rude that she kept blaming me for getting a wrong phone, and not understanding what "unlock" means. So, anyone who has any problem with their devices should avoid going to this store, since the top manager will always always blaming the customer for doing everything wrong, but will refuse to solve the prolem.< /Text>< rate>

Really disappointed by the service at this Apple store. The Apple "Geniuses" are unwilling to provide all the information unless you ask them questions repeatedly. I wanted to pick up the Forever Upgrade plan. I was made to wait, run around and finally leave without getting the device eventually. And this over 2.5 hours!< /Text>

<Text>I got an Apple Watch as a gift. I brought my unopened Apple Watch and asked whether I can exchange the band color. The Apple employee acted like a policeman. He said it's over 14 days so no longer can be exchanged. He told me he was going to go inside to check the receipt but he lied to me. He went inside to talk to his shift manager. And he came out with the shift manager accused me that I might stole the Apple Watch because I don't have proof of purchase.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808e33d5e09d498d:0xc55484e185ced019</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went to buy Apple Watch...waited for someone to come for help....then went to one guy who was assisting others to tell him that I want to try one Apple Watch and he sent me back to case to look more and said someone will come to me ... Waited for more 5 min... Looked around ... Many associates were hanging out at the corner but no one came to help... Some were walking carrying iPads as if they are super busy but no one came... Had to finally leave the store...I think ordering online is the best option as I always do... And one more thing it's not weekend and there was really no rush in the store... I saw almost 5 associates free and with no customers around.<//Review>

Apple Store Oakridge or the technician must be thief's compliance, I totally agree. otherwise, how come the technician didn't check thief's ID or name but immediately erased my laptop and let the thief go, in just 10 minutes, even with the Lost Mode ON?

the thief stole victim's laptop from the public library, then directly went to this Apple Store, then walked away with clean macbook, so easy!<//review>

But I noticed the iPhone box was not completely sealed like how they sold previous generations iPhones. It was just wrapped with some kind of rectangle plastic. I had a second thought but it didn't go down to my brain. Later on when I unboxed the iPhone 7 I was disappointed by Apple the first time. I could tell the box and accessories were not brand new. Then I booted the iPhone 7. It had hissing noise when I put it near my ear. The hissing problem was magnified while recording a video...that noise. Finally, I was confident that this iPhone 7 was a returned or replaced one. Apple, you really really should not re-sell the defect phones. I just miss Steve Jobs. I will return this semi-finished product tomorrow.</Text>< rate>

I went to the Apple Store at Oakridge Mall due to an issue I was having with iphoto.  I lost a lot of photos ever since I upgraded to OS X Yosemite.  After waiting for two hours (which is to be expected since I didn’t make an advance reservation), a technician by the name of Justin was assigned to help me.  I was appalled by his arrogance and condescension.  I admit I am not very computer literate, but this technician rubbed it on me with his impatience and body language.  He wore his frustration on his sleeve.  Everyone has the right to be treated respectfully.  A job like this requires positive interaction with customers, interpersonal skills, and empathy - none of which this technician has.  I was aghast at his behavior and asked to speak with the store manager who assured me that he would talk to his staff so such incidents don’t recur.<//review>

<Text>I came in to get my mac fixed. I was expecting that I would have to pay out of pocket for the issue on my Mac,even though I have warranty for it. I was helped out by Chris, who went above and beyond my expectations for customer service, and really helped me out. I was told the turn around time would be about 1-2 business days. The problem was fixed by the next day. This is definitely the Apple Store to come to.< /Text><response>None<//response>< rate>

One of the tech supports is really lack of responsibilities and skills. Not because he couldn’t figure out the issue of my IPhone, but just leave the unresolved problem to me. I’m so curious how apple hair these kind of people to work in the from line with customers. So rude and I’m very disappointed.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I returned the original sealed MacPro last Sat. with a receipt of this new Mac in a week to this store and still haven't received any refund credit.   The manager there last Monday constantly told me it's a problem with American Express Card and asked me to deal it with them.  So, I brought AMEX statement to their store and it was totally disregarded as not their store statement.  I've wasted so much time on this and become quite disappointed after becoming the poor victim of their transaction.  Hopefully, the new manager Chery will really take care of this as she promised Monday.  More to follow ...< /text>< pictures>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>A few suggestions for the Oakridge Apple Store:

1) Before you nonchalantly ask a customer, "what's your password?", remind them that their private data could be seen and used by others, including Apple employees. Ask them whether they've encrypted their hard drive. And give them the option to erase their hard drives themselves. You are the experts, so inform your customers. You can't expect barbers, truck drivers, doctors, and plumbers to know about data theft, FileVault encryption, two-step verification, computer fraud, and other security issues. Tell corporate to update your training if you have to. We live in an era of government mass surveillance, data mining, financial fraud, and FBI/CIA overreach, so it's up to all of us to keep our data safe.

2) Call back when you say you'll call back. Follow through on your words.

3) It shouldn't take 2-3 weeks for the AppleCare warehouse to find a hard drive that took them 2 days to fix. If it takes that long, then there is a problem with inventory control and supply chain management. Call them and push them to perform. Escalate issues all the way up to management if you have to. Change starts from within!

Just be more professional overall. You are the face of Apple Inc, so try your utmost to represent them well.<//Text><userid>113684544097196600867</userid>< date>

<Review>Apple = thief's accomplice?

Technician in Apple Store Helped Thief to Erase My Macbook Pro While It was Playing Alarming Sound.

My macbook pro was stolen in San Jose Public Library on 07/15/16, I requested police officer for help immediately and used "find my iPhone" to locate my laptop as well as "playing sound". 20 minutes later my laptop appeared near Oakridge apple store. I drove to this apple store right away and arrived in 20 minutes. I thought I would catch up with the thief and report to police, because if the thief seeking help from apple store, he must make appointment with technician, which ALWAYS needs long time to wait. However, the manager told me that a man just stopped by with a "playing sound" laptop and asked to erase all the data. Surprisingly, the technician erased the STOLEN laptop immediately, WITHOUT validation of anything!! My laptop required password to login as well as displaying my name on the screen, and it was registered with my Apple ID and password. However, apparently, the thief doesn’t know any information about the laptop, and most importantly the laptop was PLAYING ALARMING SOUND!! The technician here even didn't check thief's ID or name, just immediately erased my laptop and let the thief go, WITHOUT any sense of security and responsibility for customer. Such a weird thing just happened, I really can’t believe it. It  looks like this apple store is so convenient to the thieves, so RIDICULOUS and UNACCEPTABLE. I already reported to police and requested for a camera record release. The store refused me to talk to the technician for details, the manager said she didn't want the involved technician to be interviewed by the customer. I was TOTALLY SHOCKED by the whole thing. Oakridge Apple Store is always crowded but the thief just did the thing very quickly, no waiting line. I feel like my macbook pro was stolen by the thief and the apple store. This apple store don’t care about customer at all but thief friendly.

I have already talked to Apple customer relations and Apple Care department about my situation, nothing help. The whole thing is WEIRD AND RIDICULOUS, it looks like the apple store cooperated with the thief in a good way.

I appreciate if you have any comments and suggestions, and please share this if possible.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Went in the store to ask about upgrade on my phones.
The first person that welcome me was nice, but not knowledgeable about the programs available. So she kindly referred me to a "specialist." In that store, specialist seems to mean cocky, arrogant and misleading. Not only was he not nearly as knowledgeable as he should have, he had a bad attitude, looked-us down for seemingly asking the wrong questions, with a belief that anything not apple was worthless. The only thing he accomplished was to convince us to start looking at Samsung phones, which after 5 years of faithful use of our iPhone, we did.
To top it off, as we later found out, that sales person bluntly lied to us about the programs available for AT&T so as to sell us apple leasing programs. I am ever so surprised at the difference in service level across different apple stores. The ones in Palo Alto or Stanford mall offer such a vastly differently positive customer experience. I also previously had a bad experience in that store when the iWatch came in.
I am guessing that in the interview process, when a new recruits is a bit rough, he is sent down to South San Jose. There is something about that specific store, so in the meanwhile, I go to either Los Gatos or Palo Alto...</Review>

<review>Went to the store and spoke with Derek. Showed him a picture I'd recently taken of the texting issue I'm having with my new iPhone 6 Plus (the text box disappears entirely- I have to close text completely and reopen to text back). This is the response I got:
"Nothing is perfect"; "We designed the application to close all the way so you could close and reopen it to fix these kind of things"; "You're lucky this has never happened before on all of your other iphones, it's just one of those things"
I had told him it's never happened on any other iphones (I've been a customer since iphone 4). I had even asked if there's a bug fix for it. Derek was not interested in looking at my phone at all. He never even touched it, it never left my hand.
Extremely dissatisfied with this 'customer service'.< /review>< pictures>

I had an appointment and came on time, but was ignored for around 45 minutes before getting help. Then I waited 30 minutes only for the rep to tell me to come back next week. I came back next week and had to wait again for service.<//Text>

Horrible customer service. I asked for the phone with unlocked phone and the guy showed me a locked phone with monthly payment with the carrier. Took about 3 hrs in the store.< /review>

Today I went into the Apple Store in Oakridge. I have been having an issue for the last couple months with Apple support. However Dave and Arian did everything they could to help. I normally don't write reviews however I think they deserved a shout out.< /text>

Worst Customer service I ever had in apple location, one of the employee with a name of joys or something like that treat me like a s....t he was rude , disrespectful and basically told me F... you , the worst was when I ask for his name he said it to me the way line he owns the store and telling me do wherever you want . WOW, WOW , WOW . I never thought Apple will hire people like him .

Hope some of the executives read this review and take a action because this location is horrible.</text>

I am so disappointed in the service at this store...something has happened because I used to walk in the door get greeted and immediately have assistance with any question regarding products or anything now I can stand there for days without any acknowledgement but maybe it's me...hope this changes in the new year because don't even get me started about the Los Gatos store</Text>

I had an appointment and came on time, but was ignored for around 45 minutes before getting help. Then I waited 30 minutes only for the rep to tell me to come back next week. I came back next week and had to wait again for service.</Review>
