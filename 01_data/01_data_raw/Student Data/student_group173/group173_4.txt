Completely Sketchyyy
Called to get a rate & evaluation on the phone I got a price range of $130 a month with a down payment or 280$ I show up to this place 4:00 pm to pay & the older Armenian lady said she was gonna finish helping the guy she had sitting down & then GO HOME! I couldn’t believe it they said they were open till 5:30? Told me too return on Monday where I come to find out they now want $350??? Waste of time & gas much easier just to go 2 rapid Insurence</review></record></dataset><record>

I was helped out by Mayra today at Freeway Insurance on Van Nuys Blvd. I was having a difficult time finding a place to insure my sports car but thanks to Mayra for helping me out with my situation. She was so nice and friendly and tried to give me the best deals possible.  She showed lots of interest in actually getting me a deal I am happy with. She showed great customer service and I would definitely recommend her to anybody looking for a good insurance quote or a good honest person to help them out !! Thank you so much Mayra and the rest of the Freeway Insurance team ! Go check them out !</Text>

< Review>
My auto renewal was coming up and I no longer wanted to stay with my agent. I looked up the nearest Freeway office near and this can nuts office was the closest one.
I wasn't expecting much, but I was in shock as soon as I walked in.
Lucy offered me water on a hot day and asked me how she can help me.
I don't like it when a sales person is being dishonest and I told Lucy right away, that I don't like BS. I need straight answers and straight pricing.
She gave me a quote that was half of what I was paying before.
I signed up right away and just wanted to share this experience with anyone thinking about getting insurance.
Ask for Lucy she is the best !!!!</Review>

<text>Says open 9 to 5 on Saturdays on the door, got there at 3:30pm to find a locked door, as I was leaving, a woman stepped out said they were closed, she is on her lunch break, and they will be open on Monday...  2nd location I've been to today. 1st place I went to had the same sign and was also closed, waited oven hour at that location, starting at 1;45pm on Nordhoff and Van Nuys. The 3rd is closed as well, a sign on the window says Will Be Back in 45min at Sherman Way and Van Nuys....  You get what you pay for guys, all I'm trying to do is pay my bill, and they screwed that up too... Would not recommend to anyone other than the most desperate...</text>< pictures>

Carlos Urias helped me today with a new policy that's half the price of what I was paying with my currently policy.  I was unhappy and super glad that I switched.  Carlos is professional, friendly, and cuts to the chase.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone shopping around for car insurance.< /text>

< Review>
Friendly and professional dentist. They use state-of-the-art tools for their cleaning. I’ve been going to them for over 6 years and have never had a problem. Dr. Cassara consulted me against having unnecessary cavity filling a different dentist (who wasn’t my regular) suggested; saved both my teeth and my finances! Plus they’re thorough with COVID screenings and PPE which is important given that the pandemic is ongoing.</Review>

Great team, efficient, friendly and welcoming. Olga was her charming self as usual. Plenty of vitamin E...on a stick! LOL! Joe was thorough but quick with his exam but not too fast to stop and share a funny thought and inquire as to my family's health. In and out rapidly, next appointment set, insurance billed and I'm on my way a happy customer.<//review>

< Review>
Dr. Picariello saved me. I am a busy physician and had a jagged edge of a tooth cutting right into my tongue. I couldnt talk, swallow or eat correctly. She came in when the office was closed and expertly fixed my problem in about ten minutes. I have never had anything but a great experience with Dr. P, Dr. Joe and Heather. I would (and have) recommended them to anyone looking for a great and well-run dental practice.</Review>

<Date>1534522643363</Date><rating>1<//rating><text>I was a patient at Dr. Cassara's office for about two years and left two years ago because I moved.  I had nothing done by his office other than exams and cleanings, and by the standard of other dentists I've experienced, I would say he is average.  The hygienists are average as well.  So why am I writing a review on an average dentist two years later?  Because two years later he files a collection against me for $141.  Not once did I get a call to say I owed any money, and considering I only had exams and cleanings and my insurance never changed, I can't understand how I could possibly owe any money because for the two years I went there they never told me I owed anything.  I've attempted to email and call and no one has been able to offer me an explanation to this point.  I'm left with disputing with the three credit report bureaus, which is obviously a gigantic hassle.

Moral of the story:  Don't bother going here because an average dentist isn't worth the hassle of him sending you to collections for money he never told you he owed you.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>My Son and I have been patients of Dr. Joe for more than 15 years.  He and his staff are top notch, very professional, up to date on all procedures and state of the art equipment.  My son was only 12 when we started with Dr. Joe, and I was looking for a Dr. that was good with children as well as adults.  He was wonderful (and still is).  My son needed most of his molar baby teeth pulled as they would not fall out.  Dr. Joe made my son and I feel so comfortable and explained everything; it was not a "rush" job, he spent plenty of time answering questions and making sure we were comfortable.  We never ever had any infections, or issues following any procedure over the years.  The staff and the Drs. work ethic and "bedside" manners are absolutely commendable.  Thank you Dr. Joe and staff for all the wonderful years and the years to come!!!  Julie< /Text>< Pics>

Worst detail job I have ever seen. Car completely covered in rag lint. Vaccum must have not worked. Never coming here again. The manager spent more time talking to the guy washing my car. Zero attention to detail. I recommend not. Coming here. Pictures below show minutes after they told me car was ready. I know it hot today, but this disregard for attention to detail is unforgivable. I tipped the guy but I feel like my money was stolen. In fairness, they did spend a few minutes trying to get the lint off, but inside looks horrible. Not recomended. On the plus side, they do have a large greeting card and ice cream selection.</Review>

<review>Great job great price . My car never looked so good. They did a great job inside and out on my car. I was very pleased to get a hand car wash and get the inside windows and everything cleaned and armour-all. $25 not bad.</review>< gmapID>

<Review>If I could give these guys 10 stars, I would. They are incredible and hard-working people. I'm from abroad. Visited them first time 5 years ago (they cleaned my RV after burning man). Visited them again this year. They did an amazing job at washing the exterior and interior of my car. It took a bit long, but the result was so worth it. Best car wash in the area. I highly recommend.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Tried to get an oil change this morning. Was greeted and told to leave my keys in the car. 6 men stood in the garage talking for a half hour. So I went inside to get help from the cashier.

Regular oil change service that's what I paid for at 8641 sepulveda bvl car wash
One week later I was replacing lower radiator hose and I  noticed that this people did not replace the oil filter they in fact flash just the oil leaving the old filter untouched
everybody knows if you ask for oil change service you're assuming that oil flush and oil filter is being replaced
Any way I ended taking my truck to a reliable shop for  service paying twice
I do not trust this place for any mechanical service
Car wash only nothing to say about it

Be aware of this place !!!!!! Keep your eyes open</Review>

A guy worked on my car cracked off my fender emblem.
I found out a few days after.
He or a manager didn't tell me anything about it and finished clean my car like nothing happened.
I will never go back this place AGAIN even if it's free.
Everyone be aware! if you love your car, don't trust worker in this place.
Try a good reputable Mobile Car Wash Service.
I learned that they do much better work and cheaper price than these Car Wash places.< /Text>

Today the Manger ARMAN told me to go somewhere else because I didn't  want to get my car hand was for $25. I wanted the regular wash but he denied the regular wash. He kept telling me that he doesn't want my rims and tires to get damaged, but I have have been the that car wash multiple times.
He told me "you've probably been here in your dreams"REALLY?? I told him I want to speak to your manager and he said "I am the manager, if you want you can call the FBI or who ever you want just get out of here and do it somewhere else" REALLY?? what kind of "professional" business says all these things. As a manager he should show a better example of professionalism. I will make sure I call or talk to someone about all of this!< /text>

<Review>Not going here again. They left my interior lathered with dressing. It was sooo greasy. They barely wiped down the exterior of my car and did a sub-par job in vacuuming. They clearly just wanted my car out of there fast. And they didn’t even clean my center console. I ended up wiping everything down again myself. What a waste of money.<//Review>< rating>

I happen to really like this car wash...The owners are nice and will offer you a lower price than what's posted. They do a great job on my Nissan Altima. Had a problem once where too much water shorted out my car, but they had jumpers on hand and happily jumped my car-FOR FREE...Reasonable prices. They also have a $8.99 special from Monday-Thursday from 7 am - 12 pm...<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c290b9ef21c5f1:0x9bd2698f9f489b46<//Gmap_id><Text>It is good place to get the oil changed. HOWEVER, if you need an actual mechanic DO NOT go there.

First, it is very very expensive. I know some repairs aren't going to be cheap, but this place is a total ripoff. I had them change the radiator, it was expensive. The worst part is that the car was leaking oil and water the next morning. Of course I went back, but Victor (who seems to be in charge although he is totally useless) charged me more to do something he was supposed to in the very first place.

Today, another mechanic fixed my honk and told me that the oil is leaking and that it could mess with the transmission (if the transmission is messed up, your car is done). All I could think of was abou how I was ripped off. I could have lost my car due to a faulty transmission.

Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT go there for repairs. This is a horrible place, it is not worth you time and/or your hard-earned money. I know I won't get these guys to really fix my car. At least, I am trying to prevent sometging like this to anyone else.

<text>The worst demonstration of what the customer service means,  I'll make it short , Friday afternoon I bring my truck for a regular car
wash , after that happen , Surprise: the windshield is crack in two parts, before car wash the windshield was perfect, the manager don't have primitive idea about customer service, they give me ridiculous excuses but no solutions, one star because I can't give less , obviously not recommendable at all.

< Review>
Only giving them 1 start bcuz I had to to leave a review.
First off let me say that their prices are high now! $16.99 +tax
Haven't been in a while. So I took my new car to get cleaned. They did vacuum my car good. I had to take it back to the vacuums and what do you know.. they never vacuumed under my mats! Then I look and see that my rims weren't clean. Then when I asked them to do that. They had an attitude , and say no speak English!!  My time waisted. Then I pull off and notice that my side view mirrors hahadnt even be touched!!! So I call and speak to a lady , then she switched me over to the Manager. He tells me to come back, but I can't! I've already waisted a lot of time with there poor job. I told him I would come back later on that week. I work 6 days a week!! So I just went up there and the Manager says he can only fix what was wrong and not give me another card wash as stated  per our telephone conversation!!  And if I want my rims clean , I would have to pay for a Detail Cleaning!? Excuse me... but don't you get your rims, hub caps etc.. clean when getting a car wash!!!!??? Smfh..
I'm done with they lazy over price asses!!!  And will tell my friend and family to not patronize that car wash!!! FYI. Your better off going to the WILD WASH EXPRESS CAR WASH down the street!! 👋🏽<//Review>

<review>So unprofessional!!

You know this is NOT a good place when everything is so overcharged, mechanics smoke in your face, it takes them twice longer to get your car fixed, and the mechanic who is old enough to be your grandpa asks you out when you have to go back for the 3rd time because they did not do a good job to begin with. Avoid this place at all costs! I wish I could give them 0 stars... Nada!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We feel it's crystal clear, but it's unfortunate you didn't feel this was the case.\nOur hand wash does cost a little more because it's a bit more detailed than our mechanical wash.

Consistently okay. Very rarely is there an amazing meal and there are some days where nothing on the menu is above a 6/10, but there has never been a day where everything was bad. Every item is consistently between a 4/10 and a 7/10. There's pizza every day and that's reliably good as well as a salad bar. So don't expect to be blown away, but it's never been too bad.< /text>

The De La Guerra Dining commons are pretty okay, in regards to the food. It's certainly one of the dining commons I like more, but the main selling point is the late night dining option that's available. Even if you aren't really hungry, going to late night is worth it because at that hour food just hits your soul instead of your stomach. Their desserts can be such bliss too< /Review>

UC Santa Barbara on campus cafeteria.  They served good food. They don't allow using trays,  thus we had to carry bowls,  plates,  and silverware.  This was inconvenient.  However,  a variety of food to choose was great for visitors.</text>

<Review>Largest dining common in UCSB; huge variety of foods including, but not limited to, pizzas, resturant-style heavy dish, taco/burrito stands and more. You can eat outside if you want to; would definitely go for dinner everyday.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The food is frankly subpar and the service isnt much better. Overall I feel cheated as s student paying for this service especially when other dining halls on Campus are soo much better. Go to carillo instead</Review>

I ordered an egg, spinach and mushroom crepe and nearly took it back because I couldn't find any egg in it! I found the smallest bit of egg white at the very bottom of my crepe -- they really skimp on fillings. The actual crepe's texture was nice but I'm still hungry.</Text>

Added chicken, bacon, tomatoes, onions, southwest chipotle sauce, and mushrooms, but they left off my mushrooms. It was conveniently located by gate 41, which was where I departed from. There's also restrooms close by. You can also get ice cream, coffee, pastries, and of course made to order crepes. I didn't care for the onions at all because they aren't regular onions and were very strong, so I'd leave them off if you don't want the whole crepe overpowered with onion taste.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808f779415af26ad:0xe40aedb970a80117</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food is fine (airport standard); the cashier was friendly but the other staff was not. I waited for a long time for her to put the crepe that was already ready into a box. And watch out, they might not give you the correct order. If you just want a quick bite, go for it.</text>

I’m back at the airport again, Oct 22nd 2019,  pass by this place today, that twice before I had horrible experiences with customer service.  I gave 1 star each time.
I pass and see different faces, so I stop and pray while  in line that they are nice.
I already feel the good vibe with other customers.
Right at the register  the cashier ( Sangita D.) was so pleasant and even gave me a few compliments , we had a short conversation. She is very nice.
I go wait for my crepe and the young lady there is also nice and let me know the silverware is inside the box.
Wow! What a difference!!
Very pleased with this company!
That is real customer service!
Will comeback again!! 😊

The food is delicious, but the employee who makes the crepes ( a lady with fake eyelashes and a tattoo  with two swords on her right arm is very unpleasant, she works like she hates the job, she doesn't  even look at  anybody when she calls out the number for the food pick up.
Terrible service!!

August 22, 6:30 am.

Here  I am again. At this location for breakfast at the airport before my flight.
I order a crepe , and a very short  guy ( the voice was a little feminine, so it could be a girl with very short haircut) , calls my number “ 159” and placed my crepe on the counter, and continue to look down. I grab my box and say thank you, he says nothing, stays on the same position  looking down taping the hot plate with something  as if nobody was there. I look for a fork ( it comes inside the box, I forgot), when I ask, he says nothing, pretends there is nobody  asking anything. Another employee “ Gloria” professionally let me know it’s inside the box.
If I looked weird, dressed trashy, smelled bad, I might would have understood his unprofessional behavior.
That tells me that from now on I will have breakfast at Dogpatch, just the next gate over.
The food is delicious at Three Twins, but I refuse to spend $13.27 for a single crepe and have bad service.</Review>

<text>I just discovered this ice cream on this trip to California. What a pleasant surprise to see this place right across from my terminal on my way home. Tonight I had the strawberry which is packed full of flavor. They also are happy to give samples so go ahead and try a couple flavors and see what you like but get something!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A good place to grab quick bite of yummy ice creams of different flavours whilst waiting to board. The seating area is shared with passengers who are on their way to different destinations. Prices are moderate given that it's located inside a major terminal of an airport.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Meh. Seeing how the company came from Petaluma which is near and dear to my heart since I grew up so close to this town and spent many-a-night traveling through, I had high expectations.

The ice-cream is good. Flavors... they could do a little better. The PBC3 (peanut butter cookie confetti crunch) is pretty dang good but even though the names of each flavor titillate you, the actual ingredients lack substance. The certified organic aspect brings new light to the message of what this company is trying to provide, but these days who isn't organic?

I think Three Twins can do a little better and get out of the box a little bit.</review></record>

Delicious savory crepe with huge portion! Highly recommend Crepe with Chicken, Mushroom and Havarti cheese with both roasted garlic presto and basil presto as breakfast :)< /review>

Probably the only freshly made thing in the Delta terminal. The sweet or savory crepes are pretty yummy. Nothing spectacular, but comparing it to normal airport food it's damn good.</text>

<rating>1</rating><text>I sat here waiting in a chair 3 feet from the counter waiting for my order for 25 minutes. In full view of everyone working. No one told me my food was ready. They just set it on a ledge in the back - out of view. When I stood up, they ALL suddenly start saying my food is ready, not telling me where to get it, only pointing towards the back. What a joke. It takes a lot of laziness to run things this inefficiently, especially when there are only 5 people in the terminal. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 And in the end, the food was cold and meh. 🤷🏼‍♂️<//text>< Pics>

< review>
At SFO Terminal 1, The crepes were great after a long flight, but the service was horrendous. We were the only costumers and all three employees choose not to serve us. One stared at us, another walked away, the third didn't move from behind the cashier. I was being polite and didn't immediately want to ask for help. When I finally did they told me I had to pay first. I think they didn't want to have to make the crepe.<//review>

I went to the t-mobil store at 499 University Avenue in Palo Alto and was helped by Samantha. This was the 4th store we'd gone to. OMG the difference in help and customer service she gave us. She was a great listener! Thoroughly explained our options and was the best customer service-sales person I've had the pleasure of having in the last 30 years. I highly recommend visiting this store and Samanta actually we went back the next day and the manager Ashton was a breath of fresh air. Its people like Samantha and Ashton that make going to t-mobil great. Thank you very much you guys(and girl 😁) for being you and making our experience great.</Review>

The store was warm and inviting. The gentleman was knowledgeable and helped me with purchasing a wireless charger, a new ipad, and helping me figure out how to lower my monthly bill.< /Text>

<Review>Love it, as soon as you walk in everyone will tell you the same thing, you can do it online, they don't care if you really need help from them, an elderly friend of mine really needed help, she doesn't know much about technology but what better place to get help than Sprint, your company right??? Wrong,  they could care less and they will show you that they don't care, is not like they are pretending to. I saw a guy walk in and an  employee with out looking away from his computer just say, "what's going on", they are not even trying anymore, they make you feel like you are bothering them</Review>< pics>

< review>
Today, I visited the Sprint store in downtown Palo Alto near Stanford Hospital. Are old j-3 phones are not holding charges and those batteries are difficult to find. Plus, I purchased 2 iPads 15 days ago. There try it out time is 14 days I just missed it. However their customer service was wonderful they gave me a discount that took away sticker shock from my bill. The young gentleman that worked with me for almost an hour in the store was so professional and patient. I really appreciate Sprint for providing such a great customer service Representatives. As a result, I will probably stay with Sprint for another two years or so. if you have any problems with your phone bill or the equipment that you get from Sprint they will back it up. I recommend them highly!<//review>

< review>
Had some trouble with a sim card for a nexus 6p that took over a week by phone and still couldn't get it resolved. Came into the Palo Store and Darwin was patient, knowledgeable, friendly, and fast. He figured it all out and ensured Sprint still has me as a customer for some time to come.</review>

They lie and say they will give you a discount on a lease and the rest of the plan will stay the same. WRONG! They charge you the full price for the lease and add a $40 NEW plan!  I have spent 1.5 hours with many phone calls over several weeks to try and correct their dishonest practices.</review>

<review>My wife and I went to this location to end our contract & the employee said "No, you guys have been here for years we'd hate to see you go. How about we throw in a FREE phone upgrade and a tablet." Naturally we jumped on this as we thought we were being rewarded for our customer loyalty. Days later we find out that he charged us for the phone, charged us for a whole new plan - that we didn't ask for, and refused to acknowledge this ingenious behavior stating that "It wasn't in writing." This store is down right deceitful & deplorable! We were shocked that something like this could happen from such a reputable company. We have yet to have this incident rectified from Sprint.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Terrible. Horrible customer service. There was a young man there with light eyes and shaggy facial hair when I walked in. I cannot remember his name but when I walked in he was on a cell phone obviously engaged in a personal conversation which was extremely loud. I waited about 10 mins until he finally stopped what he was doing to see what I needed. He then starts the conversation with "if you are not the primary account holder I can't help you and I'm still helping the lady before you". I left and was not helped with what I needed. I've been a customer with sprint for years but I'm afraid that after this experience I will not be any longer. You guys should at least hire people who greet you when you walk in the door.</Text>

<review>This place is the worst. Just tried for the second time to make a return within the 14 day period. Each time different excuse and no manager on duty to respond. Staff (both Donny and Enrique/Henrico) are the worst. Refused to call corporate, their manager, or do anything helpful to respond to the situation. The staff are actually the most unhelpful, rude people I've ever dealt with. I'm awaiting a call back from corporate and will speak to the regional manager about this.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I was a sprint customer for a long time until I couldn't take the poor treatment and the horrendous customer service anymore. Their customer service is not only just plain awful; it's also offensive! I mean, they went out of their way to attack me and, basically, call me a liar because I had a complaint. I was so appalled. Sprint as a company is a terrible mess. I walked out of the store and went straight to Verizon down the street. I will never return to Sprint. Among the worst company I have ever had to interact with. Top two, for sure.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<review>This review is for Sprint generally in the Bay Area; Sprint worked fine for us in another city. We moved to the area and found the service was terrible here (dropped calls, missed calls, very poor voice quality, and frequent "no signal" readings). When we asked the Sprint customer service about cancelation they directed us to go to a Sprint store in-person to get our phones checked out. Long story short, after hours wasted with customer service we canceled with a full cancelation fee. If you go with Sprint in this area, check beforehand to see how coverage will be for you. Be ready to either deal with poor coverage or pay a full cancelation fee to switch out to something better. We are now on Project Fi and it the connection is consistently very good.</review>< time>

< review>
Came in to have my phone fixed, had to wait for the "Tech" who turned out to be another salesman, he played with the kick-stand on the back of my phone (which had nothing to do with the issue) then brought it to the real tech in the back. When he returned he opened by asking me if I'm attached to my number, and pointing out that I'm out of contract and while saying my current plan is fine he implied I should buy a better one. Nether of those things have anything to do with the issue since I pay monthly for sprint total protection (which has been really great in the past, at a different store). I pretty much stopped him there since it was just a sales pitch and all I wanted was my phone repaired. He was still going at it to my back as I was walking out the door; from 15 ft away, at the back of the store. Wasted 20 min of my life. There are other service centers.

TL;DR
Went here to get my phone fixed, instead they wanted to sell me a new plan, contract, and phone. Rude customer service.<//review>

An employee mislead us into buying Smart Hub. They told us that it would be eligible for unlimited date and ofcourse we found out the hard way that it is not. Verizon has cheated us out of 50$ because we had to pay their restocking fee. Unfair and unprofessional.< /review>

I came to I bet store with 10 minutes to spare to buy a Hotspot since I do much of my work for my job on the road and when I was approached by one of the employees she refused to sell me one and told me I had to make an appointment to come in and get one even though I mentioned I really need one for work and I just need to buy it and that’s it and she absolutely refused!! Really poor service absolutely classless, by far the worst Verizon store I’ve been to, every time I go there there’s always someone who is extremely rude and sarcastic I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere garbage service!!!!!!!!</Review>

<review>I was came to the store to open a new line of service for my business and from the moment I arrived I felt unwelcomed & was told that I would have to sign up for my new line of service OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN. Instead I chose to take my business elsewhere. If that’s truly the policy and there was signage posted saying so I’d have no problem with that. The representative (Asian lady) made me feel very unwelcomed and as if I didn’t belong there. I would NEVER do business with this store!!!

Just left Fairfield store and was met outside by sales rep. She immediately made us feel unwelcome. We were there to have my protective screen repaired. Information was lackluster as was the attitude. She should have pulled up our account, but was treated like we were trespassers, which we were not because we never entered. No goodbye, just turned and left.

It was not just me who noticed, the person I was with asked me “did she make you feel uncomfortable, because that’s how I felt.”</text>

I just wanted to come in a grab a new phone. They definitely didn’t like me coming in 20 mins before closing and kept trying to direct me to online. The girl was obviously annoyed. I said I can try to come in a different time If it was that big of a deal and she said “it’s fine and all Verizon’s close at 5”. Could not even make the purchase cuz they don’t take cash and my card wouldn’t go through. BUT the Verizon on north Texas closes at 7 was happy to make a sale and took cash AND my card without trouble.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1597690020619, 'text': "We're sorry to hear you had a frustrating time trying to get help, Gienette.

<review>I switched from Verizon to TMobile to save money and a pushy salesman at Verizon wouldn't stop even when asked to. Kept trying to keep me at Verizon wouldn't let me pay off my device s to switch took hours and a manager to get him to stop. Later I had to go back to pay off one device with a credit from T-Mobile for switching and they didn't want the money. It took hours to get them to take the money and the only way they would take it is if I paid my sister's bill. Horrible store and customer service that cannot help you and instead will try to hinder you at ever turn.</review>< date>

On the day of the iPhone 5 launch, I was at a nearby sprint store in line to get the iPhone 5, when I got to the front they ran out of iPhone 5's. I looked at the mall, I went to concord sprint and Vallejo sprint, and even to best buy looking for this god forsaken phone. I almost gave up, but then I realized that Verizon has iPhones. So I went to this location looking for the iPhone 5, and sure enough there it was, in all sizes, shapes, and colors. It was the middle of the afternoon and Verizon was the only company that still had iPhone 5's in stock. We worked with Eduardo, he was very nice and fast. Thanks Verizon!<//Review>

RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE! Customer service here is a joke. They created more problems than we went in with and we had to go to the Vallejo Verizon to have COMPETENT people actually do the job they were hired for. Why would a company even hire such rude, incompetent people to respresent them??? If it werent for my contract, my experience in this specific store would have made me leave this company. Very VERY VERY unhappy. Very. We had to go to a branch in a neighboring city just to have someone fix what these rude and incompetent employees messed up. I'm still stuck at the rudeness. Just walking in the door we were made to feel as if we had ruined the employees lives. Literally that's all it took....walking in. The brown haired girl was not as rude as the black guy was, she just seemed tired and obviously didn't want to be there which made us uncomfortably awkward. But that guy....rude much? All we were doing was an upgrade lol we need to upgrade to a better company apparently.

To be fair, I will return next month to get the screen protectors I forgot and see if they can pretend that customers walking through the door aren't carrying a disease. We'll see .< /review>

Their workers are terrible and you'll be waiting in there forever with how slow the employees iPads are and how many times they have to restart them. The girl helping us told us our phone would be here over night. She entered in the wrong info placing so order so now we're waiting a week because of her mistakes. I will not go back to this store.<//review>

The service reps here are ok but the service I get from Verizon is suspicious in a matter that I’m constantly getting overcharged and need to go to this store to get it corrected.
What’s funny is they  keep trying to sell me Verizon for my businessI and  with examples like this I’d be a fool to use them for my business< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Drink were made super fast and the staff in the back were super nice but the lady at the register didn't want to give me info on cup sizes or flavors of sweeteners. I never felt like I was bothering someone at a Starbucks. Every Starbucks I have been to gives me more info then I even ask for.
Would be 5 stars without that register lady.<//Review>

Extremely bad customer service👎👎👎I waited for over 15 minutes in line to end up getting told (I could not have a confirmation receipt of my package being send). I explain to the cashier clerk that I have done it before another post office locations and she replied by stating... well go to the location then. We do not provide confirmation receipt package. Had to drive to another post office location about 15 minutes to be able to receive a confirmation receipt of my package. If you can avoid this post office is worth driving the extra time.  The other location was very quick, I waited a couple of minutes in line to be help and I was provided with the confirmation receipt package send.< /review>

I used to be able to ship my items at any time now the last box is at 3:00pm. They sent me to another post office. What a waste of time, not okay when online it says they close at 5pm< /review>

I called to let them know they are sending my package to the wrong address just to hold it and I'll  pick up and she said no so basically they want to give free merchandise to ppl . She said the post man won't deliver it if I don't live there but yet it's out for delivery for today. Wow .  Iv had many many issues with that post office in the past when I lived in the area. They should at least replace the manager  maybe then this office will be more decent.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>The worst and I mean the worst customer service ever. They are rude to the Hispanic customers extremely rude and disrespectful. The manager lets the employees run all over him. Never in my life have I ever been treated so poorly by a business or company. It makes me extremely sad and to see Hispanic people treated so badly. These people are very rude very mean to elderly people. One day they were yelling at my elderly mother and I had to go inside it makes me so very sad.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c8608a6150cb:0x9e21a2ce1a1fe1e8</gmapID></record>

<Text>I didn't say anything because I'm not the confrontational type, BUT i was really bothered by the fact that the clerk was NOT wearing a mask. Sure there's Plexi glass between them and customers, BUT transactions occur all the time (handling of money, stamps, envelopes, receipts, packages, money orders, etc)  i didn't even feel comfortable grabbing my receipt because I didn't want to risk exposure ( her breathing on my receipt) i left it behind.</Text>< pictures>

USPS is doing the best they can dealing with the major changes put in place over the past few months.
Don't blame USPS itself for the actions of DeJoy, the president, and the Republican Party. THEY cut their hours and removed their mail sorting machines. USPS is doing the best they can keeping up with the changes forced upon them. Don't blame USPS, these are the repricussions due to the actions of President Trump. He's to blame for the slow mail.< /Text>

<Review>WHAT A SERVICE FROM USPS PEOPLE. I AGREE WITH  THE COMMENTS OF OTHERS SAYING THAT THEY ARE BEING PAID WITH MY TAXES. MY PACKAGE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE DELIVER IN 10 DAYS AND THEY KEEP SAYING THAT NO SAFE LOCATIONS ARE FOUND TO DROP THE PACKAGE. OUR BUILDING HAS  ITS OWN MAILBOXES. I MA NOT SURE IF THESE ARE NOT SAFE FOR THEM AND EVERY TIME I CALL THEY SAY THAT ITS ON DRIVERS CONSIDERATION TO LEAVE IT OR NOT. I DO BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY< /Review>< username>

First of all you don't ask a customer if they have a question you tell them professionally "how may I help you"...this isn't the welfare office! And you don't question them either like being interrogated like the police!
My mail wasn't even at this office & the girl wrote down a number telling me to call it and I couldn't even understand the numbers she wrote down.
USPS you need to train your people again how to have customer service and be more professional. I won't ever deal with this office again!<//Review>< Pics>

I am a pwrson that normally does not give bad reviews but seems like this will be a rare ocassion. The staff has a rude attitude towards cliemts. I sent a package to LA around their area and the person i sent the package to never recieved their package. When i informed them they should had gotten it on Saturday because i had paid for them to get it on saturday, they told him he had to wait for them to try again to deliver and that the person delivering had no obligation to call the client even though i checked the box to call, and she also said the delivery person had no obligation to go through a secure building even though there is an intercom. Now I am looking into getting a refund and the online service says it can not refund me the money. Next time I will use UPS< /text>

You should really check the people that you hire, all she did was give me nasty attitude and said I couldn’t take it. Without any explanation. She was on the first register to the door, had glasses, and was African American. Customer service BAD. Never again. She should be fired. Went to a different post office and they took my package with no issue.</text>

Terrible service!
I went to pick up a package, that the post office left. A Note at my gate.
However when I arrived the clerk insisted that my package was not at the facility.
I called a head of time so I knew it was!!
Finally after raising my voice and getting loud and gettho.
They finally decided  to check in the bk!! And guess what?
it was there!!! :)

Not to mention the lady that was helping me was  the supervisor and her demeanor changed as soon as she realized she was wrong!

This place sucks!!!
I hope they firer them all!< /review>

Worst experience ever! This post office is in a mostly hispanic/ spanish speaking area and they have almost no-one speaking spanish. The employees are so rude and belittle the hispanic people that dont know alot about mailing a package. I have lived in the area for over 10+ years and nothing has changed, poor leadership its time for change...< /review>

Horrible USPS. Attendent refused to help locate lost mail that was last scanned at this location. Spoke to supervisor who was much more amicable but did not follow through with promises.

Appears they have a reputation for stealing, especially important documents and large packages. Avoid this location at all costs.< /Text>

This place deserves 0 stars. I spoke with an employee about the money back guarantee for a package that was delivered late, and she wouldn't honor it because the holidays (even though it's stated clearly on my receipt, tracking #, and both post offices i sent and that received it told me I could get my $ back.) She asked her coworkers, they were extremely rude and unprofessional and shook their head no the whole time i was talking. They offered the supervisors help, but she came out and did the same thing.. laughed at me, and told me no and walked away yelling and laughing with her employees. Very disappointing, I will NEVER be back.<//review>

<text>This is the worst post office ever. Every employee there deserves to be fired. They look so miserable and their attitudes are the worst. There is mediocre customer service here. The phones are never answered. They never return messages. My package was lost here. The tracking number showed it arrived to this facility and after that tracking was never updated and package was not delivered. Where is management in all of this? Nowhere!!!<//text>< GmapID>

Its crazy how innocent people get treated cause employees dont feel like working if you dont feel like working get another job you enjoy, they need to Hire more respectful people they are very rude its sad how our community deals with certain people everyone needs help when they are coming to the post office everyone have questions it doesnt hurt to just be helpful to others, they need to have a meeting on how to treat their customers and smile more when people come up to the windows, its always a angry response never a good one. its hard to talk to a supervisor,  this postoffice is very poor in everything that they do, need more and better people that would love to have their job.< /Text>

there were 4 working that I saw in the back.  you know what they were doing? 3 were laughing and joking in the back while 1 was at the window.  the 4 rude unfriendly dark creatures were taking turns servicing 1 window while 3 were napping. and there were 8 of us in line. and that creature barks at you when its finally your turn! meanwhile I'm trying to keep my anger in check cuz I NEED to send out my mail. don't they have performance reviews and some kind of quality control when they hire?  or are they blood bound by affirmative action hiring mandates?< /text>

<Text>Why is this place still open, dismissive condescending employees whom feel it's ok to dismissed our community. Shenna Walker supervisor  needs a  muzzel and her leash pulled for being so condescending and allowing her employees to do the same. Who do you report to Sheena Walker?   As a consumer I can take my business elsewhere.  Advocate for yourself in the receipt they asked for your opinion complain that's your right don't let people treat you this way. If they're so unhappy with their job they can be replaced too but we have to speak up.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<user_name>Sandra Gonzalez</user_name><Review>They leave the packages in a drop box with a clear door which is always overloaded because theyre too lazy to periodically empty this out. These packages are there unprotected and accessible to anyone which is how they lost my package. It never got scanned and updates never posted to the tracking#. The women there are always talking and joking out loud as frustrated customers wait in a long line. Once they do help you they try to upsell you on shipping services and they also have terrible repugnant attitudes. I sincerely hate this place. This place needs to clean house and improve cudtomer service because now there are many mail couriers to pick choose from which are efficient and effective.< /Review>< gmapID>

I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the customer service this facility has. They are rude and not vert HELPFUL AT ALL. They should change up the workers and put someone that knows how to communicate without having a bitching attitude.

I would not even give them one star!</review>

No star if i could. We placed a hold on our mail and after 2 weeks picked it up and all that was there is one piece of junk mail and this is after 2-3 bank card was sent out I guess they thought it was credit and stole them also small packages usually placed in mail box vanished thus place need to be investigated they're criminals.</Text>

The Service here is a total nightmare, the lines get very long and the window clerks are very rude and slow workers, they don't help you much and they treat you like garbage. I think it's time to change the clerks and replace them, for the time being I'm staying clear of this place!!!!<//Text>

Absolutely horrible service! Everyone is rude and look like they hate their lives and jobs altogether. They have worst attitude and provide the worst service. They do not try at all to do a good job. They should all b fired because they clearly suck at customer service which is a must in their job. I wish I could avoid dealing with such useless bunch of people.</text>

They are very rude and take forever while putting someone on hold. I was hung up on multiple times and then the lady tells me that there where other people ahead of me.. I was trying to figure out if my package was there so I can go pick it up like I have done many times and she lied to me and said "we don't hold packages here for people to come and pick them up" and told me to call a number that she gave me where they never answer the phone.. I am so upset!! Someone needs to do something!!!<//Text>

I really try to limit 5 star reviews to shops and restaurants that give a unique and high quality experience.  This is one of those places.  The chocolates are beautiful and the passion of the owner is abundantly clear.  She obviously cares about what she does.  If you have a sweet tooth or gift need, this shop should be thought of first.< /review>

I really liked this place.  The flavors blew me away and were innovative.  They have a really nice espresso machine and good coffee.  Not a place to hang out but I didn't expect that.   It's not even crazy priced.  Staff was super nice.<//Review>

I ordered take out breakfast from them and it was great! I only gave 4 stars simply because I don't know how the service is while dining in. But this place is great and the parking is easy.<//Text>

Absolutely love this café! Literally everyone here is studying sometimes there are people that come in who aren't studying and having conversations which could be a bit distracting but it's not often. When the music is off and everyone's it's amazing. Sometimes the music is on sometimes it's off. I prefer it off and the sounds of pages turning!< /Text>

Hidden in plain sight! Drove by this place countless times while enduring Venice Blvd. traffic. Finally had time to stop, and so I glad I did! First-rate chocolates with a focused variety of styles and flavors. Also not to miss are the chocolate covered nuts, candied oranges, and other treats. And finally there's good coffee and, of course, hot chocolate. Everything is delicious, and if you're a fan of the good stuff, this place is for you.<//Text>

<text>Exceptional chocolate maker. Everything about Milla Chocolates looks, feels and tastes luxurious. When I want to indulge and treat myself to something great, Milla Chocolates in Culver City is my secret sanctuary in taste. Don't get me started on their hot chocolate with its smooth texture that coats your entire mouth with silky, chocolaty goodness with just the right amount of sweetness you wish would never ends.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user>

<text>While I have yet to experience the chocolates, I just had a latte with macadamia milk from here. It's one of the best coffees I've ever had!

I think Menotti's and Intelligentsia are delicious and cool, but this is my new favorite LA latte.

BONUS: Their to-go cups don't make your coffee tase like cardboard, can be recycled, and are all black so I look cool while drinking.<//text><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

<review>Love the minimalist but welcoming design of this chocolate shop. But the chocolates themselves ARE TO DIE FOR! Never mind the exquisite packaging. Savoring slowly, they are the ultimate treat. My husband says he's never tasted anything like their nuts dusted with cocoas. Tried to give as a gift, but can't stop eating them ourselves!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I was fed up with taking my Highlander to the dealership, and my prayers were answered when I found TLD. Dan is the most professional, thorough, hardworking, and honest businessman and mechanic I have ever met. He explains everything and sends me pictures to show his work and support his diagnostic evaluation. Every time I take my baby for servicing, including some major work, my SUV seems to run even better. I can't emphasize enough how invaluable it is to have a reliable and efficient mechanic like Dan. Thank you!!!!<//review><GmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44</GmapID></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I was referred to TLD by a coworker after a horrible experience at my local dealership. The free oil changes that came with the vehicle were absolutely not worth the hassle and headache I experienced there. TLD was a total opposite, I dropped my truck off in the morning and received pricing and before any work was done. I continued to receive photos and updates all day of the status and was shocked at the detail and transparency of their business. I will never take my Toyota anywhere else, TLD was worth every penny and the staff could not possibly be more courteous and professional.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp9ag1_Sa4TskqBmdF0ECR2R649qWlYz6YW1tK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA8Shr6l19U8hqoWoBPmghmkuDFyXgEi3VXTbQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuoMVDoJOcflBNhIa46rK0hKJe2X89wV-HBhTF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBSgN4FcA-Wr6Vx_PPfwc2QBf9EQpeT2aahQrO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Dan and his crew at TLD Auto are the best, hands down!
Dan's a mechanic that wants to see your car last for as long as possible, he wants you and your car on the road, not in his shop with some repair needing done. He's also pro-active and not re-active. My car runs better than new, no joke! He went the extra mile to lubricate my hood latch so it wouldn't break, also sprayed a corrosion protection on my hybrid battery to make my battery last longer, explains everything he does and provides you with the necessary info to keep your car running PERFECT! I travel a lot for work and have taken several cars to mechanics and never seen someone so on top of everything. Tell me where you're going to find a mechanic that doesn't just fix what you came in for, but also prevents your car from getting worse?  Dan's the man!! I'll be bringing my Prius back to him regularly even though I'm not a local. Thanks for everything Dan & crew!< /review>

<Review>While driving across country, my Lexus RX350 reported a warning that my AWD needed repair. The Fresno Lexus dealer never returned my phone calls, so I tried the second company suggested by my Google search… TLD. I’m so glad that I did. I’ve never felt as confident to recommend a business. Mr Nguyen worked me into his schedule, repaired my car, and treated me as professionally as anyone ever has. I firmly recommend him and his shop.<//Review><name>Ben C< /name><time>1629915832382</time><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The AC in my 2019 4Runner had stopped working effectively. It was just blowing hot air. Dan did a thorough maintenance on the car and my AC is working again! He also provided me photos of all the maintenance he did which was really helpful in understanding how bad all the fluids were. He even cleaned my car. It’s the cleanest my car has ever been. My car is running great now and the AC is blowing cold again! Thank you Dan!</Review><username>Thomas Dayton</username><Time>1627061892345<//Time></record>

<Text>If you own a Toyota or Lexus, just call Dan and look no further.  The amount of knowledge and experience Dan brings to the table is amazing.  He has treated my 2010 Tacoma like it's his own and genuinely wants me to keep my truck running for as long as possible.  I kid you not in saying that my truck is in better condition now than when I bought it used almost 10 years ago.  I seriously wish I had found Dan years ago.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I brought my 2007 Lexus ES350 to TLD after reading the great reviews left by other clients. I was not happy with the quote for repairs I got from a Toyota dealership service. Dan was very helpful and explained to me in detail what services would be required, the parts and costs. He would routinely give me updates and send me photos. Never have I had this attention to detail with service repairs. I’m very happy I found this business and highly recommend for other Toyota and Lexus car owners to consider for their maintenance and their cars.<//text>< Date>

<Text>Very professional and thorough. Does an excellent job. Attention to detail is much better than the Toyota dealership. I will be going to Dan for now on. I have always taken my vehicles to the dealership and left feeling violated after all the fees and recommendations. Dan shows you before and after and his price is better than the dealership even with a coupon. Very happy with his service. Try it out. You won't be disappointed.

Dan brought it back to it"s beauty and it is a lovely car to drive. He has walked me through what i need to do to keep it up, and he is very reasonably priced</Review>

Even though I do not live near Dan’s service—I live in Washington state— he came so well-recommended to me (he is known far and wide) that I reached out to him for some professional telephone advice on my cherished 1992 Previa.  Not only was he responsive, he also gave me the expert advice for which i was searching AND not only was it comprehensive and correct, he never asked for a penny and stayed with me throughout my entire ordeal.  Dan really cares and is passionate about his knowledge.  If ever in Visalia, I owe this gentleman a huge hug of gratitude.< /Review>

We acquired a Lexus unfortunately by a death in the family .
We needed to do a smog to transfer title and the dreaded check engine light came on. Trying to find a place to take it to other than the dealer and found Dan at TLD Auto Service.  I sent him a message about 9:00 pm and I didn't expect to hear back until the next day and a minute later he sent a message back, I was stunned. He told me to bring it in and the would check it out. They found the problem and fixed it without the big price tag of a dealer. He kept me informed of everything they were doing and even sent pictures of everything. He made recommendations of what we need to do in the future and also sent more pictures and many tips through a text message. You will not find that kind of service through a big box store. He definitely went above and beyond! He even did a follow the next day to see if everything was ok.
This man eats sleeps and breathes his business.
They even washed the car. I will definitely be back and 100 percent recommend him to anyone.< /Review>

<text>The BEST SERVICE EXPERIENCE, Dan is by far the best mechanic for my car! My 2016 toyota hit 100,000 a couple months ago, it was due for maintenance REAL bad. I was really trying to save to take it in to dealer or find a good mechanic. I asked around and a good friend gave me Dan's number!
This man knows his stuff! But most of all he is Honest. This is so hard to come by. My car is driving so smooth just like the first day I bought it. Thank you so much Dan, we need more people like you!
You have gained us as your customers!< /text>< username>

Highly recommend TLD, Dan is great. Very knowledgeable and outstanding work, better than any dealer experience I've ever had. He diagnosed the problem with my Tundra quickly. Communication was very good and kept me up to date. Price was fair and he only uses quality OEM parts. You can definitely see pride in his workmanship and quality. Gives a lot of helpful info on preventative maintenance.

Also, Dan really goes above and beyond for customer service, which seems to unfortunately be a rarity in these type of businesses. After diagnosing the problem with my truck, he looked up info to see if the problem was covered under Toyota warranty since it was going to be expensive. Unfortunately it wasn't. He even put gas in the truck out of his own pocket, since it was low, while test driving because he was concerned about how bad that is for fuel system.  Will definitely be going to Dan for all my Toyota/Lexus repairs and maintenance.</review>

<Review>If you have a Toyota or Lexus, look no further than TLD Auto for service or maintenance. Dan is one of the most professional people that you will meet. He goes above and beyond on your vehicle and goes out of his way to explain things. He really does care about customer service and your car's longevity. I took my 2005 Tacoma in and was pleased with the work that Dan did. A bonus was that after Dan cleaned the fuel system, I noticed a significant power increase! I really can't say enough other than you won't be disappointed.</Review><rating>5</rating>< pics>

< review>
I used to take my Lexus RX450H to the dealership. I was really happy when I finally found a local shop with excellent reviews. My experience when I took my car to TLD Auto Service was just as described in the reviews. Dan is a professional, he’s very knowledgeable and does quality work. Dan has a heart of a teacher and described in detail what my car needed. The communication was excellent every step of the way (including texts and photos). I also feel that I can take better care of my own hybrid vehicle with all the recommendations that Dan provided. I’m confident my car is in the best hands of someone who really knows what they are doing and truly cares.  I’m so grateful of finding this place and I highly recommend it!!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I rarely take the time to post reviews; however,  Dan and his business are well deserving of this review.

First of, finding an honest and dependable mechanic nowadays is extremely rare.  Between my family and I, we utilize 6 cars; therefore, I truly believe in preventative maintenance, and have dealt with many auto services shops.

I learned about TLD Auto Service after purchasing a 1998 Lexus ES 300.  I purchased the Lexus for commuting purposes.  As many of us do, I jumped on Google and searched for a mechanic who specialized in Lexus.  This is where I learned of TLD.  I read the reviews and decided to give TLD the opportunity to service my Lexus.

I met Dan for the first time when dropping of the Lexus for service.  This was the first Lexus I had owned; however, Dan gave me an educational class on my Lexus.  Not many mechanics will take the time to do this.  Time is money!  Right?  Well, with Dan, I learned he also wants you ( the customer) to know the ins/outs of your car.  I left the Lexus with Dan for the completion of a major service.

The major service took about 2 days considering the delivery of parts.  When I picked up the car,  the first thing I noticed was that my Lexus was washed and interior clean.  The exterior of my Lexus was extremely dirty when I had initially dropped it off.

I stepped into Dan's Office and he stated, "Hey, help yourself to anything you want in the fridge."  It was hot, so I took him up on his offer and made a selection from various drinks.

Shortly after, Dan took me outside to my Lexus and went over the work he had completed.  I was sold when he showed me (and later texted me) pictures (before and after) of the work he had completed.

After a tour of my car, we went to Dan's Office where I payed the bill for his service.  Although I will not disclose the amount, I was surprised at the amount due based on all the work he had completed.  Dan took the time to explain each service completed.  I truly was expecting to pay much more based on previous experiences.  Dan's price was beyond reasonable.

As I previously stated, my family operates 6 vehicles, which not all are Lexus or Toyota; however, the vehicles that are, I always call Dan for services and he is able to accommodate me.  I ONLY WISH HE SPECIALIZED IN OTHER MAKES!!!

In summary, if you own a Lexus or Toyota, and are looking for an honest and reliable autoshop to perform quality service, I highly recommmend TLD Auto Service.

Thanks again Dan for your service!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>I will not take my Toyota Tacoma anywhere else. Dan is very detailed oriented. He is transparent about the work he performs on your vehicle and cares about you as a customer.  You can tell that he loves what he does and it reflects in his work. He takes the time to answer any questions you may have and will let you know the dos and don’ts of taking care of your Toyota.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I work and live in the Central Valley, I want to do business with local business owners. I research shops for the work I needed, then started to call around. Dan advertised certified Toyota Repairs and agreed to take my car in. 2013 Prius needed Head gasket and related repairs done. Other shops referred me back to the dealership.
I met Dan a couple of times and each time he was busy but took the time to tell me his plan for the repairs and showed me pictures of the damage I most likely have. In the end I received pictures of the work done, looked at the head before it went to machine shop , and received a vehicle back that is running great. I will remain a customer of TLD Auto Services, and look forward to a long friendship with this local owner.
Thank you Dan for all you did , Celaya family.</Text>

<Text>I own a Lexus and my husband has two Toyotas. Dan has worked on all three and we could not be happier. Much more convenient than going all the way to Fresno Lexus for service. He recently did a full clutch repair and tuneup on my husbands 20 yr old Tacoma and he says it runs like new again! Dan always uses genuine Lexus and Toyota parts. Dan will treat your car as if it were his own.</Text><pics>None</pics></record>

This shop has it all!! Service is superb and the shop is impeccable.  Dan is highly skilled, and nothing short of amazing. He is willing to take the time to explain and prioritize needed repairs.  I took in my 2003 Lexus RX 300; I am relieved to have found someone who is honest, punctual, and of integral character to take care of my car.   My car drives and feels like new once again!  I look forward to continue doing business with TLD team.<//review>

If you want your Toyota/Lexus serviced by an excellent mechanic, go see Dan at TLD. I took my Lexus RX450h to TLD for the 120K mile suggested maintenance and was pleased and delighted with the outcome. My SUV is 10 years old and has never run so smooth. Added to that, the price for this extensive service was less than that quoted by Fresno Lexus. I have every confidence that Dan will keep my Lexus running for many years to come. The place to go for excellent customer service and all your car needs is Toyota Lexus Diagnostic.</Text>

Dan is very proficient and quality conscious.  He looks to provide complete service, treating not only major requirements for service, but attending to minor details also.  He goes out his way to provide the best and most complete service possible.  I have taken my vehicles to many different auto service businesses in the past, but I feel TLD Auto Service has provided my vehicles with the best and most complete service.of any.  I am pleased with the service I receive and am confident that Dan has provided complete and quality care.<//review>

I have a 2006 Lexus GS300 that I’ve had since it was new. Numerous mechanics worked on it. Dan found problems with their sloppy work and fixed my bad alternator. He flushed the radiator, engine oil and cleaned the fuel engine system. His work was fast, clean and extremely well done. He founds other issues that were overlooked in the past and fixed them. His price was extremely good too.

I highly recommend him for all your Lexus/Toyota issues.< /Text>

Dan exceeded all my expectations regarding my Prius V that required major work done. The most important characteristic I look for in service is a sense of ownership. Dan goes into excruciating detail into how, what, why, when and where regarding the work done on your vehicle. Updated photographs and preventative protocols is part of the service. Dan is not looking for a quick fix, he wants a long term relationship with customers indicated through the quality and longevity of his work. I wish I could keep him as my little secret, but he is too damn good.<//text>

< Review>
Dan and the team at TLD Auto were a true lifesaver for us!  Our Prius 2004 needed battery replacement and Dan got to work on it quickly.  Dan took great care to keep us informed on what repairs would be necessary and was very upfront about the different options as it relates to price.  Dan took great care in fixing up our Prius and getting her back on the road quickly, affordably.  Dan has a great eye for detail and taught us a lot about how to get better efficiency out of our vehicle.  Dan went over  line by line explaining what was included in our bill and took time with us to make sure we were 100% satisfied.  We will be coming back to his shop from now on...I’m skipping the expensive dealership from now on.

TLD is the best shop in town for your Lexus or Toyota. Dan's customer service is excellent, and he truly gives you a dealer-like experience. I took my wife's Lexus ES350 to him for a brake job, and he did an excellent job - he even pointed out issues that I was unaware of from services performed by others from the previous owner. Whether it's just a regular oil change or a transmission replacement - he can do it all!!! Go check him out, you'll be glad you did.<//Review>

<Text>I was on a family trip to Sequoia National Park, when my Toyota Sienna broke down. Thank god I found Dan from TLD. He was able to take the car in right away and meticulously examined every single part of the car. He located the problem and immediately placed an order for parts from a quality factory. I appreciated that he had experience working with Toyota and Lexus directly for over 12 years. Let me just say he does not skip steps, cut corners, or use cheap parts. His craftsmanship is impeccable and his attention to detail is impressive. Although it was an older family car, he treated it with the utmost respect and care as if it was his own child. We ended up renting a car so we could continue our family trip. Throughout the trip, I would get continuous updates from Dan via text. He was very communicative every step of the way. The shop was closed the day we returned from our trip and Dan went out of his way to open the store and accommodate us. When I received the final bill, I was given an itemized receipt with line by line details along with accompanying photos. Everything was done with honesty and integrity so I did not once feel cheated. He even washed the car for me! Post-trip I would get follow up texts from Dan to ensure everything was still running smoothly. A few months later, I had a minor problem (completely separate from what Dan fixed) and texted Dan. He, of course, responded back immediately and talked me through my options.

This is the first time I have ever left a review for an auto shop because I think this is an outstanding small business and Dan is an incredible business owner. I only wish I lived closer so that all of my cars can get the TLD treatment.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I found TLD through online reviews and was admittedly a bit skeptical about there being virtually no negative feedback.  There’s a reason why - Dan earned those marks.  He’s passionate about his craft - Lexus & Toyota in particular, and he’s very fair, thorough & clean.  Without hesitation I whole-heartedly recommend TLD & Dan for your Lexus & Toyota repairs & maintenance.  You will not be disappointed.</Review>

<Text>I was referred to TLD Auto Service.  I am very pleased with the high level of quality, service and workmanship Dan did on my car. Dan explained everything thoroughly,  provided in detail a breakdown of the work I needed on my car, costs, and why.  He did an impeccable job and I will definitely be taking my car back.
If you have a Toyota in need of service,  come to this place. It's hard to find a good mechanic nowadays especially someone who is honest, professional, ethical and takes pride in their work.
I highly recommend Dan.</Text><response>None</response></record>

I’ve been a mechanic for over 40 years and have always been very stringent of who I’d let preform specific repairs on my cars, trucks and equipment besides myself. I’ve determined Dan’s one of the most knowledgeable and technical mechanics I’ve met. His attention to detail and giving the customer value exceeds every other mechanic shop in the Valley and any otherToyota dealers of which 5 different ones I’ve had service at. He cares more about your vehicle then most care about there own vehicle, which creates a huge value to the customer. When compared to the dealers and major repairs he is at a 5%-15 % discount to a Toyota dealer and he provides a superior workmanship. I never, until now had the pleasure of such a dedicated individual as Dan and TLD Auto; with the highest customer service as Dan.

I’ve only known Dan for 7-8 month while doing business with him for my vehicle(s) along with my son who drives down from Fresno to have work done on there 2 Toyota’s. Dan has one of the highest integrity and workmanship that’s incredibly hard to find anywhere in a individual or any business!  I normally give 3-4 star rating  to any other service shop that preforms good to quality work but TLD and Dan easily deserve 5 Stars!

<Text>I recently received my first car. My dad insisted we would take my Toyota to TLD. Upon our arrival Dan greeted us with such hospitality offering us cold water. He then explained what work should be done, informed us more about my car, and ensured that it was left in great hands. Picking up my car the first thing I noticed was how clean my vehicle looked. The engine and compartment was thoroughly detailed and looked new. The car idled quietly and smoothly unlike before. Being a new driver, Dan thorough explained and shared some tips that would increase the longevity of my Toyota. I am pleased to say that Dan is not only my dads mechanic, but mine as well! I look forward to the many year service with TLD.< /Text><resp>None</resp><UserId.>117516629939124563147< /UserId.>< pictures>

Halfway into a 6 hour road trip, my Prius flashed the red triangle of death. It was after 5 and so many locations were closed, so thank GOD that TLD was open and close. Turns out my water pump pooped out. TLD went over and above to make sure we could get back on the road and not have to stay the night in Visalia. We watched Netflix and drank soda while they took care of everything. They even steam cleaned my engine and wiped down my doors and hood! They gave me all kinds of tips to make sure I’m getting the best fuel economy and ensuring my Toyota has a long life. They are GODSENDS, I tell you! There’s a reason why they have only 5 star reviews!!</review>

TLD Auto Service got my 2007 Lexus RX350 running like new again.  I had recently bought my car used with a few issues.  I'm so glad that I came to TLD Auto Service.  They provided diagnostics, preventative maintenance, and expert repairs that are sure to keep my car on the road for years to come.  No need to buy new with their help.  Highly recommended!!<//Review>

I brought my 2014 Camry to Dan's Shop for a 100k mile full maintenance and man this bad boy runs like new all over again. Dan did a fantastic job, good quality maintenance performed by someone that actually cares for his customers, not to mention all parts that he uses are OEM. I will most definitely be bringing my Camry back for every routine maintenance and/or repairs.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I was on a family trip to Sequoia National Park, when my Toyota Sienna broke down. Thank god I found Dan from TLD. He was able to take the car in right away and meticulously examined every single part of the car. He located the problem and immediately placed an order for parts from a quality factory. I appreciated that he had experience working with Toyota and Lexus directly for over 12 years. Let me just say he does not skip steps, cut corners, or use cheap parts. His craftsmanship is impeccable and his attention to detail is impressive. Although it was an older family car, he treated it with the utmost respect and care as if it was his own child. We ended up renting a car so we could continue our family trip. Throughout the trip, I would get continuous updates from Dan via text. He was very communicative every step of the way. The shop was closed the day we returned from our trip and Dan went out of his way to open the store and accommodate us. When I received the final bill, I was given an itemized receipt with line by line details along with accompanying photos. Everything was done with honesty and integrity so I did not once feel cheated. He even washed the car for me! Post-trip I would get follow up texts from Dan to ensure everything was still running smoothly. A few months later, I had a minor problem (completely separate from what Dan fixed) and texted Dan. He, of course, responded back immediately and talked me through my options.

This is the first time I have ever left a review for an auto shop because I think this is an outstanding small business and Dan is an incredible business owner. I only wish I lived closer so that all of my cars can get the TLD treatment.</review>< pictures>

I’m so glad I finally found a mechanic that can work on my car that can be trusted to do a professional job and explain things. Dan went over an beyond any expectations I had.  It needed a lot attended to and he jumped in when others before finding him told me my car wasn’t worth fixing. So many positive reviews I’ve read from others say all I’d be adding here also. So just read for yourself. This is the guy for your Toyota. Thank You Dan!<//review>

The best mechanic I have ever done business with, he knows toyota's like the back of his hand. He is very pleasant and extremely honest, he explains everything he does and sends photos of all his repairs/diagnostic procedures, even gives you a box of all your old parts. His prices reflect with accuracy of repairs and goes above and beyond to try to help his customers out by reducing charges wherever he can. This business in my opinion is worth more than a five star rating.<//Text>

I live in Hanford, 24 miles from TLD Auto. A friend of mine from work suggested IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE DRIVE to have Dan work on my 2007, Toyota Corolla. Long story short,  I now have a new  specialized Toyota mechanic, Dan, from TLD Auto service! Everything about TLD, 100% PROFESSIONAL from customer service to exceptional quality of work! If you don't live in Visalia, like my co-worker said, IT WOULD BE WORTH THE DRIVE!! TLD Auto Service takes a lot of pride in servicing my Toyota! I highly recommend, TLD Auto Service!</Review>

Dan took care of me and my vehicle from the get go and at the time my vehicle was being work on Dan would always keep me posted and updated on the repairs being done...honestly and loyalty is hard to come by these days...Dan’s the man I highly recommend TLD 👍<//review>< pictures>

When I was having trouble starting up my Toyota, I was able to get in contact with Dan Nguyen over at TLD through my father who lives locally, I live all the way in Oregon. Dan was not only willing to help me out over the phone but you could tell he was passionate about helping you fix up your car. Awesome customer service and now my Toyota starts up no problems and he didn't even need to see my car!<//text>

How many 5 star reviews do you need to read before you decide to make an appointment? Once Dan works on your car, you won’t want anyone else to touch it. You can tell he cares deeply about the cars he works on. He takes a holistic approach to proper maintenance, catching bad things before they happen. He will educate you about what he does and why (if you are oblivious to cars like me) and will send you photos of what he’s done. He did a huge amount of work on my highlander hybrid, including replacing the suspension. Honest, easy to talk to, and a super hard worker.<//review>

Great service. Sent photos of the work performed. Good service and had parts in stock that the Toyota dealer did not have (I called to verify). I would recommend.<//Review>

Dan was  by far the best mechanic I have ever been to. He explained everything  in detail was honest and got the best possible price from our warranty company. You can TRUST HIM  unlike many other mechanics. I have already started recommending him to friends and family< /Text>

< review>
Dan was recommended by a friend when I needed some work done on my 07 Tacoma. I didn’t know much about the history of my truck as I bought it used and I questioned the care it received from the previous owner. Dan was able to help me focus on what the priorities were and assess the needs and how to approach it in a cost-effective manner. He didn’t just tell me what he saw, he showed me. Dan knows his stuff when it comes to Toyota/Lexus. I learned so much about the needs of my truck, how it functions and I could help it run better and last longer. Dan is not just a mechanic, he is also a teacher. He doesn’t just care about getting something fixed quickly, he cares about the details and getting it done right, with the right parts and ensuring that you understand what’s being done and why. Also, in the end he saved me money, but the best part is that my truck has never run better and I’ve never been more comfortable or confident in its performance.< /review>

<review>I took my vehicle for a check up and right from the start Dan was attentive to all of my concerns. He patiently went over in detail what he recommended to be done and was not pushy about anything. When I picked up my vehicle he had a detailed description as well as photos of everything that he performed on the vehicle. The vehicle was meticulously cared for and he even steam cleaned the entire engine as a customer courtesy. I was also pleased to know that he holds a Senior Master Technician Credential from Toyota. I drove the vehicle and was highly surprised with the major difference in performance! I will be recommending Dan to all of my family and friends while looking forward to my next visit to TLD Auto Service!</review>< pics>

After meeting and dealing with Dan, I understand why, and completely agree!  Not only is he experienced and knowledgeable,  he shares his knowledge and shows you What and Why the work is needed on your vehicle.   He also has the best Rate.  Thank you Dan!

My wife and I took our 2005 Lexus GX470 to Dan to get the timing belt replaced, and to source an oil leak.  Dan knew right away what to look for, and kept the car for a day so he could make sure he could order all the parts he'd need to complete the job.  He gave us the car back w/ the oil changed and instructions not to drive too much while he waited for the Lexus parts to arrive from the dealer.  Yes that's right, Dan only uses Lexus/Toyota/OEM parts, super critical!  Once the parts came in, Dan let us know to come back and he promptly performed the work and got us back on the road w/o a hitch!  Dan even took care of some poor pricing from the Toyota dealer for us, a nice touch!  This is the only place I'd take our primary vehicle from here on out - thank you Dan and see you in about 2k miles for an oil change, you've got customers for life! :)<//Text>

My experience with Dan at TLD is with scheduled maintenance and he couldn’t have been more thorough and he even took the time to educate me about my Prius and offered simple ways to extend it’s life and improve it’s performance with simple everyday practices and habits and now I care a lot more about taking care of it.  Seriously, his caring is contagious and his integrity is truly inspirational!< /Text>< Resp>

I took my car to TLD Auto Service for a diagnosis. My car has been shaking quite harshly, so it was getting unsafe to drive. Dan was kind enough to fit me into his schedule even though he was backed up.
He kept me posted on all the issues with the car and I further proceeded to have him work on the car. Dan is easy to talk to and is very thorough in his work. He clearly explained each line item on my invoice and gave images for the items. Overall I am glad I came to this shop and would gladly come back in the future.< /text>

Last week I took my 2013 (99,000 mile) Lexus to TLD for service, as there were several issues that needed attention. Dan was extremely thorough, explaining all items in advance. He updated me prior starting any work and completed everything in the projected time. He even followed up the visit with photos of each step and matched it to my invoice — line item by line item. Great price, outstanding customer service and the car runs better than it ever has since purchasing it used with 13,000 miles on it from a Lexus dealer. Thank you, Dan!</text>

I’ve been to numerous mechanics over the years, but I’ve never encountered a mechanic like Dan. Dan isn't just an expert mechanic, he’s passionate about what he does and cares deeply about his customers. I’m not exaggerating when I say he treats your vehicle like his own and treats you like a lifelong friend.

Aside from my routine oil change, he cleaned the vehicle exterior and my engine bay (which was mired in dust, causing issues with temperature control), caught some potential problems (that I was oblivious to) and spared me from what would have inevitability been a serious and costly failure in the near future.  For my business, I depend on my vehicle working, to keep me working. Dan’s quality service gives me confidence that I my vehicle and I will continue to get the job done. And thanks to Dan’s wealth of knowledge, I’ve come away with a greater understanding and appreciation of my vehicle.

It’s difficult to adequately express how nice it feels to have found a mechanic who I can totally trust to have my best interest at heart. Dan has raised the bar so high, I fear that I’ll be disappointed if I ever have to take my Toyota Tacoma to any other mechanic. Thank you Dan!!< /Text>

Dan was extremely knowledgeable and nice.  I had taken my Lexus LS 430 to 2 different Lexus dealerships and they couldn’t solve the problem and cost me a ton of money.  Being new I googled Lexus and stumbled across TLD.  Dan had my Lexus back in 3 days, problem solved and a fraction of what Lexus had charged me.  I would highly recommend Dan and his team.<//Text>

I was recommended to go to Dan by my sales person who sold me my Lexus. I was really happy he did so because not only did it save me a whole 1 hour trip to the nearest Lexus dealership I would have missed out on his great customer service! Immediately you can tell how passionate Dan is with his work! He is very educated and knows what he’s doing! I definitely recommend TLD Auto Service to all these who have a Lexus or Toyota! He provides picture text messages of before and after whatever he fixes. He really goes above and beyond and explains to you what needs to be done now and what can wait for the future! He cares a lot about his costumers, you could never find what Dan does at any other dealership. He’s the real definition of great costumer service!</Text>

I always thought I maintained my 2013 Prius until I went to Dan at TLD. Dan demonstrated that while I was going to my dealer, I was not necessarily getting what I was supposed to from the mechanic. With both before and after pictures, he showed me what my car was really supposed to look like once a proper procedure was completed. My car has more power and runs smoother than ever before. I am a total believer in this man. If that isn’t enough, his prices are far below what I have paid previously. He is more than fair and I could not be happier.<//review>

<text>Dan is truly one of a kind. I’m not exaggerating. He treats my car like it’s his own personal baby. He took care to analyze the problems and listed them one by one by text with photos. He’s super kind and even dropped the car off at my house once I got home late in the evening because I was driving back from the Bay Area. He was going to Uber back but I insisted on driving him back to the shop. He talked to me about my car and the plan to get it running perfectly again now that I will be using the higher quality fuel as he suggested. He threw a few things in to make it more affordable since it was such a high cost. That’s just so nice. He doesn’t have to do that. He’s amazing. I’m just so thrilled and grateful that I have access to this talented and skilled honest human being of exemplary character. Seriously. Thankful.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Dan is a genius with a Toyota. After 262,000 miles dan  has it running like it was off the showroom floor. He will sit with you and explain what he is going to do to your vehicle in simple terms so you understand without talking down to you, and th n when he is finished he’ll show pictures of what it looked like before and after. If you have a Toyota, Dan is the man.  If you just bought a Toyota take it to him and let him tell you what you should do to keep it in great shape that the dealership won’t. It is worth it, if I had only known that when I bought it. Worth every penny. Thanks so much Dan.< /Review>

Dan knows Toyota! I don't have a Lexus but I’m sure he knows them just as well. Ask him anything about your car and he knows the history of how and why Toyota made something in a specific manner. He will keep you updated on every minute detail of your maintenance and repairs. A good mechanic is hard to find, and an honest one is a treasure.
Dan is the real deal!<//review>

We own a 1999 Lexus RX300 that was unable to pass smog and more than likely was on its way to the salvage yard, but we gave Dan one last crack at it.  After Dan was able to fix it, and the Smog Check Co told me that it passed with better numbers than a new car would!!!

Dan is the Best and now my 2008 Toyota Highlander has had the royal treatment, it runs like new!!!!

If you own a Toyota or Lexus, Don't take it Anywhere Else!!!<//Review>

I found Dan to be  honest and informative, with incredible work ethic.  He is highly skilled, experienced and knowledgable about any car issue imaginable.  He serviced my vehicle with impeccable care and cleanliness.  He takes pride in a job well done and ensures that the work done on your car is top quality.  Without hesitation, even though commuting from Bakersfield, I will return to Dan for any mechanical maintenance or services needed.<//Review>

I drove all the way from Sacramento to have my Avalon serviced by Dan after hearing about his excellent service record

I was not disappointed!!

He exceeded my expectations.  The Roseville Toyota dealer quoted $1800 to perform a task that Dan performed for $155!!!

Not only did he fix that problem but he also (without asking) got the pesky “check tire pressure light” to go off.

I highly recommend TLD!!< /review>

If you got Toyota/Lexus just go to TLD for better service.</review>< pictures>

Very professional. He's really experienced and is very knowledgeable. I know I can trust leaving my car with him, with many problems, and know I will get it back in great condition with the problems fixed and the issues addressed properly. I have a Toyota Prius and I highly suggest that if you have a Toyota, no in Visalia can give you better business than TLD. Thank you Dan!< /Review>

<Text>I have never found a mechanic quite like Dan. He takes pride in his work and he won't do a subpar job on your vehicle. His work is impeccable and you can trust that the work he says your car needs is what  gets done. He's not the cheapest mechanic in town, but if you're looking for a bargain versus quality work, you get what you pay for. I'm not taking my 4 runner anywhere else but to TLD Auto service.</Text>< pictures>

I took my Lexus to Dan at TLD Auto Service to find out why the “check engine” light was coming on. Not only did he find and fix the problem, within 30 minutes, but he went above and beyond that...to check other parts on the vehicle and to give me tips about when to have certain parts checked or changed. He also gave me some vital information about my battery size. I was very impressed with his efficiency, knowledge and character. I would definitely recommend Dan to my family and friends or any Toyota/Lexus owner.< /review>

Best honest mechanic ever! Thanks Dan for taking care of my Camry and Sienna van they run so much better. He uses OEM parts only so your not getting ripped off with aftermarket parts. And he’s really affordable and worth every dollar spent. My cars feel like they have more power too. I highly recommend this mechanic to anyone who owns a Toyota or Lexus can’t go wrong.</Review>

My husband and I took our daughter’s Toyota Rav to Dan for possible transmission problems. He is a consummate professional with a terrific work ethic. His pricing is very reasonable, and in the long run, I am sure he saved us a lot of money. We would not hesitate to recommend his services.< /Review>

Dan came recommended by others and really did a great job. He talked through all the work so that there would be no surprises. He fixed only the parts that needed fixing, and he cleaned up my engine as well free of charge!
Dan provides a great and well-thought-out service for Toyota owners.</Review>

<Text>The best auto repair in town! Dan is very knowledgable and transparent when working on your car. I had called to explain what happened to my car and he already knew what was wrong. He thoroughly explains why something needs to be replaced, with factory parts, along with the importance of proper maintenance.  I was unbelievably impressed with his attention to detail and genuinely kind nature, which I have not received any where else.  It was such a relief to drive away confident knowing that he took great care of my car. I will continue to go see Dan for any repairs and regular service check-ups!</Text><Time>1562720765078<//Time>< GmapID>

He not only fixes your car the right way, he'll also help you with advice so you can keep your car running at it's best.

From this experience forward, I would ONLY  recommend Dan! Over the past year I have spent several thousand dollars on car repairs with the issue not being fixed, or -unknown to me- only temporarily fixed and other issues created. My car had been to the shop every several months. The morning I took my car to Dan, he met me at my car and while we were talking he asked me to open my hood...he smelled something. My alternator was on fire! He quickly disconnected my battery before any other damage occurred.  I left the car and quickly learned how passionate Dan is about providing excellent service. He constantly updated me and sent pictures. His integrity is second to none. That is not something I have seen in many, many years! He went well above and beyond to provide excellent service. When I picked up the car EVERYTHING  was better than when I took it in. He even steam cleaned the engine, did an exterior wash and cleaned all of my floor mats. He repaired what the others had done incorrectly and fixed things they couldn't. I feel blessed to have found him when I did.<//text>

I am a college student and I own a 2000 Lexus RX 300. I was referred to TLD Auto Repair with Dan and I appreciate his flexibility with my schedule and his affordable pricing. I like that he works on reliable cars like Toyota and Lexus and uses genuine and authentic parts. He is always sending pictures which was super great to me because it shows how much of an honest person he is. He was always transparent. I will definitely use him again.</Review>

Dan is one of the best ever! First time taking my Lexus for maintenance and very glad I found him! He was so educated and very informing about what is best for your car and how you can save money! Will go over what needs replacing and fixing and will not preform any service without your permission. Dan will also text you with updates and send before and after photos. He is so dedicated and passionate about his work that you know after meeting him you will get quality work and guarantees your car will drive better afterwards. Will recommend him to anyone that has a Lexus/Toyota in the area that needs service and a trusted mechanic.<//Review>

We encountered Dan as a result of looking at his excellent reviews. Dan is extremely detailed in his work and will explain what is needed and offers you the option of making decisions. He is reliable and dependable and have been back several time due to his great customer service! Will continue to come back and continue to refer friends and family!< /Review>

< Review>
I recently took my 2004 Toyota Tundra to TLD (Toyota, Lexus, Diagnostic - Hybrid) in Visalia for service by owner Dan T. Nguyen, Master Certified Technician. I must say I have never been treated as well as Dan treated me during my visit. He was friendly, attentive, and very informed on all things Toyota. From the way he presented himself to how his equipment and shop is maintained, says volumes about what a real professional he is. When I picked up my truck it was running at idle, very quietly and smooth. The engine compartment was freshly power washed, (at no cost to me) and looked amazing. As assured by Dan prior to service, my truck now responds and performs like new since I took it to TLD. As a longtime owner of many Toyotas, I can honestly say Dan is truly one of the best. Thanks TLD!<//Review>

<text>Dan is a highly professional individual who enjoys his work tremendously. I fee lucky to have met and have him take care of my Lexus. Since the service the car drives like a brand new car even with 125,000 miles on it already. I had been to various dealerships in my lifetime and I will never switch services with any body else. I would say he is honest, definitely competent and a very true and sincere friend. May his business thrive and continue to grow.</text>< Time>

I took my girlfriends corolla as well as her grandma and mother’s Lexus’s to Dan for tune ups and oil changes. He went above and beyond to give the best service possible and it was shown by a noticeable difference in the vehicles serviced. He takes pictures of all work and proves the work is done by sending before and after pictures by text. Dan’s work is better than the dealer for your Lexus or Toyota.<//review>

Dan is fantastic. He is the best mechanic I’ve ever met. When he works on your vehicle he treats it as if it was his own. He documents all work performed and takes time to explain via pictures what he’s doing and why. My Toyota drives better than ever. You owe it to yourself to go to Dan if you own a Toyota or Lexus.</review>

<Text>There's a reason Dan hasn't received a single review lower than 5 stars which is amazing in itself--Dan gives amazing service every time!  The extra touches he provides such as car and engine washes, pickups and drop offs, aren't extra touches to him but just part of the experience. Who else does this??? No one. I've been to him 4 or 5 times and hesitated writing a review because he's one guy and if everyone takes their car to him, naturally his time and attention to my vehicle will decrease right?? Well, the 5 star reviews and new customers keep coming in but the service remains superb and like no one else!! He has saved me so much time and money not just on my car, but being able to continue to work without down time and avoiding car-tastrophies.</Text>< Pics>

Dan is amazing!  His attention to detail and passion for Toyota & Lexus care is exceptional.   TLD Auto Service prides itself on 5-Star customer service and he delivers.   Prices are very competitive and much lower than taking your vehicle to the dealership.   So, if you’re looking for great service at a practical cost, take your vehicle to Dan at TLD in Visalia!

I am so glad that I found Dan at TLD auto service. I got my highlander serviced here for 30k miles maintenance, he did a very outstanding work on it. My car runs so much better than before! He explained to me what was replaced and how to keep the car running smoothly. I also really like how he informed me what’s been done to the car so I know exactly what was replaced. Not only that he is a master technician, he is a very kind and humble as a person too which is always a plus! I definitely recommend TLD auto service for all your Toyota/Lexus needs.<//Text>

Great dude for being a mechanic his pretty damn clean, plus his affordable, knowledgeable,  and honest. I own a Toyota Corolla and a Tacoma glad I met Dan through a ride I gave him through Lyft I really do recommend  him for your Toyota vehicles and I wont be taking my cars else where, he uses nothing but Toyota parts. While others were guessing he knew right away what the problem was I was having on my Tacoma. So yea check him out his very explanatory about what work he does to your vehicles very trust worthy.<//text>

{'time': 1552801611855, 'text': 'Thank you Jose for your business and your time to leave a great review! Your Camry is very new with only 35,000 miles and brake rotors vibrations are usually caused by over torqued wheel lug nuts during tires rotation. I felt bad that it happened to your vehicle and it’s an annoying problem that has to be fixed ASAP for your safety. Front rotors measured at .004 of an inch run out and the rear had .003 of an inch warpage. The max specifications for any brake rotors are .001, or lower to give you the maximum braking force, performance and a smooth driving experience on the new vehicle’s braking system. Factory service has always delivered best result for your Toyota to the fullest! And thank you Jose for the recommendations!'}</Response>

I was referred to Dan by a co-worker, I took my Toyota Camry to him so he can tell me why it shakes when I brake , and after a hour or so he had found the problem. He told me that it was my rotors. So he recently resurfaced them for me and the car runs great now. Dan has real reasonable prices and great customer service . Dan even recommended me what kind of tires to buy. Dan is  full of knowledge and takes a lot of pride in the work he does. He is a great mechanic but a even  better person. I'm definitely coming back to his shop to get service on my Toyota.< /Text>

I needed a last minute oil change, so I contacted Dan and he was able to service my car the next day. When I picked up my car, it looked, smelled, and drove like a brand new car! He is VERY knowledgeable and honest. This is the best auto service and customer service you will ever experience. I highly recommend everyone to bring their Toyota/Lexus to TLD Auto Service.<//Review>

< Review>
I own a 2001 Toyota Camry it has over 190,000 miles on it.  I was referred to Dan's shop by several individuals.  This is the first time that I have been satisfied with work that was done on my car.  The car is running smoother and better than it has in years.  Dan is very knowledgeable on Toyota's and explained every service that needed to be done.  Dan goes above and beyond when servicing your vehicle.  He takes a personal interest in your vehicle like it is his.   Dan will even do a follow up with you to make sure that you are satisfied with your service and that your vehicle is up to your standards.  I would highly recommend any Toyota owner to take their car to Dan.<//Review>

I have always been skeptical with what I read from on line reviews specially when the contents are mostly positive. However, after my husband and I witnessed sincere honesty and compassion from Dan at TLD Auto Service in Visalia, I feel compelled to share the experience we have had with him this week and to somehow validate the truth in the 46 Google reviews we had read.
My husband and I recently had an unfortunate incident with our Lexus 2010 HS 250h while we were out of town driving.  It was a horrifying experience but we are very grateful to GOD we came out of it safe.
Because the car was not drivable and there is no Lexus Dealership in the area my husband Google searched for a reputable auto repair shop. He came across TLD Auto Service that specialize in Toyota and Lexus cars and was convinced by the 5 star reviews that he read.
After doing his diagnostics, Dan took his time to explain in detail while at the same time showing my husband & I,  my sister and brother in law, what had caused the car to break down. I was totally terrified of what could have happened not just to my husband and I but maybe to others as well.  However, his relaxed demeanor, his impressive knowledge and expertise were very comforting.
Unfortunately, he advised us that repair related to recall could only be done through Lexus dealership. He documented his findings, took pictures and for the third time our car was towed to Lexus Bakersfield dealership, which is closer to home. The transfer made me very anxious but he reassured us that in that dealership – “they are good people”.
To us who know nothing about cars, someone honest who cares about doing the right thing is what we always hope and pray for. Dan is truly a blessing!</Text>

<Review>Took my 2009 Scion which needed a complete service over to TLD Auto Repair, and Dan performed a thorough inspection and recommended what work needed to be done and the parts that needed to be replaced. He did a really great job and my car is running like new. The replacement parts Dan used were Toyota genuine parts also. I highly recommend TLD Auto Repair for your next service cause Dan's expertise and exceptional service was beyond my expectations. Thanks again!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The first ownership never did any services to the Scion and even the engine oils wasn’t replaced on time either. Now in your possession, you are very wise to do all of the proper services on it to gain back the fuel economy, its liability and lastly, the new performance that was lost years ago. Your Scion is now in top shape and also in good hands, many thanks to your dedication! Thanks again for your business...!'}</Response>

Thanks Dan for working on our Sienna van! We used this van for so many trips it had over 200,000 on it. Dan went through it and flushed out everything and did an amazing job! Changed water pump, belts , coolants, spark plugs, gaskets too! He really put's in perfection when it comes to his work. He uses only the best Toyota OEM parts, not aftermarket stuff. He's very honest and can be very trusted.</Review>

I was very happy and satisfied with the attention to detail that Dan the owner and Mechanic gave to me and my 2006 Toyota Tundra. I drive this truck every day and everywhere for my Appliance Repair Business and it is my best tool that I have. I will always take my truck there to have serviced and repaired. Dan is very knowledgeable, clean and easy to work with. Thank you once again for your time today!!!!! Adam T. Stevens

Glad I found Dan! I was so impressed with his expertise and professionalism after servicing our ‘07 Sequoia, I brought my ‘01 Sequoia in for an oil change and a last minute once over before a road trip. First, he stayed late because he wanted to make sure it was ok to go, then when he found the radiator had a small crack and was slowly leaking, he sent me photos and was able to order the new radiator and thermostat and completed the repair the next day in time for our trip! Not only that, he somehow found the time to recharge our weak a/c, clean the very dirty throttle body, add fuel system cleaner, lubricate u-joints and a number of items that had been neglected over the years, and test and replace the battery that was at end of life. The fluid I had noticed a few days before wasn’t just from the a/c condensation - very thankful Dan cared enough to extend his day and be so thorough with his inspection and repairs. His keen attention to detail and genuine care for his customer prevented a disaster and we were able to enjoy our trip in a vehicle that felt new again.< /Review>

I work for a government agency and had been looking for a Toyota repair shop that would be able to repair our hybrid vehicles. A friend gave me a business card to TLD Auto Service. I had the opportunity to visit his shop, introduce myself and established an account to repair our fleet. Only a certified mechanic should be removing & installing these particular hybrid batteries.  He is highly trained, skilled and professional.  I was very impressed with his attention to detail with photos sent with me, feeling that I was looking over his shoulder.  As a mechanic, I am aware of the detail in his work as well as his hourly rate, that is significantly lower than the dealer. He installs genuine OEM parts in all the vehicles.
We hope to be dealing with him for years to come.</Text>< time>

Dan is an experienced tech with a genuine soul, and was such an blessing for us! We found him after previous bad experiences with other shops and mechanics. He was able to determine our problem right away, and even though he was busy with other vehicles, he was sure to get us up and running the same day. He is very affordable, knowledgeable and an absolute asset to any Toyota or Lexus owner!<//review>

Toyota and Lexus are great vehicles to own because #1 - they hold their resale value and #2 - they do last a long time if it was properly serviced from the start. Anytime a vehicle is properly serviced, then the word REPAIR will NOT be around as much as not maintained. A well serviced vehicle always and always save you money in the long run and higher fuel economy is the best part overall because it saves you even more money on a weekly basis. Yes, services cost money, but REPAIRS cost 4-5 times more so services are by far a cheaper approach. Thanks again Rebecca for your time to come in and enjoy your Toyota's new performance!"}< /response><Text>If you have a Toyota or Lexus I highly reccomend TLD for service. Dan is very knowledgeable and honest. He provided me with text before and after pictures and comments for each issue he fixed. Also provided me with a list of what I should fix now and what ca. Wait for later. When I picked my car up he took time to answer all of my questions and pointed out what he did. Prices are more than fair and he does not skimp on parts. Toyota original.

As previous employee of the 5 star Ritz Carlton hotel SF im familiar with high standards.
I cannot express my appreciation to the detail to every single repair and going beyond my expectation of satisfaction.
Not only was I approached with friendly gestures my Toyota Yaris no longer make shrinking noises when I start my engine...
It runs smoother.
My engine as well as my car was washed and cleaned. I'm sold on TLD !

I gave TLD a shot at the dreaded engine check indicator WHY is that on??? I'm so impressed with the wholesome rare experience of meeting a mechanic with a obvious passion for Toyota and his job . That I'm putting TLD on top of list for further maintenance/repair when needed. I speak from 24 years of OTR trucking . Believe me a good honest mechanic is priceless...!!!<//text>

Unparalleled service! I have never been so informed by any mechanic. He has a love for Toyota’s and a passion for the mechanics and maintenance of your vehicle.

I went in to see Dan about a alternator problem on a Lexus. He correctly diagnosed the problem and explained exactly what needed to be done. He even went above and beyond and put in oil and refrigerant in my noisy AC and now it is quiet and puts out super cold air. Dan is incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and very affordable. If you have a Toyota or Lexus that needs to be serviced I would highly recommend you go see Dan, you will be glad did.</Review>

Dan goes above and beyond with his service. I have never experienced a mechanic that understands the impact he can have with his clients by just communicating with them. His flexibility in scheduling and over the top service is new to me and so much appreciated. I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking full disclosure, honesty and hard work.< /Text>

A lot of Toyota and Lexus vehicles do not get the right services performed to it over the years is simply because not all shops have the Factory recommended service for your vehicles. A poor serviced Lexus does not deliver the same peak performance as per designed as a Lexus that is well service for your ownership's experience. Thanks again Trish for your time and the recommendations...!"}< /response>

Have you ever considered making a mechanic a part of your family? I have been dealing with Dan the past several weeks and have been treated with great respect and appreciation. I brought my friends in for Dan to fix their 2002 Toyota pick up, and he was gracious and kind and generous in his estimate to repair what was wrong.  He performed tasks above and beyond what he quoted and did not even charge for them. He even repaired something a previous mechanic did incorrectly and, again, did not charge for it. My friends were thrilled with his work, his work ethic, and his very reasonable pricing. I will be bringing my Lexis to him
next week and I know I can look forward to the same  excellent service. This is unlike any auto repair shop I have ever had dealings with and I am incredibly surprised and pleased.  Dan  is raising the bar on integrity in a field of business that has traditionally had a lousy reputation. You would be lame not to give him a chance to work on your Toyota or your Lexus.

11/29/18 My second trip to Dan's place was  a great experience. I left my car in his capable hands, and while working on it, he texted me photos of a few items he had discovered that we did not talk about.  These were things done by other mechanics and they were done wrong. I asked him to correct them and he moved on to showing me photos of before and after (before he was finished and I picked up my Lexus). Dan is refreshingly honest and genuinely cares about his clientele. I know I have a mechanic for life. With Dan as my mechanic, my car will probably outlast me!</Review>

Every business is completely different and has their own protocol to run their business. The hardest part in this business is that a Toyota, or Lexus that was not properly diagnosed from the start to begin with then the existing problem will not be repaired correctly from the start as well. You will never lose money when doing the services, you'd only lose when a component prematurely failed from poor service. Now, you have to spend more money to repair it, thus not saving you any money! Thanks again for everything!"}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//Gmap_id></record>

Dan helped me out today and provided me with a Lexus key fob battery. I’m from Fresno, happened to be in Visalia when the battery ran low. I’m so grateful for Dan and his honest business practice! I definitely will come to him for my repairs instead of Fresno Lexus. ❤️👍🏼❤️<//text>

So glad we found Dan! He’s an honest, reliable and highly skilled mechanic. Diagnosed my car quickly and the car was fixed faster then expected! If you own a Toyota or Lexus, make sure to see Dan before going to a dealership or elsewhere! He uses OEM parts and his services are fairly priced. I am extremely confident that my car was diagnosed and repaired properly. I can’t thank you enough Dan!<//Text>

<Text>My mother in law was on her way down from Fresno and her check engine light went on... She called me in a panic and I told her pull over and let me make a call. I googled Lexus repair in Visalia and TLD popped up... I called and Dan said send her right over... I explained that she was heading down to Orange county. He took excellent care of her! He fixed and showed her all the work that needed to be done. I have been in the car business for over 20+ years myself and the level of customer service that we received was over the top. He took before and after pics of issues with her car. He was are you ready.... HONEST and FAIR!! For that right there I would give him 10 stars!!! Thank you for helping my mother in law make it down to the OC... She was coming to watch my kids for a week so with out her being there we would be in a HUGE bind! Thank you again!!!!<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>We recently took our Lexus with 160+ thousand mileages for service to Dan at TLD.  As promised, the car is running fast and smooth again like new. We are very satisfied - - Not only that the price is reasonable and the service is excellent but most importantly we have the piece of mind that we are not being ripped off. There is no price tag for that!
Highly recommended!!!< /Review><rate>5</rate>< pictures>

Dan at TLD Auto Service does it again! I like to refer to him as the Toyota Doctor! This is my second visit to TLD, with this visit focusing on maintenance. Not only did Dan complete all the tasks we discussed, he also sent pictures along the way of everything and made suggestions to further enhance my trucks performance...
Dan, simply put, is the BEST at what he does. As if his service wasn't enough, his fees and pricing are more than amazing! I truly couldn't appreciate Dan more and all that he has done for me to keep my truck in tip top shape!! I will certainly continue to take my truck there...the only problem is that my family isn't able to take all our vehicles there (he specializes in Toyota/Lexus). Maybe one day I can talk him into work on our Chevy too ;)</text>

Finally... somebody that knows how to care for my Sequoia, and I can't wait to get my 4Runner into Dan and set him loose on it.  Dan is very refreshing and extremely passionate about Toyota and Lexus.  In the past, I've taken my vehicles to the Dealer or other reputable mechanics.  I'd spend gawd-awful $$ for maintenance and repairs with little change in how they performed.   I can honestly say that when I drove my Sequoia home from Dan's shop, I thought I was driving a completely different vehicle.  Wow... I was seriously impressed!  Dan texted me pics of every maintenance deficiency he found while thoroughly inspecting my Sequoia and took care of the issues at a reasonable cost, and he ONLY uses Toyota OEM parts.  Dan knows his stuff and will be the only mechanic working on my Toyota's in the future.<//review>

I had recently purchased a new 2019 4runner. It was in two accidents days apart. Dan was kind enough to look over my car after it was done at the body shop. He adjust a few things to his standards and also found a few things I didn't notice that need to be fixed. He gave me so much information on how to properly use and maintain my vehicle. I have never had a mechanic give explanations of why and how things work on a vehicle the way he does. With all the information Dan gave me this car might out last me! Once you meet Dan and have him work on your car you won't want to go anywhere else.< /Text>

Unparalleled craftsmanship, complete focus on customer experience and amazing savings!

I was happy to find a shop in Visalia that specializes in servicing Lexus, and looked forward to avoiding the hassle of a day trip to Fresno to get quality work done on my Lexus. What I experienced was so much more than convenience. Dan took time to understand what I wanted to have done and went to great lengths to provide options that would fit my budget. His attention to detail and expert knowledge lead me to chose to have a considerable amount of work done. I’m really glad I made the investment and feel confident my Lexus is in optimum condition to last many, many more miles! My car runs and looks amazingly like new too- thanks to Dan’s fine work! Best of all, the investment I made was significantly less than I would’ve paid at the dealer!

Dan made a point to provide great detail (and photos) of all the work he did. That was quite an education, and I’m really glad I took Dan’s advice to proceed with some of the maintenance I had been putting off.

My Lexus and I have found a new friend in Dan and TLD Auto Service. I am happy to offer my testimony of complete satisfaction and my wholehearted recommendation.</Text>

A Lexus will only drive like a Lexus and perform like one if and only if it was properly serviced from the beginning.

Great thorough & extremely fair priced service, by TLD Auto Service. I met with Dan the owner prior to dropping of our 2004 Avalon for a routine upper & lower radiator hose, thermostat replacement & radiator flush. It was easy to see Dan is an extremely honest business man and a fine master technician. During the service he provided text photos clearly showing other maintenance issues recommended. Including side by side photo comparison of the current part to a new OEM replacement part. One service visit will convince you, Dan is the one you want servicing your Toyota!< /text>

If you are searching for a Toyota/Lexus Senior Master Technician who is highly skilled, honest, more than fair in his pricing, committed to excellence, and ethical, look no further than TLD Auto Service.  For future customers who are not in the area, allow me to reassure you, it is worth the drive and travel time from anywhere to bring your vehicle to Dan's TLD Auto Service.< /Text>

I have known Dan for several years now and he has serviced all of our cars with great care and knowledge and expertise always.  Most importantly, Dan is a very honest and trustworthy mechanic and person that takes the time to honestly communicate with you and explain your options to service your car.  Once you go to Dan you will never take your car to another automotive shop.  Dan defines the meaning of a professional and expert mechanic with great and open and honest communication skills.<//Review>

He offered me a beverage and also offered to pay for a ride back home while i wait.Afterwards gave me advice  on how to maintain  it untill the next service. Great Pricing

<review>TLD Auto Service takes pride in there work and do it the right way.  While visiting from San Diego, I had an alternator problem on a Friday afternoon.  I needed to drive back in San Diego on Sunday.  Emailed LTD and they got right back to me and made arrangements to take care of my alternator the next morning, Saturday.  Dan, at TLD, went above and beyond by not only expertly fixing the alternator, but by also thoroughly inspecting and fixing several other issues.  Additionally, Dan cleaned the throttle body, steam cleaned the engine, and washed the car at no additional charge.   I wish he were located in San Diego.  I highly recommend TLD for your Toyota Lexus repairs and service.</review>< pics>

It is very unfortunate that you had to spend some money for the repairs, but the fortunate thing is that it failed near your son's house, being located in the valley where the repair labor is much lower.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  I would like to Thanks Dan for providing best customer service.  I brought my car in for a strange noise.  Dan inspected my car and said nothing was wrong with it except for a loose nuts on the heat shield of the catalytic converter.  He tightened up all the nuts and inspected my entire vehicle.  Upon inspection, Dan discovered there was a leak surrounding the oil pan and my rear brake was worn out.  I made an appointment with Dan to have the oil pan gasket and brakes replaced.  Dan replaced all the parts with genuine OEM parts.  I am very happy with the service and will bring all my cars here to service from now on.
Dan, a very honest and highly skill Certified Master Technician.  He takes time to explain what is wrong with your car and ONLY recommend necessary services.  By the way, I have never encountered any repair shops that are so clean and organized.</text>

I met Dan owner of TLD a few years ago in San Jose Ca to work on my IS 350 , after years of getting ripped off by the dealerships. Dan not only fixed the new things i needed maintenance on he fixed things the dealership did wrong !! Honest, caring and very knowledgeable, i won't let anyone else touch my car, he really is Dan The Man !! I just drove 200 miles for him to replace my waterpump and a few other things and my car has never run better !!! If you care about your Toyota/Lexus there is no one better. He is a Master Lexus Technician  and knows them inside and out .. Won't push parts on you that don't need fixing , sends pictures of new/ old parts you never have to wonder if thing's were really done and great to know they were done right. He is the best !!! Can't say enough !!<//Review>

I recently took my vehicle to get a diagnosis with Dan, and let me tell you he was able to find the issue pretty quickly and is in the process of repairing it. Not only are his prices affordable but his work ethic is very firm, honest and detailed. I look forward to continue doing business with Dan at TLD auto service.<//Text>

<Time>1572561116531<//Time><rating>5</rating><name>Jae M</name><Response>None</Response><Text>Let me Start by Saying DAN IS THE BEST!!!!!
3 Years Ago,  the engine seized on my 1999 Lexus RX300,   I purchased a used Japanese Engine with the 50K or less miles.  I paid a DIFFERENT MECHANIC(NOT DAN) to install the engine.

For 3 years, that mechanic attempted to get the Check Engine Light to stay off longer than 50 Miles.  He kept changing part after part in the the vehicle only to get NEW ERROR CODES.  This mechanic was paid close to $3K (I bought the engine for $1K and had it sent to the mechanics shop) and here comes October 2109 and a SMOG is due and still the Check Engine Light.

Many times I though to just salvage the car, and cut my losses.  The RX300 is in great shape and I take good care of it.  I took it to 2 Other Mechanics and for $500 EACH ($1K), I was told they COULD NOT FIX the Issue.

I found DAN with an internet search and decided to give it one Last Try!  When I took the RX300 into Dan, I told him I really didn't have anymore money to spend on the vehicle UNLESS he could get it to the point of Passing the Smog.  Dan told me, that he would NOT CHARGE ME UNLESS HE COULD GET IT TO PASS SMOG!!!!!    WHAT!!!!!   WHAT!!!!

AN HONEST MECHANIC!!!!

Dan had the vehicle for 2 weeks, and did Numerous Corrections to the Initial Replacement of the Japanese 50K Engine.  Wrong Gaskets, Old Worn Gaskets, Broken Bolts, Stripped Bolts, Non-OEM Parts, and Incorrect Parts were ALL used by the First Mechanic.

Dan updated me almost daily with Text, Calls, and Photos of what was wrong and how he corrected it.  At the end of the 2 weeks, Dan had the vehicle carbon output equal to a Brand New Car.

The Car Passed Smog with Flying Colors!!!

Dan is the Best and will be the ONLY Mechanic to touch my Lexus and 3 Toyotas!!!

Thanks, Dan!!!<//Text></record>

<text>I must say Dan is one heck of a mechanic. He knows his stuff and it shows in his work. I went to him with my is300 to get the clutch replaced. Along the way we bumped into some problems with the car, but he sure did help clear all that up. Sends pictures of the damaged parts and sends a follow up with the new parts installed. Really helps you have piece of mind when you get work done by him. I can’t say the same about dealers since they don’t go the extra mile like Dan himself. My car feels better than ever.

Dan did not disappoint, he went above and beyond in his service and made sure all repairs were done correctly.

I would highly recommend Dan to anyone who owns a Toyota or Lexus. I keep up with the matinence on my 2012 Lexus is250. Dan has really helped me get my Lexus to drive and perform like new. He is the most honest mechanic you will ever meet.  He will take pictures of you vehicle and what he is working on. His prices are reasonable and he takes great pride in his work. I truly am thankful to have such great service here at TLD Auto. His service truly is outstanding and keeps me doing my business here locally in Visalia. I have referred Dan to several of my friends and parents. They too are very please with the amazing service.  Thank you Dan!</Review>

This is my 2nd review of Dan, we took our 2012 Prius to him for a vehicle inspection after my wife and I bought our first car.

We ended up getting in a car crash and buying a newer plug in with less miles, the first thing we did is take it to Dan for another inspection and to establish a maintenance schedule. He recommended we do an oil change and an EFI fuel intake carbonize service which we did. He always sends us before and after pictures to show what the filters looked like when replaced, which is quite nice as it shows a level of honesty you don't normally see.

We trust Dan in full and look forward to the many years driving our little car.< /text>

To all LEXUS and Toyota owners I took our LEXUS to TLD in Visalia, California for the first time and what a difference. If you live in Bakersfield, Wasco, McFarland, DELANO and the surroundings are please take my advice and take your vehicles to TLD and see and talk to owner Dan Nguyen. Mr Nguyen is very honest and knowledgeable on Lexus, and Toyota vehicle’s. Take Mr. Nguyen you’re vehicle’s he will do the correct and excellent work on your vehicle’s. As he did on our Lexus 2017, Rc350.

I stumbled upon Dan's TLD Auto Service by chance, and boy am I happy I did.  I took my 2014 FJ Cruiser there for a transmission service as a kind of test.  He passed with flying colors!  I had become disenchanted with the local dealership and was looking for a good indy shop to trust my truck to.  Dan is professional, knowledgeable, and very thorough.  He gave me future recommendations and did not try to upsell me.  His prices are lower than the dealership and very fair.  He uses Toyota fluids, oil, and filters so you know you are getting the best for your vehicle.
I feel confident recommending Dan 100% to everyone-especially those who really care about their car.<//text>

<Review>Received excellent service and care on my Toyota from Dan.  He uses only OEM parts, which is very important if you want to keep your Toyota/Lexus running like it did originally from the factory.  His attention to detail and customer service are truly unmatched in this day and age.<//Review>< name>

<review>I took my Lexus IS 250 into TLD Auto Service and was very please with the customer service, expertise, integrity and knowledge that Dan has. Dan offered a breakdown of the cost of the car maintenance prior to servicing the car so that I may have an estimate. There were no surprises. He is a certified technician that really cares about the quality of his work and his customers.  It is also a plus to have the shop here locally. Thanks again Dan!< /review>< pics>

I was referred to Dan by a  friend who always mentioned how great, knowledgeable and honest he was. I have a 2014 Lexus that I’ve serviced at Fresno Lexus since purchasing. My car was sounding off and I decided to come to Dan and have him take a look at my concerns. Dan is very knowledgeable and explained what he would do. I Picked up my car from Dan today and it sounded so much different and better like new like when I drove it off the lot the first time. It didn’t sound or drive this way after my last Fresno Lexus visit for service. My car was returned washed and vaccum. And can I mention he even cleaned under the hood. I can’t beleive Fresno Lexus doesn’t do that! It was filthy. Dan is a full service shop without that high ticket price and I will return here and recommend him to any Toyota and Lexus owners.</text>

I actually found Dan online looking for another shop and I am sure glad I went with Dan instead! If I could give Dan more stars I would! This is the first time going to TLD and I will certainly be back. Dan took excellent care of our 4runner. I have never owned a new vehicle but after the 170k service that Dan provide the 4runner certainly looks and feels like new. After I left the shop I felt the difference in acceleration and I already had more MPG on my way home. At the stop light I couldn't even tell the car was on, it felt like I was in a hybrid, it idled so well. The throttle bottle cleaning and EFI cleaning really make a difference. You can see and feel the difference. It’s like night and day. He also details the vehicle, which my wife said she had never seen our rims so shiny. Dan backs up his work with photos of the work he is completing so you know exactly how everything looks and it allows you to compare before and after pictures. Dan was able to explain everything very thoroughly and gave us a lot of driving and maintenance tips to keep our vehicles running in top shape. Dan was very affordable for our 170k service especially considering all of the work that it needed done. He was able to catch a few things wrong with previous maintenance, such as loose plugs and a need for a new drain plug and re-thread of the drain hole in the drain pan.

If you take your car to the dealer, do yourself and your car a favor by going to Dan instead. I saved at least 50% from what the dealer would have charged me for all of the work Dan did on our 4runner. If you own a Toyota or Lexus you should definitely see Dan for excellent quality service at a good price. He only uses OEM Toyota parts and all work is done better than you would receive at the dealer. Dan is honest, transparent, quick to respond and does everything himself. He knows exactly what he is doing and certainly is a master Toyota mechanic. Dan is very professional and he e really cares about your vehicle and the well being of you and your family and your vehicle. I highly recommend you see Dan. You will be 100% satisfied. He also provides you with detailing and he even set me up with an Uber right home, out of town! His shop is also super clean and organized.

Thank you once again Dan for your excellent work! May your business continue to grow and prosper.</text>

You have kept your Rav4 to be in the 10/10 mint condition and shape, except for the engine was running a little rougher than normal and receiving low mpg's for the mileage that you have. I can help to apply the proper services to your Rav4 to make it run like new again, and importantly, increase your mpg's to be as high as the new Rav4. Anytime a Toyota, or Lexus vehicle has been properly serviced, you will then notice the increase in your mpg's and its new performance like a new vehicle. Once again, thank you Kathy for stopping by!"}< /Response>

Amazing Service!  I took my 2006 Rav4 in for an oil change and 110 mile service.  Dan, the owner and mechanic, is a true professional.  During the day he took pictures to show me the places where work was needed.  When I returned to pick up the car, it was washed and in mint condition.  On the way home, it felt as if I were driving a new car.  It had been running rough which I thought was just part of owning an older car.  Now I've decided to keep the Rav for a few more years.  Thank you Dan.<//review>

<Text>Dan, the shop owner, has been my mechanic since before he had a shop up in San Jose, CA.  My 2005 Camry is approaching 200K miles, yet runs reliably thanks to Dan's competence as a mechanic.  Over the years, my Camry's required some repairs (e.g. replaced the front catalytic converter & water pump) and general maintenance (e.g. oil change, fluids, new filters.)  Dan's done a great job and I'm greatly satisfied with the service he's provided. Plus, I've never felt ripped off or taken advantage by Dan, especially since Dan gives thorough answers and suggestions in replying to my questions--all without pressuring me to complete a sale. My car runs great. I'm sticking with Dan as my mechanic.

Dan knows all my Lexus vehicles inside out and backwards.  He is meticulous about using factor parts and fluids.  That has kept my vehicles working without a problem.  When I had one of the ignition coils fail (my unit has two) he tracked down the problem in my driveway to be sure I could get on the road again.  The average mechanic would never go to that much trouble to be sure a customer could keep running.  He is the kind of guy you keep coming back to year after year.< /Review>

Wow! Great find!! New shop in Visalia for those looking for service on their Hybrid, this guy was awesome. My Prius needed a quick oil change and Dan fit me in and got it done fast. No pressure or up selling. Gave me recommendations and an honest quote to compare. I recommend this shop highly.< /Text>

My car had a failing alternator and I Google searched for a mechanic who specializes in Lexus in the Visalia area and found Dan of TLD Auto Services.  Over the phone, Dan was very transparent and I immediately booked an appointment to have him diagnose my vehicle.  He was quick to narrow-down the issue and had the work done immediately.  He had via text pictures of the old and new parts and updated me with the progress.  He is honest and gave me recommendations for future upkeep which I really appreciate.  The service I had received was 100X better than the dealership.  He is very knowledgeable and solutions orientated not to mention an amazing down-to-earth disposition!  I will be going to Dan for all my vehicle maintenance from now on. I highly recommend him.  - Dr. Vang

Update 05/15/19.  I've returned to TLD for my vehicle's maintenance and every time I leave his shop, I know my vehicle is well taken care for and serviced well.  I appreciate that he uses OEM parts.  I have never been to a better mechanic who is upfront and honest.  I wish I could give Dan of TLD Auto Service 10 Stars!</text>

Dan is great knows in detail how to repair Lexus and toyotas will only reccomend the best factory parts for your vehicle. I had my Toyota Camry repaired at his shop with 450,000 miles on the odometer I thought it was beyond repair but Dan has kept it on the road. He is an excellent mechanic and cares about safety first I highly endorse his services<//text>

I needed a new Toyota mechanic for my 2003 Lexus. Dan definitely made a great impression as he told me how he was going to diagnose all the issues with my vehicle and keep me posted on the progress. I thought I was doing an ok job in keeping my car in shape but as I learned there was a lot more I could have done and Dan assured me that my car would run as if it was new. He sent me pics of all the issues he found due to wear and tear, improper repairs made by other mechanics and overall aging of some parts. Although he would not commit to telling me how much the total repairs would cost, he assured me that OEM parts would be used and he would give me a huge break in labor costs compared to a Lexus dealership. At the end, my car needed some extensive repairs and TLC but he saved me not hundreds, but thousands of dollars in labor costs. He provided me printouts of a Lexus dealership breakdown for parts and labor and his final bill was thousands of dollars less. Dan sent pics of all the OEM parts for the job, showed me the parts he replaced and pics as he torn down the engine. I can't say enough as to mechanical skills Dan has and the professionalism and pride he takes in his work. I'm a satisfied customer who will use Dan for all my Lexus and Toyota repairs and I highly recommend him. Thanks Dan. Ray Ramirez.</Review>

Found my technician for my '08 Prius!! Dan's great!! I initially talked to him about light service on my Prius,(ie: change spark plugs; check belts)... turned out that the water pump was leaking, oil was dirty, last shop was using wrong oil filter and drain plug gasket, transmission oil was dirty, both engine and electric motor coolant was old, A/C needed to be charged, etc....even the rear wiper insert was wrong!!  With my authorization, Dan replaced everything that needed replacement with Toyota OE parts. He even cleaned the engine compartment!! Needless to say that I spent more than I originally intended, but my Prius runs like new. Money well spent!! Every Toyota/Lexus owners will benefit from TLD service with Dan.< /review>

TLD Auto Service is owned and operated by Dan Nguyen, an extremely well trained Lexus and Toyota mechanic.  Dan is a one-of-a-kind mechanic that is truly committed to unparalleled customer service.
He proved himself after working on my 2012 Tundra which had a multitude of small issues that he quickly identified, diagnosed and  repaired within 24 hours.  I was truly impressed by the quality of his work including his efficient methods, strict attention to detail, use of OEM parts and transparency in the repairs he made.  The cost was surprisingly reasonable and VERY competitive.  It is abundantly  obvious that Dan has impeccable integrity and character.  He is honest, forthcoming, hard-working, possess superior knowledge of his craft and is dedicated to serving his customers to the best of his abilities.  I can only hope that Visalia doesn't lose such a great mechanic and person.<//review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>If you are looking for one of the most knowledgeable technicians in the Toyota and Lexus field... LOOK NO FURTHER. I had an issue with a repair of my own and hit a road block. Sent the vehicle to Dan after he took time away from his own work and came to my shop to give me some advice to help me do it on my own. I tried.. but couldn't.
So again, I sent the vehicle to Dan and he worked on it all night. He did this knowing I had a deadline too. In other words putting my work before his. He too had some issues but didn't give up. As he worked over the weekend he kept me updated and i knew ot was only a matter of time, my probkem would be solved. Well, he called me, and just as excited I was to hear it, he was to tell me... he got it!
This guy knows his stuff and is very passionate in his level of customer service all the way to his final product. Hands down an honest and great mechanic. You'll be pleased you took your Toyota and Lexus to the best guy in town, after your experience with Dan at TLD.
Thanks again Dan. I look forward to a great workimg relationship. You have my business.< /review>< user_id>

Came to Dan because when I met him I could tell he had a genuin passion for Toyotas, I have three myself. After talking to him you see that he’s an honest man. Says what he does and does what he says.  He not only fixes your car but has the heart of a teacher. Ask him anything. He makes time to explain what he’s doing and why he’s doing it. He pays attention to detail and it shows. Uses only genuine toyota parts and fluids straight from Toyota and has all his certifications hanging in the office. Labor rate is much more affordable than the dealer, which is ridiculously expensive. Overall had a great experience.< /Review>

He is honest, trustworthy, transparent and only uses OEM Toyota/Lexus parts. Dan explains everything to you and sends you before/after pictures of what he services on your vehicle. I plan on getting 400K+ miles out of my 4Runner and Dan is the man that will help me achieve those numbers. He educates you on how to keep your vehicle running in top shape and never sells you anything you don’t need. I won’t take my vehicles to any other mechanic.

After talking to Dan I thought ok, he sounds like he knows what he is talking about. I got an oil change and he washed my car. Sweet. I was not expecting that. Today I got my 100 thousand mile service and after today I am convinced I have found my new mechanic. Dan fully explained everything he was going to do and took pictures and sent them to my phone so I could see what he did and I got a car wash again. Dan will only use genuine Toyota parts and he is a certified Toyota mechanic. As far as I am concerned anybody in a 30 mile radius that needs a Toyota mechanic should come to Dan. He is knowledgeable, thourogh, and reasonable. If this is what you are looking for then Dan is your man.< /text><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44</gmap_id>< rating>

< review>
So I had my 4Runner tow back to TLD because I went to go buy a battery at auto-zone and they gave me the wrong battery and I accidentally cross the wires knowing that since auto-zone employees should know what they are doing but instead gave me a wrong battery and that burnt out most of the car fuse but TLD fixes the issue for me, plus when I got my car back it ran better than I had it. Can not ask for a better service then TLD. I have three cars and I will always take it to TLD if I can’t fix it myself. Been the dealer to fix my celica gts but they couldn’t find out why the lift wasn’t kicking in in high rpm. I kinda know why but the people who work at Toyota should know about Toyota but TLD knew what was wrong with it plus I figure it was the same issue too. The best thing is that we have TLD to fix our cars to make it to point A to B but not just that even beyond that. I just want to say TLD business is going to run forever. Any issue with your yota or Lexus take it there. Problem solve.</review>

<time>1544478052939</time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Once a month I travel from Southern California to a beautiful foothill community in Northern California.  I was a little over 2 and 1/2 hours into a 7 hour trip at 6:30 am on a Saturday when the Check Engine warning light and two other warning lights started flashing on my 2001 Lexus with nearly 236,000 miles on it.  I was 10 miles south of Tulare but decided to risk reaching Tulare to pull over for breakfast and to search for a Toyota/Lexus service shop.  The first entry on Google Search was TLD Auto Service, another 20 minutes away, and it was the only service shop that would be open on Saturday.  The nearest Lexus dealership is 50 miles away in Fresno.  I decided to risk the trip to TLD in Visalia knowing that if I broke down I could get AAA to tow me to TLD.  I made it there by 7:45 and put a call into the shop--no answer, but I left a message pleading my predicament.  At just past 8:30 Dan showed up with a smile on his face and his hand extended in greeting.  Dan is simply an absolutely delightful man.  He completely put me at ease while solving my problem and he patiently and thoroughly explained what had gone wrong and how to fix it.  He also performed a thorough check of the entire vehicle and pointed out to me what was right and what was wrong with the prior service that had been performed on the car.  He even convinced me that with proper service my car can easily make 400,000 miles.  I spent nearly 4 hours with Dan while he worked giving my car a thorough tune-up--sharing backgrounds (somehow I reminded him of his biology teacher in high school!?!), talking about family, hearing about his journey from San Jose to Visalia to provide the best life for his family, but most importantly hearing about his mantra for providing the absolute best service for his clients.  He will only use OEM parts, he will only charge a fair price, he will always thoroughly explain (and demonstrate through photographic documentation) what needs to be fixed on the vehicle.  As I will still be making round trips just past Visalia twice a month I will be booking appointments with Dan for him to perform all of the maintenance work on my Lexus.  He is so considerate that he offered to essentially chauffeur me (and my wife) to a nearby restaurant while we wait for the service to be performed.  Dan simply is the best that he can be and, quite honestly, he is the best!  Thank you Dan for saving my butt when I needed it and for being such a nice, warm, thoughtful person.<//review>< pictures>

I was fed up with taking my Highlander to the dealership, and my prayers were answered when I found TLD. Dan is the most professional, thorough, hardworking, and honest businessman and mechanic I have ever met. He explains everything and sends me pictures to show his work and support his diagnostic evaluation. Every time I take my baby for servicing, including some major work, my SUV seems to run even better. I can't emphasize enough how invaluable it is to have a reliable and efficient mechanic like Dan. Thank you!!!!< /review>

<Review>I was referred to TLD by a coworker after a horrible experience at my local dealership. The free oil changes that came with the vehicle were absolutely not worth the hassle and headache I experienced there. TLD was a total opposite, I dropped my truck off in the morning and received pricing and before any work was done. I continued to receive photos and updates all day of the status and was shocked at the detail and transparency of their business. I will never take my Toyota anywhere else, TLD was worth every penny and the staff could not possibly be more courteous and professional.</Review>< rate>

Dan and his crew at TLD Auto are the best, hands down!
Dan's a mechanic that wants to see your car last for as long as possible, he wants you and your car on the road, not in his shop with some repair needing done. He's also pro-active and not re-active. My car runs better than new, no joke! He went the extra mile to lubricate my hood latch so it wouldn't break, also sprayed a corrosion protection on my hybrid battery to make my battery last longer, explains everything he does and provides you with the necessary info to keep your car running PERFECT! I travel a lot for work and have taken several cars to mechanics and never seen someone so on top of everything. Tell me where you're going to find a mechanic that doesn't just fix what you came in for, but also prevents your car from getting worse?  Dan's the man!! I'll be bringing my Prius back to him regularly even though I'm not a local. Thanks for everything Dan & crew!< /review>

<text>While driving across country, my Lexus RX350 reported a warning that my AWD needed repair. The Fresno Lexus dealer never returned my phone calls, so I tried the second company suggested by my Google search… TLD. I’m so glad that I did. I’ve never felt as confident to recommend a business. Mr Nguyen worked me into his schedule, repaired my car, and treated me as professionally as anyone ever has. I firmly recommend him and his shop.< /text>< Pics>

The AC in my 2019 4Runner had stopped working effectively. It was just blowing hot air. Dan did a thorough maintenance on the car and my AC is working again! He also provided me photos of all the maintenance he did which was really helpful in understanding how bad all the fluids were. He even cleaned my car. It’s the cleanest my car has ever been. My car is running great now and the AC is blowing cold again! Thank you Dan!< /Text>

<text>If you own a Toyota or Lexus, just call Dan and look no further.  The amount of knowledge and experience Dan brings to the table is amazing.  He has treated my 2010 Tacoma like it's his own and genuinely wants me to keep my truck running for as long as possible.  I kid you not in saying that my truck is in better condition now than when I bought it used almost 10 years ago.  I seriously wish I had found Dan years ago.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<response>None<//response><Name>Michael Solomon<//Name><review>I brought my 2007 Lexus ES350 to TLD after reading the great reviews left by other clients. I was not happy with the quote for repairs I got from a Toyota dealership service. Dan was very helpful and explained to me in detail what services would be required, the parts and costs. He would routinely give me updates and send me photos. Never have I had this attention to detail with service repairs. I’m very happy I found this business and highly recommend for other Toyota and Lexus car owners to consider for their maintenance and their cars.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Very professional and thorough. Does an excellent job. Attention to detail is much better than the Toyota dealership. I will be going to Dan for now on. I have always taken my vehicles to the dealership and left feeling violated after all the fees and recommendations. Dan shows you before and after and his price is better than the dealership even with a coupon. Very happy with his service. Try it out. You won't be disappointed. Godbless and Godspeed<//text>

<Review>Dan is the best guy I ever meet in this auto repair business. My car broke down. He took me in the same day and inspected my car right away when he realizes we need to keep driving 6 hours to get home. He also taught me tons of tips on how to properly maintaining my old mr2 later at night. Look no further if you’re looking for a shop to fix your Toyota. He will treat you car like his own.< /Review>< username>

<Text>This was my husband"s car and I wasn't allowed to use it. I t s a beautiful sports coup 2004 Lexus. I had battery issues and the car had not  been used in over a year.. Dan brought it back to it"s beauty and it is a lovely car to drive. He has walked me through what i need to do to keep it up, and he is very reasonably priced</Text>< userid>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Even though I do not live near Dan’s service—I live in Washington state— he came so well-recommended to me (he is known far and wide) that I reached out to him for some professional telephone advice on my cherished 1992 Previa.  Not only was he responsive, he also gave me the expert advice for which i was searching AND not only was it comprehensive and correct, he never asked for a penny and stayed with me throughout my entire ordeal.  Dan really cares and is passionate about his knowledge.  If ever in Visalia, I owe this gentleman a huge hug of gratitude.<//text>< Pics>

We needed to do a smog to transfer title and the dreaded check engine light came on. Trying to find a place to take it to other than the dealer and found Dan at TLD Auto Service.  I sent him a message about 9:00 pm and I didn't expect to hear back until the next day and a minute later he sent a message back, I was stunned. He told me to bring it in and the would check it out. They found the problem and fixed it without the big price tag of a dealer. He kept me informed of everything they were doing and even sent pictures of everything. He made recommendations of what we need to do in the future and also sent more pictures and many tips through a text message. You will not find that kind of service through a big box store. He definitely went above and beyond! He even did a follow the next day to see if everything was ok.
This man eats sleeps and breathes his business.
They even washed the car. I will definitely be back and 100 percent recommend him to anyone.<//Review>< Pics>

The BEST SERVICE EXPERIENCE, Dan is by far the best mechanic for my car! My 2016 toyota hit 100,000 a couple months ago, it was due for maintenance REAL bad. I was really trying to save to take it in to dealer or find a good mechanic. I asked around and a good friend gave me Dan's number!
This man knows his stuff! But most of all he is Honest. This is so hard to come by. My car is driving so smooth just like the first day I bought it. Thank you so much Dan, we need more people like you!
You have gained us as your customers!< /review>

<Review>Dan is VERY PROFESSIONAL and an awesome mechanic.  First time going there, I have an older Toyota with high mileage.  Internal oil leak, thought about going to another mechanic but thought I’d try out a Toyota specialist.  Very happy with my service, car runs like it’s brand new!  Highly referred to anyone owning a TOYOTA/LEXUS!!!<//Review><date>1620358763164<//date>< rate>

Highly recommend TLD, Dan is great. Very knowledgeable and outstanding work, better than any dealer experience I've ever had. He diagnosed the problem with my Tundra quickly. Communication was very good and kept me up to date. Price was fair and he only uses quality OEM parts. You can definitely see pride in his workmanship and quality. Gives a lot of helpful info on preventative maintenance.

Also, Dan really goes above and beyond for customer service, which seems to unfortunately be a rarity in these type of businesses. After diagnosing the problem with my truck, he looked up info to see if the problem was covered under Toyota warranty since it was going to be expensive. Unfortunately it wasn't. He even put gas in the truck out of his own pocket, since it was low, while test driving because he was concerned about how bad that is for fuel system.  Will definitely be going to Dan for all my Toyota/Lexus repairs and maintenance.<//Review>

<text>If you have a Toyota or Lexus, look no further than TLD Auto for service or maintenance. Dan is one of the most professional people that you will meet. He goes above and beyond on your vehicle and goes out of his way to explain things. He really does care about customer service and your car's longevity. I took my 2005 Tacoma in and was pleased with the work that Dan did. A bonus was that after Dan cleaned the fuel system, I noticed a significant power increase! I really can't say enough other than you won't be disappointed.< /text>< Pics>

I used to take my Lexus RX450H to the dealership. I was really happy when I finally found a local shop with excellent reviews. My experience when I took my car to TLD Auto Service was just as described in the reviews. Dan is a professional, he’s very knowledgeable and does quality work. Dan has a heart of a teacher and described in detail what my car needed. The communication was excellent every step of the way (including texts and photos). I also feel that I can take better care of my own hybrid vehicle with all the recommendations that Dan provided. I’m confident my car is in the best hands of someone who really knows what they are doing and truly cares.  I’m so grateful of finding this place and I highly recommend it!!</review>

<Review>I rarely take the time to post reviews; however,  Dan and his business are well deserving of this review.

First of, finding an honest and dependable mechanic nowadays is extremely rare.  Between my family and I, we utilize 6 cars; therefore, I truly believe in preventative maintenance, and have dealt with many auto services shops.

I learned about TLD Auto Service after purchasing a 1998 Lexus ES 300.  I purchased the Lexus for commuting purposes.  As many of us do, I jumped on Google and searched for a mechanic who specialized in Lexus.  This is where I learned of TLD.  I read the reviews and decided to give TLD the opportunity to service my Lexus.

I met Dan for the first time when dropping of the Lexus for service.  This was the first Lexus I had owned; however, Dan gave me an educational class on my Lexus.  Not many mechanics will take the time to do this.  Time is money!  Right?  Well, with Dan, I learned he also wants you ( the customer) to know the ins/outs of your car.  I left the Lexus with Dan for the completion of a major service.

The major service took about 2 days considering the delivery of parts.  When I picked up the car,  the first thing I noticed was that my Lexus was washed and interior clean.  The exterior of my Lexus was extremely dirty when I had initially dropped it off.

I stepped into Dan's Office and he stated, "Hey, help yourself to anything you want in the fridge."  It was hot, so I took him up on his offer and made a selection from various drinks.

Shortly after, Dan took me outside to my Lexus and went over the work he had completed.  I was sold when he showed me (and later texted me) pictures (before and after) of the work he had completed.

After a tour of my car, we went to Dan's Office where I payed the bill for his service.  Although I will not disclose the amount, I was surprised at the amount due based on all the work he had completed.  Dan took the time to explain each service completed.  I truly was expecting to pay much more based on previous experiences.  Dan's price was beyond reasonable.

As I previously stated, my family operates 6 vehicles, which not all are Lexus or Toyota; however, the vehicles that are, I always call Dan for services and he is able to accommodate me.  I ONLY WISH HE SPECIALIZED IN OTHER MAKES!!!

In summary, if you own a Lexus or Toyota, and are looking for an honest and reliable autoshop to perform quality service, I highly recommmend TLD Auto Service.

Thanks again Dan for your service!</Review><Time>1627533516035< /Time><username>pedro chanelo</username>< response>

<Review>I will not take my Toyota Tacoma anywhere else. Dan is very detailed oriented. He is transparent about the work he performs on your vehicle and cares about you as a customer.  You can tell that he loves what he does and it reflects in his work. He takes the time to answer any questions you may have and will let you know the dos and don’ts of taking care of your Toyota.</Review>< Time>

I work and live in the Central Valley, I want to do business with local business owners. I research shops for the work I needed, then started to call around. Dan advertised certified Toyota Repairs and agreed to take my car in. 2013 Prius needed Head gasket and related repairs done. Other shops referred me back to the dealership.
I met Dan a couple of times and each time he was busy but took the time to tell me his plan for the repairs and showed me pictures of the damage I most likely have. In the end I received pictures of the work done, looked at the head before it went to machine shop , and received a vehicle back that is running great. I will remain a customer of TLD Auto Services, and look forward to a long friendship with this local owner.
Thank you Dan for all you did , Celaya family.< /Text>

I own a Lexus and my husband has two Toyotas. Dan has worked on all three and we could not be happier. Much more convenient than going all the way to Fresno Lexus for service. He recently did a full clutch repair and tuneup on my husbands 20 yr old Tacoma and he says it runs like new again! Dan always uses genuine Lexus and Toyota parts. Dan will treat your car as if it were his own.<//Text>

This shop has it all!! Service is superb and the shop is impeccable.  Dan is highly skilled, and nothing short of amazing. He is willing to take the time to explain and prioritize needed repairs.  I took in my 2003 Lexus RX 300; I am relieved to have found someone who is honest, punctual, and of integral character to take care of my car.   My car drives and feels like new once again!  I look forward to continue doing business with TLD team.< /Text>

If you want your Toyota/Lexus serviced by an excellent mechanic, go see Dan at TLD. I took my Lexus RX450h to TLD for the 120K mile suggested maintenance and was pleased and delighted with the outcome. My SUV is 10 years old and has never run so smooth. Added to that, the price for this extensive service was less than that quoted by Fresno Lexus. I have every confidence that Dan will keep my Lexus running for many years to come. The place to go for excellent customer service and all your car needs is Toyota Lexus Diagnostic.<//review>

I just got my Toyota Venza service at TLD. I had my car transmission fluid flush.  Dan is the mechanic and the owner. He is very honest, professional and friendly person. He uses the quality products for the car. He gives quality works and his honestly is over the top. He has pride in his works (I could tell). And the best of all the price is very reasonable. From what I had experienced with car serviced at TLD, I'm sure will be client for life as long as I still have my Toyota. I would recommend my friends and families to use service at TLD AUTO. THANK YOU again DAN.</Review>

I have a 2006 Lexus GS300 that I’ve had since it was new. Numerous mechanics worked on it. Dan found problems with their sloppy work and fixed my bad alternator. He flushed the radiator, engine oil and cleaned the fuel engine system. His work was fast, clean and extremely well done. He founds other issues that were overlooked in the past and fixed them. His price was extremely good too.

I highly recommend him for all your Lexus/Toyota issues.<//text>

Dan exceeded all my expectations regarding my Prius V that required major work done. The most important characteristic I look for in service is a sense of ownership. Dan goes into excruciating detail into how, what, why, when and where regarding the work done on your vehicle. Updated photographs and preventative protocols is part of the service. Dan is not looking for a quick fix, he wants a long term relationship with customers indicated through the quality and longevity of his work. I wish I could keep him as my little secret, but he is too damn good.<//Review>

Dan and the team at TLD Auto were a true lifesaver for us!  Our Prius 2004 needed battery replacement and Dan got to work on it quickly.  Dan took great care to keep us informed on what repairs would be necessary and was very upfront about the different options as it relates to price.  Dan took great care in fixing up our Prius and getting her back on the road quickly, affordably.  Dan has a great eye for detail and taught us a lot about how to get better efficiency out of our vehicle.  Dan went over  line by line explaining what was included in our bill and took time with us to make sure we were 100% satisfied.  We will be coming back to his shop from now on...I’m skipping the expensive dealership from now on.

TLD is the best shop in town for your Lexus or Toyota. Dan's customer service is excellent, and he truly gives you a dealer-like experience. I took my wife's Lexus ES350 to him for a brake job, and he did an excellent job - he even pointed out issues that I was unaware of from services performed by others from the previous owner. Whether it's just a regular oil change or a transmission replacement - he can do it all!!! Go check him out, you'll be glad you did.</Text>

I was on a family trip to Sequoia National Park, when my Toyota Sienna broke down. Thank god I found Dan from TLD. He was able to take the car in right away and meticulously examined every single part of the car. He located the problem and immediately placed an order for parts from a quality factory. I appreciated that he had experience working with Toyota and Lexus directly for over 12 years. Let me just say he does not skip steps, cut corners, or use cheap parts. His craftsmanship is impeccable and his attention to detail is impressive. Although it was an older family car, he treated it with the utmost respect and care as if it was his own child. We ended up renting a car so we could continue our family trip. Throughout the trip, I would get continuous updates from Dan via text. He was very communicative every step of the way. The shop was closed the day we returned from our trip and Dan went out of his way to open the store and accommodate us. When I received the final bill, I was given an itemized receipt with line by line details along with accompanying photos. Everything was done with honesty and integrity so I did not once feel cheated. He even washed the car for me! Post-trip I would get follow up texts from Dan to ensure everything was still running smoothly. A few months later, I had a minor problem (completely separate from what Dan fixed) and texted Dan. He, of course, responded back immediately and talked me through my options.

This is the first time I have ever left a review for an auto shop because I think this is an outstanding small business and Dan is an incredible business owner. I only wish I lived closer so that all of my cars can get the TLD treatment.<//Text>

Dan is very skilled in both Toyota repair and customer service. He prioritized what was needed to repair my vehicle and then did the work. He supplied pictures as well as texted his recommendations for future work. Vehicle was ready when he said it would be. I will recommend his business to my Toyota owning friends.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I was referred to TLD Auto Service.  I am very pleased with the high level of quality, service and workmanship Dan did on my car. Dan explained everything thoroughly,  provided in detail a breakdown of the work I needed on my car, costs, and why.  He did an impeccable job and I will definitely be taking my car back.
If you have a Toyota in need of service,  come to this place. It's hard to find a good mechanic nowadays especially someone who is honest, professional, ethical and takes pride in their work.
I highly recommend Dan.<//Text>< pics>

I’ve been a mechanic for over 40 years and have always been very stringent of who I’d let preform specific repairs on my cars, trucks and equipment besides myself. I’ve determined Dan’s one of the most knowledgeable and technical mechanics I’ve met. His attention to detail and giving the customer value exceeds every other mechanic shop in the Valley and any otherToyota dealers of which 5 different ones I’ve had service at. He cares more about your vehicle then most care about there own vehicle, which creates a huge value to the customer. When compared to the dealers and major repairs he is at a 5%-15 % discount to a Toyota dealer and he provides a superior workmanship. I never, until now had the pleasure of such a dedicated individual as Dan and TLD Auto; with the highest customer service as Dan.

I’ve only known Dan for 7-8 month while doing business with him for my vehicle(s) along with my son who drives down from Fresno to have work done on there 2 Toyota’s. Dan has one of the highest integrity and workmanship that’s incredibly hard to find anywhere in a individual or any business!  I normally give 3-4 star rating  to any other service shop that preforms good to quality work but TLD and Dan easily deserve 5 Stars!

<Review>I recently received my first car. My dad insisted we would take my Toyota to TLD. Upon our arrival Dan greeted us with such hospitality offering us cold water. He then explained what work should be done, informed us more about my car, and ensured that it was left in great hands. Picking up my car the first thing I noticed was how clean my vehicle looked. The engine and compartment was thoroughly detailed and looked new. The car idled quietly and smoothly unlike before. Being a new driver, Dan thorough explained and shared some tips that would increase the longevity of my Toyota. I am pleased to say that Dan is not only my dads mechanic, but mine as well! I look forward to the many year service with TLD.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

Halfway into a 6 hour road trip, my Prius flashed the red triangle of death. It was after 5 and so many locations were closed, so thank GOD that TLD was open and close. Turns out my water pump pooped out. TLD went over and above to make sure we could get back on the road and not have to stay the night in Visalia. We watched Netflix and drank soda while they took care of everything. They even steam cleaned my engine and wiped down my doors and hood! They gave me all kinds of tips to make sure I’m getting the best fuel economy and ensuring my Toyota has a long life. They are GODSENDS, I tell you! There’s a reason why they have only 5 star reviews!!< /text>

<Text>I brought my 2014 Camry to Dan's Shop for a 100k mile full maintenance and man this bad boy runs like new all over again. Dan did a fantastic job, good quality maintenance performed by someone that actually cares for his customers, not to mention all parts that he uses are OEM. I will most definitely be bringing my Camry back for every routine maintenance and/or repairs.<//Text>< pictures>

It needed a lot attended to and he jumped in when others before finding him told me my car wasn’t worth fixing. So many positive reviews I’ve read from others say all I’d be adding here also. So just read for yourself. This is the guy for your Toyota. Thank You Dan!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dan is very skilled in both Toyota repair and customer service. He prioritized what was needed to repair my vehicle and then did the work. He supplied pictures as well as texted his recommendations for future work. Vehicle was ready when he said it would be. I will recommend his business to my Toyota owning friends.< /review>< Pictures>

The best mechanic I have ever done business with, he knows toyota's like the back of his hand. He is very pleasant and extremely honest, he explains everything he does and sends photos of all his repairs/diagnostic procedures, even gives you a box of all your old parts. His prices reflect with accuracy of repairs and goes above and beyond to try to help his customers out by reducing charges wherever he can. This business in my opinion is worth more than a five star rating.<//text>

If you have a Toyota in need of service,  come to this place. It's hard to find a good mechanic nowadays especially someone who is honest, professional, ethical and takes pride in their work.
I highly recommend Dan.< /text><user>104325615489907790481<//user><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Being from out of town and needing assistance I looked on the web and found TLD.  I didn't know how lucky I was to find this wonderful business.  Dan was professional, friendly, and prompt.  I will recommend his business to all my relatives and friends here in the valley.  Thank you Dan for taking care of my issue even though I did not have a prescheduled appointment.< /Review>

< Review>
I live in Hanford, 24 miles from TLD Auto. A friend of mine from work suggested IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE DRIVE to have Dan work on my 2007, Toyota Corolla. Long story short,  I now have a new  specialized Toyota mechanic, Dan, from TLD Auto service! Everything about TLD, 100% PROFESSIONAL from customer service to exceptional quality of work! If you don't live in Visalia, like my co-worker said, IT WOULD BE WORTH THE DRIVE!! TLD Auto Service takes a lot of pride in servicing my Toyota! I highly recommend, TLD Auto Service!< /Review>

How many 5 star reviews do you need to read before you decide to make an appointment? Once Dan works on your car, you won’t want anyone else to touch it. You can tell he cares deeply about the cars he works on. He takes a holistic approach to proper maintenance, catching bad things before they happen. He will educate you about what he does and why (if you are oblivious to cars like me) and will send you photos of what he’s done. He did a huge amount of work on my highlander hybrid, including replacing the suspension. Honest, easy to talk to, and a super hard worker.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Dan was recommended by a friend when I needed some work done on my 07 Tacoma. I didn’t know much about the history of my truck as I bought it used and I questioned the care it received from the previous owner. Dan was able to help me focus on what the priorities were and assess the needs and how to approach it in a cost-effective manner. He didn’t just tell me what he saw, he showed me. Dan knows his stuff when it comes to Toyota/Lexus. I learned so much about the needs of my truck, how it functions and I could help it run better and last longer. Dan is not just a mechanic, he is also a teacher. He doesn’t just care about getting something fixed quickly, he cares about the details and getting it done right, with the right parts and ensuring that you understand what’s being done and why. Also, in the end he saved me money, but the best part is that my truck has never run better and I’ve never been more comfortable or confident in its performance.</text>< Pics>

If you are looking for a reliable, honest and informative tech who knows the Toyota/Lexus line, you have found it...  Not only was Dan very informative, his process on the way He diagnosis you car is impeccable. His understanding of the differences between repair/maintain, will allow you to care for your car and maintain it for years to come. I give 5 ⭐️ without hesitation as his service, advise and overall precision on workmanship was outstanding. Thanks again Dan. Will return soon with maintaining my Lexus. 👍🏼< /text>

I took my vehicle for a check up and right from the start Dan was attentive to all of my concerns. He patiently went over in detail what he recommended to be done and was not pushy about anything. When I picked up my vehicle he had a detailed description as well as photos of everything that he performed on the vehicle. The vehicle was meticulously cared for and he even steam cleaned the entire engine as a customer courtesy. I was also pleased to know that he holds a Senior Master Technician Credential from Toyota. I drove the vehicle and was highly surprised with the major difference in performance! I will be recommending Dan to all of my family and friends while looking forward to my next visit to TLD Auto Service!</Text>

Needed 100k plus mile service on our 2005 Prius.   Dan was highly recommended by friends and other service people in his field.   After meeting and dealing with Dan, I understand why, and completely agree!  Not only is he experienced and knowledgeable,  he shares his knowledge and shows you What and Why the work is needed on your vehicle.   He also has the best Rate.  Thank you Dan!  We will be back for more of your great service,  my car is running like she is new!</Text>

My wife and I took our 2005 Lexus GX470 to Dan to get the timing belt replaced, and to source an oil leak.  Dan knew right away what to look for, and kept the car for a day so he could make sure he could order all the parts he'd need to complete the job.  He gave us the car back w/ the oil changed and instructions not to drive too much while he waited for the Lexus parts to arrive from the dealer.  Yes that's right, Dan only uses Lexus/Toyota/OEM parts, super critical!  Once the parts came in, Dan let us know to come back and he promptly performed the work and got us back on the road w/o a hitch!  Dan even took care of some poor pricing from the Toyota dealer for us, a nice touch!  This is the only place I'd take our primary vehicle from here on out - thank you Dan and see you in about 2k miles for an oil change, you've got customers for life! :)</review>

These stellar reviews are legit.  Dan is a good human and it is reflected in his customer service, professionalism, and knowledge.  In fact, he sets the standard.  My experience with Dan at TLD is with scheduled maintenance and he couldn’t have been more thorough and he even took the time to educate me about my Prius and offered simple ways to extend it’s life and improve it’s performance with simple everyday practices and habits and now I care a lot more about taking care of it.  Seriously, his caring is contagious and his integrity is truly inspirational!<//Text>

<Review>I took my car to TLD Auto Service for a diagnosis. My car has been shaking quite harshly, so it was getting unsafe to drive. Dan was kind enough to fit me into his schedule even though he was backed up.
He kept me posted on all the issues with the car and I further proceeded to have him work on the car. Dan is easy to talk to and is very thorough in his work. He clearly explained each line item on my invoice and gave images for the items. Overall I am glad I came to this shop and would gladly come back in the future.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Last week I took my 2013 (99,000 mile) Lexus to TLD for service, as there were several issues that needed attention. Dan was extremely thorough, explaining all items in advance. He updated me prior starting any work and completed everything in the projected time. He even followed up the visit with photos of each step and matched it to my invoice — line item by line item. Great price, outstanding customer service and the car runs better than it ever has since purchasing it used with 13,000 miles on it from a Lexus dealer. Thank you, Dan!< /Text>

I’ve been to numerous mechanics over the years, but I’ve never encountered a mechanic like Dan. Dan isn't just an expert mechanic, he’s passionate about what he does and cares deeply about his customers. I’m not exaggerating when I say he treats your vehicle like his own and treats you like a lifelong friend.

Aside from my routine oil change, he cleaned the vehicle exterior and my engine bay (which was mired in dust, causing issues with temperature control), caught some potential problems (that I was oblivious to) and spared me from what would have inevitability been a serious and costly failure in the near future.  For my business, I depend on my vehicle working, to keep me working. Dan’s quality service gives me confidence that I my vehicle and I will continue to get the job done. And thanks to Dan’s wealth of knowledge, I’ve come away with a greater understanding and appreciation of my vehicle.

It’s difficult to adequately express how nice it feels to have found a mechanic who I can totally trust to have my best interest at heart. Dan has raised the bar so high, I fear that I’ll be disappointed if I ever have to take my Toyota Tacoma to any other mechanic. Thank you Dan!!</Text>

<Text>I was recommended to go to Dan by my sales person who sold me my Lexus. I was really happy he did so because not only did it save me a whole 1 hour trip to the nearest Lexus dealership I would have missed out on his great customer service! Immediately you can tell how passionate Dan is with his work! He is very educated and knows what he’s doing! I definitely recommend TLD Auto Service to all these who have a Lexus or Toyota! He provides picture text messages of before and after whatever he fixes. He really goes above and beyond and explains to you what needs to be done now and what can wait for the future! He cares a lot about his costumers, you could never find what Dan does at any other dealership. He’s the real definition of great costumer service!< /Text>< pictures>

I brought my car to this shop with concerns about a strange noise that it was making, and Dan was able to quickly diagnose and solve the issue. I had a wonderful experience at this business and will definitely come back to Dan when I have any other problems with my vehicle! Highly recommend.< /text>

<review>My vehicle arrived at TLD Auto Service on the back of a tow truck.  From the moment my truck was there Dan was very attentive to me and addressed all of my concerns.  He got my truck back on the road and it has never run better.  I will us TLD for all my service in the future and have already recommended him to my friends.  He is very honest and truly cares for your vehicle and his customers.  If I could give him more than 5 stars I would.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I always thought I maintained my 2013 Prius until I went to Dan at TLD. Dan demonstrated that while I was going to my dealer, I was not necessarily getting what I was supposed to from the mechanic. With both before and after pictures, he showed me what my car was really supposed to look like once a proper procedure was completed. My car has more power and runs smoother than ever before. I am a total believer in this man. If that isn’t enough, his prices are far below what I have paid previously. He is more than fair and I could not be happier.< /Review>

<Review>Dan is truly one of a kind. I’m not exaggerating. He treats my car like it’s his own personal baby. He took care to analyze the problems and listed them one by one by text with photos. He’s super kind and even dropped the car off at my house once I got home late in the evening because I was driving back from the Bay Area. He was going to Uber back but I insisted on driving him back to the shop. He talked to me about my car and the plan to get it running perfectly again now that I will be using the higher quality fuel as he suggested. He threw a few things in to make it more affordable since it was such a high cost. That’s just so nice. He doesn’t have to do that. He’s amazing. I’m just so thrilled and grateful that I have access to this talented and skilled honest human being of exemplary character. Seriously. Thankful.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I found Dan by accident, lucky for me. Dan explained and showed me everything he was doing. Afterward, the difference on how my 2006 Lexus performed was amazing. Drives like it did on the day I bought it new. His customer service is beyond anything I had experience with Fresno Lexus. Dan exceeded my expectations in every area. Service, quality, and cost all rate 5 stars.< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dan is a genius with a Toyota. After 262,000 miles dan  has it running like it was off the showroom floor. He will sit with you and explain what he is going to do to your vehicle in simple terms so you understand without talking down to you, and th n when he is finished he’ll show pictures of what it looked like before and after. If you have a Toyota, Dan is the man.  If you just bought a Toyota take it to him and let him tell you what you should do to keep it in great shape that the dealership won’t. It is worth it, if I had only known that when I bought it. Worth every penny. Thanks so much Dan.<//Review>

Ask him anything about your car and he knows the history of how and why Toyota made something in a specific manner. He will keep you updated on every minute detail of your maintenance and repairs. A good mechanic is hard to find, and an honest one is a treasure.

<review>We own a 1999 Lexus RX300 that was unable to pass smog and more than likely was on its way to the salvage yard, but we gave Dan one last crack at it.  After Dan was able to fix it, and the Smog Check Co told me that it passed with better numbers than a new car would!!!

Dan is the Best and now my 2008 Toyota Highlander has had the royal treatment, it runs like new!!!!

If you own a Toyota or Lexus, Don't take it Anywhere Else!!!</review>< pictures>

I found Dan to be  honest and informative, with incredible work ethic.  He is highly skilled, experienced and knowledgable about any car issue imaginable.  He serviced my vehicle with impeccable care and cleanliness.  He takes pride in a job well done and ensures that the work done on your car is top quality.  Without hesitation, even though commuting from Bakersfield, I will return to Dan for any mechanical maintenance or services needed.<//Text>

I drove all the way from Sacramento to have my Avalon serviced by Dan after hearing about his excellent service record

I was not disappointed!!

He exceeded my expectations.  The Roseville Toyota dealer quoted $1800 to perform a task that Dan performed for $155!!!

Not only did he fix that problem but he also (without asking) got the pesky “check tire pressure light” to go off.

I highly recommend TLD!!</Text>

<review>I highly recommend Dan to everyone!!! I was doing some research thanks to Google I end up on his website reading good reviews about his business. Had better reviews than the Toyota/Lexus dealership. So I decided to go, took my lexus. And yeah he knows what his doing, explains everything step by step. Honest/polite, knows what his doing to your car.
If you got Toyota/Lexus just go to TLD for better service.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Very professional. He's really experienced and is very knowledgeable. I know I can trust leaving my car with him, with many problems, and know I will get it back in great condition with the problems fixed and the issues addressed properly. I have a Toyota Prius and I highly suggest that if you have a Toyota, no in Visalia can give you better business than TLD. Thank you Dan!</text>

Dan was very thorough and timely when repairing my parents' 2008 Scion xD. The work was completed without any surprises and he was realistic with the cost estimate. The shop is clean and the service was exceptional. He's a great guy with a great attitude and he treats his customers with care. We'll definitely be back to complete additional repairs and for regular maintenance. Thank you, Dan!< /Text>

I have never found a mechanic quite like Dan. He takes pride in his work and he won't do a subpar job on your vehicle. His work is impeccable and you can trust that the work he says your car needs is what  gets done. He's not the cheapest mechanic in town, but if you're looking for a bargain versus quality work, you get what you pay for. I'm not taking my 4 runner anywhere else but to TLD Auto service.< /review>

I took my Lexus to Dan at TLD Auto Service to find out why the “check engine” light was coming on. Not only did he find and fix the problem, within 30 minutes, but he went above and beyond that...to check other parts on the vehicle and to give me tips about when to have certain parts checked or changed. He also gave me some vital information about my battery size. I was very impressed with his efficiency, knowledge and character. I would definitely recommend Dan to my family and friends or any Toyota/Lexus owner.< /text>

Took my car to Dan for the first time and glad I did. He really knows his business. He not only fixes your car the right way, he'll also help you with advice so you can keep your car running at it's best. I drove away with confidence knowing my car was serviced and repaired the way it should be.   Thanks Dan, will definitely be going back.<//Review>

Over the past year I have spent several thousand dollars on car repairs with the issue not being fixed, or -unknown to me- only temporarily fixed and other issues created. My car had been to the shop every several months. The morning I took my car to Dan, he met me at my car and while we were talking he asked me to open my hood...he smelled something. My alternator was on fire! He quickly disconnected my battery before any other damage occurred.  I left the car and quickly learned how passionate Dan is about providing excellent service. He constantly updated me and sent pictures. His integrity is second to none. That is not something I have seen in many, many years! He went well above and beyond to provide excellent service. When I picked up the car EVERYTHING  was better than when I took it in. He even steam cleaned the engine, did an exterior wash and cleaned all of my floor mats. He repaired what the others had done incorrectly and fixed things they couldn't. I feel blessed to have found him when I did.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dan is a gem! He goes above & beyond the call of duty to give great service to your Toyota at very fair prices. He explains everything in detail and provides lots of pictures of what he's doing as he works on your car. He works with you to prioritize what needs repairing now and what can wait. Couldn't ask for a better or more honest or skilled mechanic! Five plus stars!<//Text>

<Review>Took my Lexus to TLD last week for complete front brake job and Dan did a phenomenal job on it. He took his time and he really took pride in his work. When I got my car back, it was washed, engine compartment cleaned like new, brakes feels brand new. Dan did an awesome job. Will definitely bring my car again.< /Review>< username>

This is best auto service I've ever experienced in my life.  He's very honest and front. He backs up his work with pictures of before and after.  While educating you on what you should look for in a mechanic/auto service.  He will not up sale you on what you don't need. He gladly explains everything he's doing.  I truly highly recommend TLD AUTO SERVICE for your Toyota or Lexus.< /Review>

<text>I am a college student and I own a 2000 Lexus RX 300. I was referred to TLD Auto Repair with Dan and I appreciate his flexibility with my schedule and his affordable pricing. I like that he works on reliable cars like Toyota and Lexus and uses genuine and authentic parts. He is always sending pictures which was super great to me because it shows how much of an honest person he is. He was always transparent. I will definitely use him again.</text>< pics>

Yes, I was once in college and no one helped me to get my vehicle running right to achieve the highest mpg's as possible. I didn't have all the money for gas so I needed every drop of fuel and oils to last me as long as possible. I was commuting from work to school and back to my apartment was about 105 miles a day to be exact. Your RX300 has its age, but no matter how high the mileage will accumulate because I will help you to keep it running close to perfect for a peace of mind for you to finish your school. And after the graduation, I will still help to keep it going as long as you'd like tooo... Thanks again Bridget for your time to come in and have a great school year!"}<//resp></record>

Dan is one of the best ever! First time taking my Lexus for maintenance and very glad I found him! He was so educated and very informing about what is best for your car and how you can save money! Will go over what needs replacing and fixing and will not preform any service without your permission. Dan will also text you with updates and send before and after photos. He is so dedicated and passionate about his work that you know after meeting him you will get quality work and guarantees your car will drive better afterwards. Will recommend him to anyone that has a Lexus/Toyota in the area that needs service and a trusted mechanic.< /Text>

Dan is an amazing, honest mechanic. And truly takes pride in his work and costumer experience! He made my 2010 Toyota Camry feel like a brand new Lexus! I am beyond thankful for his work and knowledge. I will continue to bring him my business and encourage any Toyota/Lexus owners to do the same. If your looking for a mechanic, look no further!< /Review>

We encountered Dan as a result of looking at his excellent reviews. Dan is extremely detailed in his work and will explain what is needed and offers you the option of making decisions. He is reliable and dependable and have been back several time due to his great customer service! Will continue to come back and continue to refer friends and family!</Review>

<name>Arthur Garza< /name><Date>1580358447797</Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>I recently took my 2004 Toyota Tundra to TLD (Toyota, Lexus, Diagnostic - Hybrid) in Visalia for service by owner Dan T. Nguyen, Master Certified Technician. I must say I have never been treated as well as Dan treated me during my visit. He was friendly, attentive, and very informed on all things Toyota. From the way he presented himself to how his equipment and shop is maintained, says volumes about what a real professional he is. When I picked up my truck it was running at idle, very quietly and smooth. The engine compartment was freshly power washed, (at no cost to me) and looked amazing. As assured by Dan prior to service, my truck now responds and performs like new since I took it to TLD. As a longtime owner of many Toyotas, I can honestly say Dan is truly one of the best. Thanks TLD!</review>< pics>

Dan is a highly professional individual who enjoys his work tremendously. I fee lucky to have met and have him take care of my Lexus. Since the service the car drives like a brand new car even with 125,000 miles on it already. I had been to various dealerships in my lifetime and I will never switch services with any body else. I would say he is honest, definitely competent and a very true and sincere friend. May his business thrive and continue to grow.</review>

<Review>Dan is all about 100% costumer service! He’s honest, friendly, and a very humble person. He is an excellent technician and we highly recommend his services to anyone who has a Toyota or Lexus. He is very detailed in his work and took before and after pictures of all the work he did on my Highlander. We are very happy with his services and will only be going to him. He’s also way cheaper than Toyota Auto Services! We are very happy with his services!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I took my girlfriends corolla as well as her grandma and mother’s Lexus’s to Dan for tune ups and oil changes. He went above and beyond to give the best service possible and it was shown by a noticeable difference in the vehicles serviced. He takes pictures of all work and proves the work is done by sending before and after pictures by text. Dan’s work is better than the dealer for your Lexus or Toyota.< /review>

Dan is fantastic. He is the best mechanic I’ve ever met. When he works on your vehicle he treats it as if it was his own. He documents all work performed and takes time to explain via pictures what he’s doing and why. My Toyota drives better than ever. You owe it to yourself to go to Dan if you own a Toyota or Lexus.< /Review>

There's a reason Dan hasn't received a single review lower than 5 stars which is amazing in itself--Dan gives amazing service every time!  The extra touches he provides such as car and engine washes, pickups and drop offs, aren't extra touches to him but just part of the experience. Who else does this??? No one. I've been to him 4 or 5 times and hesitated writing a review because he's one guy and if everyone takes their car to him, naturally his time and attention to my vehicle will decrease right?? Well, the 5 star reviews and new customers keep coming in but the service remains superb and like no one else!! He has saved me so much time and money not just on my car, but being able to continue to work without down time and avoiding car-tastrophies.<//Text>

He kept me updated throughout the whole time he was working on my car, he was honest about what my car needed, the overall cost was extremely reasonable for all the work he did, and everything he did was fast and done correctly! Dan is very knowledgeable and friendly and I would definitely recommend him to any Toyota or Lexus owners!</Text>

I am so glad that I found Dan at TLD auto service. I got my highlander serviced here for 30k miles maintenance, he did a very outstanding work on it. My car runs so much better than before! He explained to me what was replaced and how to keep the car running smoothly. I also really like how he informed me what’s been done to the car so I know exactly what was replaced. Not only that he is a master technician, he is a very kind and humble as a person too which is always a plus! I definitely recommend TLD auto service for all your Toyota/Lexus needs.</text>

Great dude for being a mechanic his pretty damn clean, plus his affordable, knowledgeable,  and honest. I own a Toyota Corolla and a Tacoma glad I met Dan through a ride I gave him through Lyft I really do recommend  him for your Toyota vehicles and I wont be taking my cars else where, he uses nothing but Toyota parts. While others were guessing he knew right away what the problem was I was having on my Tacoma. So yea check him out his very explanatory about what work he does to your vehicles very trust worthy.< /Text>

<review>I was referred to Dan by a co-worker, I took my Toyota Camry to him so he can tell me why it shakes when I brake , and after a hour or so he had found the problem. He told me that it was my rotors. So he recently resurfaced them for me and the car runs great now. Dan has real reasonable prices and great customer service . Dan even recommended me what kind of tires to buy. Dan is  full of knowledge and takes a lot of pride in the work he does. He is a great mechanic but a even  better person. I'm definitely coming back to his shop to get service on my Toyota.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1552801611855, 'text': 'Thank you Jose for your business and your time to leave a great review! Your Camry is very new with only 35,000 miles and brake rotors vibrations are usually caused by over torqued wheel lug nuts during tires rotation. I felt bad that it happened to your vehicle and it’s an annoying problem that has to be fixed ASAP for your safety. Front rotors measured at .004 of an inch run out and the rear had .003 of an inch warpage. The max specifications for any brake rotors are .001, or lower to give you the maximum braking force, performance and a smooth driving experience on the new vehicle’s braking system. Factory service has always delivered best result for your Toyota to the fullest! And thank you Jose for the recommendations!'}<//response><gmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dan was extremely helpful and knowledgeable on what needed to be done for my cars maintenance. He was very honest and did not try to up charge me or sell me on unnecessary maintenance fixes. Very quick service and he even sent me pictures of all the before and after from the work he completed!

Definitely will continue to go there and recommend to anyone needing maintenance done on their vehicle!< /Text>

I brought in my Tacoma pick up that I thought ran ok. Well after Dan worked on it, I realized my truck really did need help. I'm so happy with the work Dan did on my truck and look forward to future visits.</Review>

Brought in my 2003 Lexus ES 300 for a tune up and oil leak, Dan quickly diagnosed the problem and did a detailed analysis of my vehicle, very thorough and he sent me pictures and updates along the way. He seems very intelligent and extremely knowledgeable about my car and you can tell he enjoys his craft, appreciate his honesty and friendly demeanor. Will definitely be bringing my car back to him to get serviced, genuinely nice guy and great mechanic!<//Review>

<review>Dan goes above and beyond for his customers. He exemplifies going the extra mile for anyone.  He is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and thorough with his work. If you have a Toyota or Lexus, do yourself a favor and start taking your car to TLD Auto Service. Dan truly cares about your car and you as a customer.  I loved that he was in constant contact with me, sending me before and after photos. Take your vehicle to him, you will not regret it!< /review>< Rate>

<Text>I own a 2001 Toyota Camry it has over 190,000 miles on it.  I was referred to Dan's shop by several individuals.  This is the first time that I have been satisfied with work that was done on my car.  The car is running smoother and better than it has in years.  Dan is very knowledgeable on Toyota's and explained every service that needed to be done.  Dan goes above and beyond when servicing your vehicle.  He takes a personal interest in your vehicle like it is his.   Dan will even do a follow up with you to make sure that you are satisfied with your service and that your vehicle is up to your standards.  I would highly recommend any Toyota owner to take their car to Dan.<//Text>< Name>

<text>I have always been skeptical with what I read from on line reviews specially when the contents are mostly positive. However, after my husband and I witnessed sincere honesty and compassion from Dan at TLD Auto Service in Visalia, I feel compelled to share the experience we have had with him this week and to somehow validate the truth in the 46 Google reviews we had read.
My husband and I recently had an unfortunate incident with our Lexus 2010 HS 250h while we were out of town driving.  It was a horrifying experience but we are very grateful to GOD we came out of it safe.
Because the car was not drivable and there is no Lexus Dealership in the area my husband Google searched for a reputable auto repair shop. He came across TLD Auto Service that specialize in Toyota and Lexus cars and was convinced by the 5 star reviews that he read.
After doing his diagnostics, Dan took his time to explain in detail while at the same time showing my husband & I,  my sister and brother in law, what had caused the car to break down. I was totally terrified of what could have happened not just to my husband and I but maybe to others as well.  However, his relaxed demeanor, his impressive knowledge and expertise were very comforting.
Unfortunately, he advised us that repair related to recall could only be done through Lexus dealership. He documented his findings, took pictures and for the third time our car was towed to Lexus Bakersfield dealership, which is closer to home. The transfer made me very anxious but he reassured us that in that dealership – “they are good people”.
To us who know nothing about cars, someone honest who cares about doing the right thing is what we always hope and pray for. Dan is truly a blessing!<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1539393453190, 'text': "Thank you Lourdes and husband for your visit and your business! It was very unfortunate for your vehicle to break down (it was not your fault) on your trip up here and I'm very sorry that it happened. I'm glad nobody got hurt and everyone is safe when the incident happened. There is no perfect vehicles out there for purchasing, but with Toyota and Lexus vehicles, I surely, will help to delivery the highest level of service to give you a great ownership's experience. Thanks again for everything and best of luck!"}<//response><gmapID>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Took my 2009 Scion which needed a complete service over to TLD Auto Repair, and Dan performed a thorough inspection and recommended what work needed to be done and the parts that needed to be replaced. He did a really great job and my car is running like new. The replacement parts Dan used were Toyota genuine parts also. I highly recommend TLD Auto Repair for your next service cause Dan's expertise and exceptional service was beyond my expectations. Thanks again!</text>

<Text>Thanks Dan for working on our Sienna van! We used this van for so many trips it had over 200,000 on it. Dan went through it and flushed out everything and did an amazing job! Changed water pump, belts , coolants, spark plugs, gaskets too! He really put's in perfection when it comes to his work. He uses only the best Toyota OEM parts, not aftermarket stuff. He's very honest and can be very trusted.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>Glad I found Dan! I was so impressed with his expertise and professionalism after servicing our ‘07 Sequoia, I brought my ‘01 Sequoia in for an oil change and a last minute once over before a road trip. First, he stayed late because he wanted to make sure it was ok to go, then when he found the radiator had a small crack and was slowly leaking, he sent me photos and was able to order the new radiator and thermostat and completed the repair the next day in time for our trip! Not only that, he somehow found the time to recharge our weak a/c, clean the very dirty throttle body, add fuel system cleaner, lubricate u-joints and a number of items that had been neglected over the years, and test and replace the battery that was at end of life. The fluid I had noticed a few days before wasn’t just from the a/c condensation - very thankful Dan cared enough to extend his day and be so thorough with his inspection and repairs. His keen attention to detail and genuine care for his customer prevented a disaster and we were able to enjoy our trip in a vehicle that felt new again.<//text>< Resp>

I highly recommend Dan @ TLD Auto Service for  all your Toyota and Lexus vehicles.
I work for a government agency and had been looking for a Toyota repair shop that would be able to repair our hybrid vehicles. A friend gave me a business card to TLD Auto Service. I had the opportunity to visit his shop, introduce myself and established an account to repair our fleet. Only a certified mechanic should be removing & installing these particular hybrid batteries.  He is highly trained, skilled and professional.  I was very impressed with his attention to detail with photos sent with me, feeling that I was looking over his shoulder.  As a mechanic, I am aware of the detail in his work as well as his hourly rate, that is significantly lower than the dealer. He installs genuine OEM parts in all the vehicles.
We hope to be dealing with him for years to come.< /Review>

If you have a Toyota or Lexus I highly reccomend TLD for service. Dan is very knowledgeable and honest. He provided me with text before and after pictures and comments for each issue he fixed. Also provided me with a list of what I should fix now and what ca. Wait for later. When I picked my car up he took time to answer all of my questions and pointed out what he did. Prices are more than fair and he does not skimp on parts. Toyota original.  Don't pass him up, you will not regret it.</text>

Toyota and Lexus are great vehicles to own because #1 - they hold their resale value and #2 - they do last a long time if it was properly serviced from the start. Anytime a vehicle is properly serviced, then the word REPAIR will NOT be around as much as not maintained. A well serviced vehicle always and always save you money in the long run and higher fuel economy is the best part overall because it saves you even more money on a weekly basis. Yes, services cost money, but REPAIRS cost 4-5 times more so services are by far a cheaper approach. Thanks again Rebecca for your time to come in and enjoy your Toyota's new performance!"}<//resp>

Thanks for taking care of my toyota! I took in my Camry and Dan found a leak in my radiator which could of been a disaster? I’m glad he’s the kind of mechanic who checks every detail and really cares about helping people! He puts his care into my cars as they were his own. He only uses OEM Toyota parts and not after market parts. He’s very honest and he will take care of your car so you will enjoy it. Thanks Dan for your hard work and true dedication.< /text>

As previous employee of the 5 star Ritz Carlton hotel SF im familiar with high standards.
I cannot express my appreciation to the detail to every single repair and going beyond my expectation of satisfaction.
Not only was I approached with friendly gestures my Toyota Yaris no longer make shrinking noises when I start my engine...
It runs smoother.
My engine as well as my car was washed and cleaned. I'm sold on TLD !
Thank you Dan Nguyen</Review>

I gave TLD a shot at the dreaded engine check indicator WHY is that on??? I'm so impressed with the wholesome rare experience of meeting a mechanic with a obvious passion for Toyota and his job . That I'm putting TLD on top of list for further maintenance/repair when needed. I speak from 24 years of OTR trucking . Believe me a good honest mechanic is priceless...!!!</review>

I will be back many times over and I definitely trust you over the dealership with all your years of experience.  Hands down best place to take your Lexus, Toyota and this man knows his stuff on the hybrids too.  Price was almost half of what i wasted at the dealership with better quality service and work too.

<Text>This is THE place to take your Toyota, for quality OEM parts and reasonable pricing.. I bought a high mileage Scion XB and brought it to Dan the day after purchase. Unfortunately the previous owner hadn’t done much maintenance and needed some work done, but Dan was so awesome that he pointed out what needed immediate attention and even cleaned my engine bay!

Also, if you hate that condescending feeling that some mechanics tend to bestow on their paying customers, you won’t find that here. Dan very kindly explained what was needed, with visuals. Will definitely be bringing my wife’s Corolla here. Thank you, Dan!</Text><Date>1575918571451< /Date>< resp>

Unparalleled service! I have never been so informed by any mechanic. He has a love for Toyota’s and a passion for the mechanics and maintenance of your vehicle.
I was updated with a visual record of the repairs and parts that went into getting my truck running in tip top shape.

Simply the best!</Text>

Definitely the best service I’ve ever had at an auto shop. Dan was very honest and gave me a lot of insight into checking the maintenance of my car. He sent pictures throughout the process of servicing my car so that I could see the difference in the before and after. He is very reasonably priced and does fast, efficient work. He fixed my car within a day despite the amount of work it needed. We will definitely be coming back!<//Text>

I went in to see Dan about a alternator problem on a Lexus. He correctly diagnosed the problem and explained exactly what needed to be done. He even went above and beyond and put in oil and refrigerant in my noisy AC and now it is quiet and puts out super cold air. Dan is incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and very affordable. If you have a Toyota or Lexus that needs to be serviced I would highly recommend you go see Dan, you will be glad did.</Text>

< Review>
Have you ever considered making a mechanic a part of your family? I have been dealing with Dan the past several weeks and have been treated with great respect and appreciation. I brought my friends in for Dan to fix their 2002 Toyota pick up, and he was gracious and kind and generous in his estimate to repair what was wrong.  He performed tasks above and beyond what he quoted and did not even charge for them. He even repaired something a previous mechanic did incorrectly and, again, did not charge for it. My friends were thrilled with his work, his work ethic, and his very reasonable pricing. I will be bringing my Lexis to him
next week and I know I can look forward to the same  excellent service. This is unlike any auto repair shop I have ever had dealings with and I am incredibly surprised and pleased.  Dan  is raising the bar on integrity in a field of business that has traditionally had a lousy reputation. You would be lame not to give him a chance to work on your Toyota or your Lexus.

11/29/18 My second trip to Dan's place was  a great experience. I left my car in his capable hands, and while working on it, he texted me photos of a few items he had discovered that we did not talk about.  These were things done by other mechanics and they were done wrong. I asked him to correct them and he moved on to showing me photos of before and after (before he was finished and I picked up my Lexus). Dan is refreshingly honest and genuinely cares about his clientele. I know I have a mechanic for life. With Dan as my mechanic, my car will probably outlast me!< /Review>

You will never lose money when doing the services, you'd only lose when a component prematurely failed from poor service. Now, you have to spend more money to repair it, thus not saving you any money! Thanks again for everything!"}< /Response><user_name>Mary Collins< /user_name>< Rating>

Dan helped me out today and provided me with a Lexus key fob battery. I’m from Fresno, happened to be in Visalia when the battery ran low. I’m so grateful for Dan and his honest business practice! I definitely will come to him for my repairs instead of Fresno Lexus. ❤️👍🏼❤️<//Review>

We recently took our Lexus with 160+ thousand mileages for service to Dan at TLD.  As promised, the car is running fast and smooth again like new. We are very satisfied - - Not only that the price is reasonable and the service is excellent but most importantly we have the piece of mind that we are not being ripped off. There is no price tag for that!
Highly recommended!!!< /text>

Dan, simply put, is the BEST at what he does. As if his service wasn't enough, his fees and pricing are more than amazing! I truly couldn't appreciate Dan more and all that he has done for me to keep my truck in tip top shape!!

<Text>Finally... somebody that knows how to care for my Sequoia, and I can't wait to get my 4Runner into Dan and set him loose on it.  Dan is very refreshing and extremely passionate about Toyota and Lexus.  In the past, I've taken my vehicles to the Dealer or other reputable mechanics.  I'd spend gawd-awful $$ for maintenance and repairs with little change in how they performed.   I can honestly say that when I drove my Sequoia home from Dan's shop, I thought I was driving a completely different vehicle.  Wow... I was seriously impressed!  Dan texted me pics of every maintenance deficiency he found while thoroughly inspecting my Sequoia and took care of the issues at a reasonable cost, and he ONLY uses Toyota OEM parts.  Dan knows his stuff and will be the only mechanic working on my Toyota's in the future.<//Text>< pics>

He adjust a few things to his standards and also found a few things I didn't notice that need to be fixed. He gave me so much information on how to properly use and maintain my vehicle. I have never had a mechanic give explanations of why and how things work on a vehicle the way he does. With all the information Dan gave me this car might out last me! Once you meet Dan and have him work on your car you won't want to go anywhere else.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This will be the only mechanic I take my Prius to from now on.  Dan provided great service at a very fair price.  He got our Prius running and I will definitely take it back for regular maintenance from now on.  Thanks Dan!</Text>

Unparalleled craftsmanship, complete focus on customer experience and amazing savings!

I was happy to find a shop in Visalia that specializes in servicing Lexus, and looked forward to avoiding the hassle of a day trip to Fresno to get quality work done on my Lexus. What I experienced was so much more than convenience. Dan took time to understand what I wanted to have done and went to great lengths to provide options that would fit my budget. His attention to detail and expert knowledge lead me to chose to have a considerable amount of work done. I’m really glad I made the investment and feel confident my Lexus is in optimum condition to last many, many more miles! My car runs and looks amazingly like new too- thanks to Dan’s fine work! Best of all, the investment I made was significantly less than I would’ve paid at the dealer!

Dan made a point to provide great detail (and photos) of all the work he did. That was quite an education, and I’m really glad I took Dan’s advice to proceed with some of the maintenance I had been putting off.

My Lexus and I have found a new friend in Dan and TLD Auto Service. I am happy to offer my testimony of complete satisfaction and my wholehearted recommendation.<//Text>

The reality is that NO two independent shops are the same, or can provide the same level of service and repairs. Believe it or not, the Auto industry is a very complicated business and 90% of the consumers don't know it because each manufacturers have their own inventions. A Lexus will only drive like a Lexus and perform like one if and only if it was properly serviced from the beginning. Once metal parts are worn down excessively from poor servicing, then it will never give its performance like before, ever again! I drove your Lexus before and after service to make sure the performance difference is now back like when it was before when you drove it out of the Dealership. Thanks again for your business Bill and see you next time!"}< /resp>

<text>Great thorough & extremely fair priced service, by TLD Auto Service. I met with Dan the owner prior to dropping of our 2004 Avalon for a routine upper & lower radiator hose, thermostat replacement & radiator flush. It was easy to see Dan is an extremely honest business man and a fine master technician. During the service he provided text photos clearly showing other maintenance issues recommended. Including side by side photo comparison of the current part to a new OEM replacement part. One service visit will convince you, Dan is the one you want servicing your Toyota!< /text>< pics>

TLD Auto Service takes pride in there work and do it the right way.  While visiting from San Diego, I had an alternator problem on a Friday afternoon.  I needed to drive back in San Diego on Sunday.  Emailed LTD and they got right back to me and made arrangements to take care of my alternator the next morning, Saturday.  Dan, at TLD, went above and beyond by not only expertly fixing the alternator, but by also thoroughly inspecting and fixing several other issues.  Additionally, Dan cleaned the throttle body, steam cleaned the engine, and washed the car at no additional charge.   I wish he were located in San Diego.  I highly recommend TLD for your Toyota Lexus repairs and service.</review>

<Text>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  I would like to Thanks Dan for providing best customer service.  I brought my car in for a strange noise.  Dan inspected my car and said nothing was wrong with it except for a loose nuts on the heat shield of the catalytic converter.  He tightened up all the nuts and inspected my entire vehicle.  Upon inspection, Dan discovered there was a leak surrounding the oil pan and my rear brake was worn out.  I made an appointment with Dan to have the oil pan gasket and brakes replaced.  Dan replaced all the parts with genuine OEM parts.  I am very happy with the service and will bring all my cars here to service from now on.
Dan, a very honest and highly skill Certified Master Technician.  He takes time to explain what is wrong with your car and ONLY recommend necessary services.  By the way, I have never encountered any repair shops that are so clean and organized.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I met Dan owner of TLD a few years ago in San Jose Ca to work on my IS 350 , after years of getting ripped off by the dealerships. Dan not only fixed the new things i needed maintenance on he fixed things the dealership did wrong !! Honest, caring and very knowledgeable, i won't let anyone else touch my car, he really is Dan The Man !! I just drove 200 miles for him to replace my waterpump and a few other things and my car has never run better !!! If you care about your Toyota/Lexus there is no one better. He is a Master Lexus Technician  and knows them inside and out .. Won't push parts on you that don't need fixing , sends pictures of new/ old parts you never have to wonder if thing's were really done and great to know they were done right. He is the best !!!

Let me Start by Saying DAN IS THE BEST!!!!!
3 Years Ago,  the engine seized on my 1999 Lexus RX300,   I purchased a used Japanese Engine with the 50K or less miles.  I paid a DIFFERENT MECHANIC(NOT DAN) to install the engine.

For 3 years, that mechanic attempted to get the Check Engine Light to stay off longer than 50 Miles.  He kept changing part after part in the the vehicle only to get NEW ERROR CODES.  This mechanic was paid close to $3K (I bought the engine for $1K and had it sent to the mechanics shop) and here comes October 2109 and a SMOG is due and still the Check Engine Light.

Many times I though to just salvage the car, and cut my losses.  The RX300 is in great shape and I take good care of it.  I took it to 2 Other Mechanics and for $500 EACH ($1K), I was told they COULD NOT FIX the Issue.

I found DAN with an internet search and decided to give it one Last Try!  When I took the RX300 into Dan, I told him I really didn't have anymore money to spend on the vehicle UNLESS he could get it to the point of Passing the Smog.  Dan told me, that he would NOT CHARGE ME UNLESS HE COULD GET IT TO PASS SMOG!!!!!    WHAT!!!!!   WHAT!!!!

AN HONEST MECHANIC!!!!

Dan had the vehicle for 2 weeks, and did Numerous Corrections to the Initial Replacement of the Japanese 50K Engine.  Wrong Gaskets, Old Worn Gaskets, Broken Bolts, Stripped Bolts, Non-OEM Parts, and Incorrect Parts were ALL used by the First Mechanic.

Dan updated me almost daily with Text, Calls, and Photos of what was wrong and how he corrected it.  At the end of the 2 weeks, Dan had the vehicle carbon output equal to a Brand New Car.

The Car Passed Smog with Flying Colors!!!

Dan is the Best and will be the ONLY Mechanic to touch my Lexus and 3 Toyotas!!!

Thanks, Dan!!!<//Review>

I must say Dan is one heck of a mechanic. He knows his stuff and it shows in his work. I went to him with my is300 to get the clutch replaced. Along the way we bumped into some problems with the car, but he sure did help clear all that up. Sends pictures of the damaged parts and sends a follow up with the new parts installed. Really helps you have piece of mind when you get work done by him. I can’t say the same about dealers since they don’t go the extra mile like Dan himself. My car feels better than ever. Thank you Dan and to anyone wondering if they should give him a shot I say go for it 100%. You won’t regret it.<//review>

It was sad to find out that your Lexus was badly neglected from the previous ownership and was also tampered by his mechanics. Engine oils leaked everywhere and the clutch was replaced once, but the clutch disc was installed backwards; therefore, your clutch assemblies were not engaging and disengaging properly like a performance clutch system. Now, we both know that every bolts, nuts, and screws are properly torqued down to specifications and yes, it is fixed back to the Factory's settings to delivery the performance for your needs. Thanks again for your visit and business!"}< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>This is the best shop to bring your Toyota. I brought my FJ CRUISER in and They repaired it and had me back on the road in no time. Gotta say they did more than expected. These guys are reliable and honest. They do dealerships fixes without the over priced prices the dealership screws you with at the end. I'm from Las Vegas and broke down in Visalia on my way to the Bay Area... Thank you for getting me back on the road. Much thanks...

Just bought a leased Lexus and immediately brought it to Dan for examination and service. Dan thoroughly examined the car inside and out and reported minor servicing that the dealership omitted. Using only Lexus parts and with his keen skills, Dan had my car running like new.  Dan is meticulous, extremely hardworking, and refreshingly honest.  I will continue to bring my Lexus to Dan for the life of the car.<//text>

Dan did not disappoint, he went above and beyond in his service and made sure all repairs were done correctly. You can definitely tell he truely cares about his customers and making sure the job is done right! Thanks again for your excellent service, integrity, knowledge and honesty.

I would highly recommend Dan to anyone who owns a Toyota or Lexus. I keep up with the matinence on my 2012 Lexus is250. Dan has really helped me get my Lexus to drive and perform like new. He is the most honest mechanic you will ever meet.  He will take pictures of you vehicle and what he is working on. His prices are reasonable and he takes great pride in his work. I truly am thankful to have such great service here at TLD Auto. His service truly is outstanding and keeps me doing my business here locally in Visalia. I have referred Dan to several of my friends and parents. They too are very please with the amazing service.  Thank you Dan!<//text>

This is my 2nd review of Dan, we took our 2012 Prius to him for a vehicle inspection after my wife and I bought our first car.

We ended up getting in a car crash and buying a newer plug in with less miles, the first thing we did is take it to Dan for another inspection and to establish a maintenance schedule. He recommended we do an oil change and an EFI fuel intake carbonize service which we did. He always sends us before and after pictures to show what the filters looked like when replaced, which is quite nice as it shows a level of honesty you don't normally see.

We trust Dan in full and look forward to the many years driving our little car.< /Text>

To all LEXUS and Toyota owners I took our LEXUS to TLD in Visalia, California for the first time and what a difference. If you live in Bakersfield, Wasco, McFarland, DELANO and the surroundings are please take my advice and take your vehicles to TLD and see and talk to owner Dan Nguyen. Mr Nguyen is very honest and knowledgeable on Lexus, and Toyota vehicle’s. Take Mr. Nguyen you’re vehicle’s he will do the correct and excellent work on your vehicle’s. As he did on our Lexus 2017, Rc350.

I stumbled upon Dan's TLD Auto Service by chance, and boy am I happy I did.  I took my 2014 FJ Cruiser there for a transmission service as a kind of test.  He passed with flying colors!  I had become disenchanted with the local dealership and was looking for a good indy shop to trust my truck to.  Dan is professional, knowledgeable, and very thorough.  He gave me future recommendations and did not try to upsell me.  His prices are lower than the dealership and very fair.  He uses Toyota fluids, oil, and filters so you know you are getting the best for your vehicle.
I feel confident recommending Dan 100% to everyone-especially those who really care about their car.<//Text>

I was referred to Dan by a  friend who always mentioned how great, knowledgeable and honest he was. I have a 2014 Lexus that I’ve serviced at Fresno Lexus since purchasing. My car was sounding off and I decided to come to Dan and have him take a look at my concerns. Dan is very knowledgeable and explained what he would do. I Picked up my car from Dan today and it sounded so much different and better like new like when I drove it off the lot the first time. It didn’t sound or drive this way after my last Fresno Lexus visit for service. My car was returned washed and vaccum. And can I mention he even cleaned under the hood. I can’t beleive Fresno Lexus doesn’t do that! It was filthy. Dan is a full service shop without that high ticket price and I will return here and recommend him to any Toyota and Lexus owners.<//review>

I actually found Dan online looking for another shop and I am sure glad I went with Dan instead! If I could give Dan more stars I would! This is the first time going to TLD and I will certainly be back. Dan took excellent care of our 4runner. I have never owned a new vehicle but after the 170k service that Dan provide the 4runner certainly looks and feels like new. After I left the shop I felt the difference in acceleration and I already had more MPG on my way home. At the stop light I couldn't even tell the car was on, it felt like I was in a hybrid, it idled so well. The throttle bottle cleaning and EFI cleaning really make a difference. You can see and feel the difference. It’s like night and day. He also details the vehicle, which my wife said she had never seen our rims so shiny. Dan backs up his work with photos of the work he is completing so you know exactly how everything looks and it allows you to compare before and after pictures. Dan was able to explain everything very thoroughly and gave us a lot of driving and maintenance tips to keep our vehicles running in top shape. Dan was very affordable for our 170k service especially considering all of the work that it needed done. He was able to catch a few things wrong with previous maintenance, such as loose plugs and a need for a new drain plug and re-thread of the drain hole in the drain pan.

If you take your car to the dealer, do yourself and your car a favor by going to Dan instead. I saved at least 50% from what the dealer would have charged me for all of the work Dan did on our 4runner. If you own a Toyota or Lexus you should definitely see Dan for excellent quality service at a good price. He only uses OEM Toyota parts and all work is done better than you would receive at the dealer. Dan is honest, transparent, quick to respond and does everything himself. He knows exactly what he is doing and certainly is a master Toyota mechanic. Dan is very professional and he e really cares about your vehicle and the well being of you and your family and your vehicle. I highly recommend you see Dan. You will be 100% satisfied. He also provides you with detailing and he even set me up with an Uber right home, out of town! His shop is also super clean and organized.

Thank you once again Dan for your excellent work! May your business continue to grow and prosper.</Text>

Amazing Service!  I took my 2006 Rav4 in for an oil change and 110 mile service.  Dan, the owner and mechanic, is a true professional.  During the day he took pictures to show me the places where work was needed.  When I returned to pick up the car, it was washed and in mint condition.  On the way home, it felt as if I were driving a new car.  It had been running rough which I thought was just part of owning an older car.  Now I've decided to keep the Rav for a few more years.  Thank you Dan.</Text>

You have kept your Rav4 to be in the 10/10 mint condition and shape, except for the engine was running a little rougher than normal and receiving low mpg's for the mileage that you have. I can help to apply the proper services to your Rav4 to make it run like new again, and importantly, increase your mpg's to be as high as the new Rav4. Anytime a Toyota, or Lexus vehicle has been properly serviced, you will then notice the increase in your mpg's and its new performance like a new vehicle.

<Review>Dan, the shop owner, has been my mechanic since before he had a shop up in San Jose, CA.  My 2005 Camry is approaching 200K miles, yet runs reliably thanks to Dan's competence as a mechanic.  Over the years, my Camry's required some repairs (e.g. replaced the front catalytic converter & water pump) and general maintenance (e.g. oil change, fluids, new filters.)  Dan's done a great job and I'm greatly satisfied with the service he's provided. Plus, I've never felt ripped off or taken advantage by Dan, especially since Dan gives thorough answers and suggestions in replying to my questions--all without pressuring me to complete a sale. My car runs great. I'm sticking with Dan as my mechanic.

<user>100755277691524370165</user><Review>Dan knows all my Lexus vehicles inside out and backwards.  He is meticulous about using factor parts and fluids.  That has kept my vehicles working without a problem.  When I had one of the ignition coils fail (my unit has two) he tracked down the problem in my driveway to be sure I could get on the road again.  The average mechanic would never go to that much trouble to be sure a customer could keep running.  He is the kind of guy you keep coming back to year after year.< /Review>< username>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>My car had a failing alternator and I Google searched for a mechanic who specializes in Lexus in the Visalia area and found Dan of TLD Auto Services.  Over the phone, Dan was very transparent and I immediately booked an appointment to have him diagnose my vehicle.  He was quick to narrow-down the issue and had the work done immediately.  He had via text pictures of the old and new parts and updated me with the progress.  He is honest and gave me recommendations for future upkeep which I really appreciate.  The service I had received was 100X better than the dealership.  He is very knowledgeable and solutions orientated not to mention an amazing down-to-earth disposition!  I will be going to Dan for all my vehicle maintenance from now on. I highly recommend him.  - Dr. Vang

Update 05/15/19.  I've returned to TLD for my vehicle's maintenance and every time I leave his shop, I know my vehicle is well taken care for and serviced well.  I appreciate that he uses OEM parts.  I have never been to a better mechanic who is upfront and honest.  I wish I could give Dan of TLD Auto Service 10 Stars!< /Text><Time>1557952581991<//Time>< Rating>

Dan is great knows in detail how to repair Lexus and toyotas will only reccomend the best factory parts for your vehicle.

I’ve known Dan for a few months now as an acquaintance.  However,  being in the car business myself, right here in Visalia for the last 45 years,  I know a lot of people in this line of business, and Dan is different.  He treats every vehicle that comes into his shop personal, he treats it like it was his own .
I just purchased a Toyota (used),  Dan has checked it out completely for me.  Thanks  Dan, I wouldn’t trust anyone else to do what you specialize in.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I needed a new Toyota mechanic for my 2003 Lexus. Dan definitely made a great impression as he told me how he was going to diagnose all the issues with my vehicle and keep me posted on the progress. I thought I was doing an ok job in keeping my car in shape but as I learned there was a lot more I could have done and Dan assured me that my car would run as if it was new. He sent me pics of all the issues he found due to wear and tear, improper repairs made by other mechanics and overall aging of some parts. Although he would not commit to telling me how much the total repairs would cost, he assured me that OEM parts would be used and he would give me a huge break in labor costs compared to a Lexus dealership. At the end, my car needed some extensive repairs and TLC but he saved me not hundreds, but thousands of dollars in labor costs. He provided me printouts of a Lexus dealership breakdown for parts and labor and his final bill was thousands of dollars less. Dan sent pics of all the OEM parts for the job, showed me the parts he replaced and pics as he torn down the engine. I can't say enough as to mechanical skills Dan has and the professionalism and pride he takes in his work.

Found my technician for my '08 Prius!! Dan's great!! I initially talked to him about light service on my Prius,(ie: change spark plugs; check belts)... turned out that the water pump was leaking, oil was dirty, last shop was using wrong oil filter and drain plug gasket, transmission oil was dirty, both engine and electric motor coolant was old, A/C needed to be charged, etc....even the rear wiper insert was wrong!!  With my authorization, Dan replaced everything that needed replacement with Toyota OE parts. He even cleaned the engine compartment!! Needless to say that I spent more than I originally intended, but my Prius runs like new. Money well spent!! Every Toyota/Lexus owners will benefit from TLD service with Dan.<//Text>

TLD Auto Service is owned and operated by Dan Nguyen, an extremely well trained Lexus and Toyota mechanic.  Dan is a one-of-a-kind mechanic that is truly committed to unparalleled customer service.
He proved himself after working on my 2012 Tundra which had a multitude of small issues that he quickly identified, diagnosed and  repaired within 24 hours.  I was truly impressed by the quality of his work including his efficient methods, strict attention to detail, use of OEM parts and transparency in the repairs he made.  The cost was surprisingly reasonable and VERY competitive.  It is abundantly  obvious that Dan has impeccable integrity and character.  He is honest, forthcoming, hard-working, possess superior knowledge of his craft and is dedicated to serving his customers to the best of his abilities.  I can only hope that Visalia doesn't lose such a great mechanic and person.< /text>

First of all, I thank you for highly recognizing my integrity and the qualities of my detail-oriented work ethic. Toyota and Lexus vehicles don't have a lot of problems if it was properly maintained from the beginning to start with and you have done just that. Your Tundra was built with state of the art engineering and therefore, required a very minimal service to keep it going like new. Whatever the Factory required your Tundra to have service, I can do it all here at TLD Auto for you to help keep it new like the day you drove out of the dealership. The money spent on all the recommended services always paid off in the long run for you. Thanks again Mr. CitrusGrower57 for your business!"}<//response></record>

Hello, was referred to this place by a family friend before taking it here we took it to another place in tulare and they totally scammed us just for money. Dan serviced our toyota 4 runner and we couldn't be happier with all the work he put in, we finally have a mechanic we can TRUST! Thank you Dan for your honesty and hard work! I totally recommend anyone with a toyota or lexus to go to TLD Auto, you won't be disappointed!</Text>

I had an issue with a repair of my own and hit a road block. Sent the vehicle to Dan after he took time away from his own work and came to my shop to give me some advice to help me do it on my own. I tried.. but couldn't.
So again, I sent the vehicle to Dan and he worked on it all night. He did this knowing I had a deadline too. In other words putting my work before his. He too had some issues but didn't give up. As he worked over the weekend he kept me updated and i knew ot was only a matter of time, my probkem would be solved. Well, he called me, and just as excited I was to hear it, he was to tell me... he got it!
This guy knows his stuff and is very passionate in his level of customer service all the way to his final product. Hands down an honest and great mechanic. You'll be pleased you took your Toyota and Lexus to the best guy in town, after your experience with Dan at TLD.
Thanks again Dan. I look forward to a great workimg relationship. You have my business.< /Text>< rate>

Came to Dan because when I met him I could tell he had a genuin passion for Toyotas, I have three myself. After talking to him you see that he’s an honest man. Says what he does and does what he says.  He not only fixes your car but has the heart of a teacher. Ask him anything. He makes time to explain what he’s doing and why he’s doing it. He pays attention to detail and it shows. Uses only genuine toyota parts and fluids straight from Toyota and has all his certifications hanging in the office. Labor rate is much more affordable than the dealer, which is ridiculously expensive. Overall had a great experience.<//review>

I don’t know why you would take your Toyota or Lexus anywhere else. I live in clovis and bring my vehicle to Dan for all my servicing and diagnostics. He is honest, trustworthy, transparent and only uses OEM Toyota/Lexus parts. Dan explains everything to you and sends you before/after pictures of what he services on your vehicle. I plan on getting 400K+ miles out of my 4Runner and Dan is the man that will help me achieve those numbers. He educates you on how to keep your vehicle running in top shape and never sells you anything you don’t need. I won’t take my vehicles to any other mechanic. If you own a toyota/Lexus, do yourself and your vehicle a favor by visiting Dan’s shop. You won’t be disappointed.< /text>

I was referred to Dan from a prius v driver I had met since I have a prius v I thought I would check him out. After talking to Dan I thought ok, he sounds like he knows what he is talking about. I got an oil change and he washed my car. Sweet. I was not expecting that. Today I got my 100 thousand mile service and after today I am convinced I have found my new mechanic. Dan fully explained everything he was going to do and took pictures and sent them to my phone so I could see what he did and I got a car wash again. Dan will only use genuine Toyota parts and he is a certified Toyota mechanic. As far as I am concerned anybody in a 30 mile radius that needs a Toyota mechanic should come to Dan. He is knowledgeable, thourogh, and reasonable. If this is what you are looking for then Dan is your man.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>So I had my 4Runner tow back to TLD because I went to go buy a battery at auto-zone and they gave me the wrong battery and I accidentally cross the wires knowing that since auto-zone employees should know what they are doing but instead gave me a wrong battery and that burnt out most of the car fuse but TLD fixes the issue for me, plus when I got my car back it ran better than I had it. Can not ask for a better service then TLD. I have three cars and I will always take it to TLD if I can’t fix it myself. Been the dealer to fix my celica gts but they couldn’t find out why the lift wasn’t kicking in in high rpm. I kinda know why but the people who work at Toyota should know about Toyota but TLD knew what was wrong with it plus I figure it was the same issue too. The best thing is that we have TLD to fix our cars to make it to point A to B but not just that even beyond that. I just want to say TLD business is going to run forever. Any issue with your yota or Lexus take it there. Problem solve.< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Once a month I travel from Southern California to a beautiful foothill community in Northern California.  I was a little over 2 and 1/2 hours into a 7 hour trip at 6:30 am on a Saturday when the Check Engine warning light and two other warning lights started flashing on my 2001 Lexus with nearly 236,000 miles on it.  I was 10 miles south of Tulare but decided to risk reaching Tulare to pull over for breakfast and to search for a Toyota/Lexus service shop.  The first entry on Google Search was TLD Auto Service, another 20 minutes away, and it was the only service shop that would be open on Saturday.  The nearest Lexus dealership is 50 miles away in Fresno.  I decided to risk the trip to TLD in Visalia knowing that if I broke down I could get AAA to tow me to TLD.  I made it there by 7:45 and put a call into the shop--no answer, but I left a message pleading my predicament.  At just past 8:30 Dan showed up with a smile on his face and his hand extended in greeting.  Dan is simply an absolutely delightful man.  He completely put me at ease while solving my problem and he patiently and thoroughly explained what had gone wrong and how to fix it.  He also performed a thorough check of the entire vehicle and pointed out to me what was right and what was wrong with the prior service that had been performed on the car.  He even convinced me that with proper service my car can easily make 400,000 miles.  I spent nearly 4 hours with Dan while he worked giving my car a thorough tune-up--sharing backgrounds (somehow I reminded him of his biology teacher in high school!?!), talking about family, hearing about his journey from San Jose to Visalia to provide the best life for his family, but most importantly hearing about his mantra for providing the absolute best service for his clients.  He will only use OEM parts, he will only charge a fair price, he will always thoroughly explain (and demonstrate through photographic documentation) what needs to be fixed on the vehicle.  As I will still be making round trips just past Visalia twice a month I will be booking appointments with Dan for him to perform all of the maintenance work on my Lexus.  He is so considerate that he offered to essentially chauffeur me (and my wife) to a nearby restaurant while we wait for the service to be performed.  Dan simply is the best that he can be and, quite honestly, he is the best!  Thank you Dan for saving my butt when I needed it and for being such a nice, warm, thoughtful person.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1544649484390, 'text': "Thank you Glenn for your business and your time to leave a review! I'm glad nothing major happened to your Lexus as you're far away from home and that my services have met up to your standards. Maybe your Lexus wanted you to meet my business for you to know for future reference so it sets the light to come on at the right timing (Just kidding!). We diagnosed and identified the problem and what caused the light to come on for future reference. No cars and parts last forever, but TLD Auto can help to show you how to make it last longer to save you money. Doing a lot of services on a car don't mean it will run right or last longer...what makes it last longer is doing the right services at the right mileage and timing to prolong any vehicles. Once again, thank you Glenn for your business and a pleasure to meet you as well!"}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80952f4d409f5e57:0x97449589ed6f4f44< /gmap_id></record>

Very honest and knowledgable mechanic. I recommended TLD to my father in-law to fix his Toyota Prius. He did a fantastic job on the a/c repair and kept in touch with my father in-law every step of the way. He went above and beyond on the service and is a great example in visalia of how a business should be ran. Definitely bring your Toyota or Lexus here!<//Text>
