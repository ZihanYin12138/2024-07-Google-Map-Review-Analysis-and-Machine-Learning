<Text>I use this library primarily for picking books for my kids. They have great collection for kids and toddlers besides everything else.

<text>Friendly staff and an awesome library! Liked the collection, also the layout. It was quite peaceful to read there, it's relatively small but small is better if you can find what you need in time. Typically it used to take much longer for me to find interesting books than what I had observed here, so maybe it's a good collection or my interests have changed lately.

Library is quite bright, I liked the view of the apricot garden from study desks. There's very few wall outlets so if you're planning to work on laptop, better to either bring it fully charged, come at less popular hours, or close the lid when the battery is dead and spend time reading real books there which isn't bad, maybe a bliss. One of the patron has installed more ports around the sofas which is quite useful in the emergency.

Children's section has nice collection too. One cool thing I noticed was that books for parenting are also found in the children's section. It's great idea as it makes books more accessible to relevant people. I'd have actually missed getting few very useful books had I not found them there. Thanks to whoever thought of this!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>This library is great. The no-appointment line is at the main library and a bit long so I recommend making an appointment. You can pick those up near the soccer field and theater house.< /text><Date>1595028033792<//Date>< user>

Easy to return books both during and after hours. Great selection of new releases and bestsellers; All genres are broken down into sections in the library, including sci-fi/fantasy. Great activities for kids, teens and adults both at and away from the library. Definitely use your library card to check out museum passes!< /text>

I really like this library and have been going there for years. It is an older library, sort of out of the 70s, but it fits in with the little town of Los Altos feel. Many young and many old come here. People study hard here and they have a good online book reserve system online (it's a Santa Clara County library). I've always found it to be a pleasant and welcoming place. Sometimes, there are older men reading papers in different languages who will fall asleep in chairs while reading. I always like that and it demonstrates the comfort and community feel of the place.</review>

< Review>
This review is written from the perspective of a mama of a toddler, so I have only used the children's section. There is a good play area and fun surrounds (daughter loves seeing the fishes), and they have lots of events for kids. I'm docking two stars off for the presence of iPads at toddler-level (with a sign that says they are only for use for kids over 2 and with adult supervision). Even now that my daughter is 2, I don't see the point in going to the library for her to play on a screen, while surrounded by books and other kids to play with! This is a personal view but if you have similar screen-free preferences for little ones, I thought it might help. We've stopped going because the pull of the screen is too much for her/me to handle.</Review>

<Text>This library is friendly, helpful, and has a vast collection.  The staff are helpful and there are many different places to sit.  It's very family friendly.
Even if what you're looking for isn't at this branch, you can order an item from the entire library system.</Text></record>

Decent parking lot but seems like it's often quite full.< /Text>< Pics>

The facilities are fine, but you have to pay an annual fee just to get a library card if you are not a Los Altos resident! A public library that you have to pay to be a member of. Of course, you can just read the books you want inside the library, but still... there must be other ways of filling in this budget gap, if this is indeed a result of budget issues...</Text>

<Text>Unless Los Altos resident, computer use costs $4 for two hours same-day (expires end of day), and you can't check out materials; or you can buy $80-a-year library membership. I've never heard more loud people in a library: adults, staff, children. What happened to quiet in a library to let people read and study in peace? Yikes. Wifi is free, fairly speedy and reliable.<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>Having not been in a public library in ~15yrs, I walked in here with a simple question about the books I had and needed.  Since all my memories of public libraries prior to this are fond and full of smiling and overly helpful librarians, it was a shock to be met with scowls, annoyance, and overall rudeness.  There was also some passive aggressive commentary made by some random library patron who did not have anything to do with the situation but felt the need to interject without actually engaging.  My questions and myself were clearly unwelcome in this place.  0/10, would not recommend.</Text></record></dataset><record>

There was also dust and crumbs all over the place. When I go and find him and told him if he could wipe it off and he said why?  and I said well why am I paying you guys if the stains are  still there. He gets a dry cloth and wiped, which made no difference.Then he turns around and looks at me as if what else do you want me to do and I just looked at him and said forget it. I got in my car and left.  never again will I ever waste $20 at that place. Too lazy and rude.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've been here several times, out of those maybe once did I end up with a clean car. I have a truck and they won't vacuum the trunk unless I ask and even then it's no guarantee. I always find myself having to clean the car again when I get home because they don't do a good job. They use the baby powder scent, no matter what I ask for, which makes the car smell like baby diapers, it's not pleasant. I'm tired of spending almost $30 to have only the exterior of the car semicleaned.< /Review>

They don't even know that it's not a product to use when cleaning the steering wheel because it gets slippery .. The staff never says hi or bye. Price is high compared to quality of service.</review><GmapID>0x80c2c77b3f692a3b:0xbb1d9534dc1ca2c0</GmapID>< Rate>

STOLEN THINGS FROM CAR! I came in for a detail, paid 80 and they did a nice job. Unfortunately, one of my car mats was stolen during the detail and nobody could find it. I spoke with a man and a woman at the car wash about the missing item and they refused to compensate or make any arrangements to reimburse me for the stolen item. It was a real drag.<//Text>

If you just want a wash, then this is ok.  But if yiu want a decent (not even quality) wash, then go elsewhere.  I've been coming here for awhile and I never get a consistent wash.  Dirt spots or tree resin are still there.  I have to point it out, which makes the experience more managerial rather than pleasant.  I say drive a little and go elsewhere.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The guys cleaning my car STOLE money out of it ( Just change, But: 1, Its the principle and 2, I should be able to take my car to a place and not have to worry that while I'm looking straight at them, they're stealing from me. I had quarters in my car for laundry. Gone. Now I have to stop and get more..) The guy telling me prices, "made me a deal" but when I went to pay, The management didnt recognize the "deal" and charged me full.
Besides being shady, they dont even clean well. Interior was still dirty, exterior had stuff on it that I went and scraped with my finger. I was displeased and told the first guy who gave me "the deal" and he said that "if I Didn't like it, I could have a refund". Again, shady management refused a refund, and then questioned why I would leave anything in my car (acknowledging that his staff steals) when told about my change.
BAD SERVICE. SHADY OWNER. NOT GOOD AT CLEANING. AVOID AT ALL COSTS<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I brought my car here on Thursday (3/16/17) and I was very upset at the way a situation was handled by the manager. Part of my car antenna broke off while it passed through the new automatic washers that they have installed. I told the manager about it and all he said was that HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE for anything that happens to a car while it is being washed. What a bunch of bs. Don't spend your money here. Go to another car wash that values their customers and takes responsibility for their wrongdoings because this place doesn't. I will never come back here again.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I very disappointed with the customer service at this car wash. I left personal belongings in my car and 3 dollars in my glove compartment. I know my money was in there because I checked before left my car. When the car was returned to me, the money was gone. I spoke with the manager, and he ignored me and told me that it’s my fault, because I should of never left any money in the car. Never will I use their service again.</Review>

<Text>Today I got a basic wash and was satisfied for my $7. When I got home I went to polish my rims and noticed the chrome cap to my roofrail was missing. I went back and spoke with a manager. He immediately set off to find it. Brought it to me, wiped it off and apologized. I am very impressed by his professionalism. I definitely recommend this car wash!</Text><name>Tony Bruno<//name><GmapID>0x80c2c77b3f692a3b:0xbb1d9534dc1ca2c0< /GmapID>< rating>

Horrible. Just horrible. I took a chance and got the deluxe car wash with polish and not only did they do a horrible job cleaning my car they even went so far to polish over dirt that was still on my car. the inside was no more deluxe if I had done it myself. After all of that I sat waiting another 20 minutes looking at my car expecting them to continue cleaning or at least let me know they're done. which they didn't.</review>

Cleaning service is soso. Problem is emplyees stole money from my car and my my wife's car and this isn't first time. And also  they broke lid part of  coin component and hide it. I fixed it by myself but this is so terrible service and attitudes. Just don't go to this place.</review>

The car wash was mediocre. Their workers searched my entire car and stole money from a place they had no reason to go into. Even though the car wash never takes responsibility they should take responsibility for their customer service. This is bad customer service.</Review>

I had car wash and wax. They did not clean the body completely and even the wax job missed several spots. Also, they stained my new driver seat with oil or wax.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) (Painted) I used a coupon to get a $ 18 wash, about $ 8, but when I tried to pay by card, I refused to be less than $ 10. However, in the process, the lady at the counter was a little teased by her face and speech. Refusing to pay for a card less than $ 10 seems to be illegal, but in fact, I wonder if it would be true to refuse it if I could accept that it was 18 dollars. Moreover, the meaning of using a coupon often means that it is a regular ... I feel a little offended. (Of course, I haven't been friendly before, but it seems to be more unkind today because I was denied payment. I told you to withdraw money because there is an ATM machine. ...)

(도장)쿠폰을 써서 18불 워시를 8불쯤 나왔는데, 카드로 결재할려고 하자 10불 미만은 안된다고 거부했습니다. 허나 그 과정에서 카운터에있는 아줌마가 좀 놀리는듯한 얼굴과 언행으로 기분이 좀 상했네요. 10불 미만 카드 결제 거부는 불법이 아닌듯한데 사실 내가 구입한것은 18불 짜리였다라는 걸 가만한다면 과연 무조건 거부하는게 맞는건지 궁금하네요. 더우기 쿠폰을 쓰고 있다라는 뜻은 자주 단골이라는 뜻이라는건데... 좀 기분이 상했습니다. (물론 이전에도 응대가 친절한적은 없었으나 결재거부를 당해서 그런지 오늘은 더욱더 불친절한것 같네요. ATM 기계 있으니 돈을 뽑으라고 했는데 본인 수수료는 아깝고 손님수수료는 별로 안 아까운것 같네요. 장사하는데는 서비스라는 것도 있을텐데...)< /review><user_name>Jay Jung<//user_name><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I’ve tried many different gyms results is by far the best gym I’ve been to. The coach’s know everyone by name and make you feel like you are important. I love the group setting, it motivates me to work harder. I love my results family, it’s the best part of my day.<//Review>

I absolutely love Results Transformation Center. I started out doing a Six Week Challenge and was hooked. I’ve been a member for five years now and look forward to my gym time. The coaches and staff are very supportive and encouraging. They have created an environment that makes everyone feel comfortable no matter your fitness level or age. They can modify any move until you get stronger. As I face reality that I’m not a spring chicken anymore, I know that I need to exercise regularly to physically feel better. My inflammation has completely disappeared since I’ve began Results. It’s the best decision I made and I totally recommend this gym to anyone.</text>

<text>I would totally recommend Result transformation it's not your average gym .The environment is friendly, as an your not just buddy someone you know but new faces are always cheered and welcomed every class .Coaches always on move during class helping correcting form and pushing. Care Coaches help with any questions related nutrition and stretching. I recommend you'll to give a try drop in for class .< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1612814350375, 'text': 'Hi Judith, thank you for your positive review!

I just completed my first 6 week challenge and lost over 16lbs, when I did not think that was possible! The coaching staff is great, encouraging and really try to help you meet your goals. The workouts are hard but good and I’ve gained a lot of strength in the last 6 weeks. Excited to continue!<//Review>

Sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination that matters. The last 6 weeks, I have gotten back to eating healthy, working out almost every morning, finding a protein drink I actually love (they really do exist!), and building a community of support for my health goals. Most importantly, I am celebrating and laughing at myself (No, Marcia, your hips need to go backwards!) as I realize my real goal was  to find a place where I would be encouraged every day to keep trying. Thanks to my coaches and friends I have made, this is only the beginning. Great workouts, great people, and great Fit Fam! Thanks, Results!!< /review>

I can honestly say this is the best gym I've ever been to. I've tried 24 hour, cross fit, Orange Theory, and Results in the past. Results is the one I keep coming back to. There is no gym like it! The fit fam you become part of immediately and the encouragement from coaches and staff are endless. They make it a point to have you feel part of the team.
The workouts are always challenging, always different, never boring, and super fun! It helps that the coaches walk around and truly watch every member to make sure they are using proper form. Oh and they will always give you an alternative move if you have limits or mobility issues. They really do care about their members! That's why I feel Results is the BEST gym out there!!</review>

Love the varieties of workouts, my fave is Tabata Tuesdays. I love the way Results Fitfam is a no judgement environment and fosters unity among members. Coaches Curtis and Stacie are  the best at challenging and helping me stay accountable in reaching goals and focusing on those “non scale victories”. My membership is an investment in me and RTC is a great value. Love my Fitfam!!! 💪🏻❤️<//Text>

I never knew I would enjoy a 5am workout so much! I used to oversleep for work now I get up at 4am to workout. This was one of the best decisions I made for myself and my family. I have gained energy, endurance, and feel great! It has been a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable, friendly and no nonsense people. All of the coaches truly care that you in the group of 40-50 people are getting your best work out so you can get the best benefit. I have truly enjoyed this experience! Thank you so much Results Sunrise!</text>

<time>1460436171823< /time><Text>I just completed my 6 week 20lb challenge and beat it by losing 21.4lbs! So happy with my victory I joined as a member immediately after with no question. This is not your typical gym, which I've tried them all, it's a new lifestyle support system. I always struggled being motivated in continuously going to the gym. The initial investment was a great incentive to try get back and basically get 6 weeks of training, meal planning and support for free! Yes concur the challenge and get all your money back. I ended up getting the 6 weeks for free and now have become a member because it is worth every penny. The coaches are the best, they are very attentive to challengers and members. The challengers and members themselves are all so positive and encourage each other. Everyone eventually gets to know one another over time because we all have the same purpose. This is a place to get results, that no other gym will give you. I've seen all the challengers and myself get stronger and skinnier within the last 6 weeks. I'm extremely happy to continue my journey to get even stronger and leaner. Good luck to you and you won't regret joining, it just might be the best investment for yourself.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I took the challenge and All I can say is that is been  the best decision I have ever made.  I have been to different gyms but felt lost and like I  didn't fit in, no one guides you or calls you and give you the extra push you need to achieve your goals.  But Results Transformation Center  is all and beyond what  everyone says and what I was expecting. I am so glad I found them and now belong to this gym and the fit fam. The support you get from them is incredible.  If you have try everything and nothing worked like I did, try them and see yourself transform into someone new.<//Review></record>

<gmapID>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb< /gmapID><review>Round 2 :
I lost a total of 6 lbs this challenge. I was not able to make my 20 lbs but I have gained lot of confidence and have become very strong. I have toned down my body and have lost lot of inches. I have lot of non scale victories like I am able to fit better in my old clothes which were just lying in my closet as they had stopped fitting me. I can walk run now. I can lift very heavy and workout all 7 days without getting tired. I am definitely going to be a member of results as results have really made all that money and effort worth it.

Round1
This is the best gym I have ever seen. The coaches are super friendly and they always push you to do your best. They understand and are always ready to answer any questions. Everyday the only thing I look forward to is going to the gym at 4.30 pm, and then wait again for the next day. Its super fun with a lot of high intensity exercises. They make you do things you never thought you'll ever be able to do.
Thanks results team for making it possible for me to lose 20.4 lbs in 6 weeks. I am totally in it and all ready to lose another 20 and get fitter each and every day.

Awesome gym.. I did the 6 week challenge and lost 21.2 lbs. So happy with my results. All the coaches are great but my favorite is coach Curtis. No excuses is his approach and I'm doing moves I never thought I would be able to do.
This is where they failed.
After my challenge I was given an option to become a member which I would love to become, but It wasn't the offer that my sister was given after her challenge she had just completed. I was told that if I lost 20 lbs my payment would roll over to pay the monthly installments of 99 per month. Hopefully they will be able to offer me the same as my sister received.<//Text>

When I walked into Results Transformation Sunrise I had no idea what to expect. I was greeted by Coach Will with a high five and a great, energetic attitude. That scared me even more! The first workout was HARD, as was every workout after that. However, as I went in each day, dreading it when I left work, when I walked in to workout I remembered I was with friends and the staff made it feel like home.

Coach Will, Coach Curtis, Coach Randy and Coach John kicked my butt every single day, but it was worth every second. I also knew they were doing something right because I felt like I was going to die. Results Transformation Sunrise it's hands down THE BEST gym I've ever been to. (I've gone to a lot) and this will be the ONLY gym I will ever go to again. This gym, and these people make me feel better than I've ever felt.<//Review>

Even throughout my military career I have not come across anyone in fitness as motivating as the coaches at Results. I think the quality of the gym is good and the workouts are great and never boring. You will see results as long as you stay consistent and stick to the plan they have designed for you.

<response>None<//response><rate>5<//rate><text>My wife asked me to accompany her to an orientation for Results. As I sat and listened to Matt talk, I knew it was time for change. All my questions were answered and I signed on the dotted line. I really had no idea what I was in store for but figured I didn't have anything to lose.

What I found when I walked into Results was an extremely attentive group of coaches. I explained to them the limitations I had with my lower back and not only did they take the time to show me different modifications they helped show me how to stretch and target my problem areas.

As I got stronger my daily workouts were modified specifically for me. Heavier weights were added and my coaches always made sure I was pushing myself hard in order to obtain the goals I had set.  When I had questions about meal planing my coach was never farther than an email away.

I am extremely happy with my journey at Results. Because of their program and my hard work I completed my challenge successfully. Yes, I could take my money and run but instead I signed up as a member. This program works!< /text></record>

<review>I joined this gym January 11, 2016.  Nervous, energized and curious.  Today I finished a 6 week challenge and the journey to my weight loss was incredible! I lost 22.2 pounds!
The coaches at Sunrise are fantastic. They teach, push, motivate, assist and coach.  The group exercise classes are incredible.  Not only do they give us exercises in a way that is fun, hard, and self challenging, but you get split up into smaller groups, and we cheer each other on to completion.  The nutrition was easy to follow. They give you a complete list, and just stick to it!  They say Nutrition is 70-80% success for a weight loss program, and I believe it to be true, but the work outs are body changing.  Modifications are available for any fitness level.  When my challenge came to an end, I went to the supermarket to get good, and found myself only buying things off the list.  This was and is a life changing event, which I encourage EVERYONE to participate in!</review>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><Name>Craig Wilson< /Name><Text>I just completed my second 6 week challenge with Results Transformation Center at the Sunrise location and what can I say:  Another 20 lbs and overall, in thirteen weeks, close to 55 lbs.  I started at an extremely ugly 265 fat, lousy, pounds and now I am pushing 210.  My goal is 190 but I'm pretty sure I should be able to continue on to maybe 180!

I have to be honest, it was a struggle, this last challenge.  The weight was not coming off as fast as the first challenge, which I guess is to be expected, but....who the f^^k cares, I did it, and with that said, even turned my success into a membership for the next year.  This is the best deal -- if you don't mind the coaches (Lea, John, Curtis, Aj, Consuela and the rest) yelling at you, motivating you, pushing you to do things that you haven't done in a very long time.

And we (members, challengers) all share pretty much of same goals, have fun, sweat, and look better.  Thank God, Costco's got cheap pants, because, it looks like I'll be downsizing a bit during this next year.  I started wearing a size 40 stretch pants with no belt -- now 38's are too lose with the belt tightened all the way.

As far as the menu goes, the food is what it is -- better for me.  Turkey, lean beef, fish, veggies all the way, protein shakes and the works, and I'm never hungry.

Who knows how far I'll go, but I do have a few goals -- 1) Matt, if ever need a speaker at one of your presentations, I'm volunteering, and 2) I want my beast mode, and 3) my picture on the wall at Sunrise!

Finally -- To all at Sunrise, Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!<//Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
It is my absolute pleasure to write my testimonial for Results!  I will freely admit that I was skeptical about their claims of loosing 20 lbs in 6 weeks.  Sure, young people could do it, but I am 45 and everything I’ve read says it’s so hard to lose weight after 40.  However, I was exhausted all the time, my clothes didn’t fit, and my blood pressure was rising higher and higher.  I figured “what the heck, anything is better than what I was doing,” and the 42 days was going to pass by whether I chose to help my self or not.  So I bit the bullet and signed up.

In the beginning I was so uncoordinated and nervous, but now I’m able to hold a plank, do many push-ups in a row, and I generally feel great!  Learning to eat according to the plan was challenging at first, but I found that my will is stronger than my stomach and after a week or so it was easy to stick to the food plan (STTFP).  Plus, everyone was so friendly at the gym that I was happy and excited to go everyday.

Thanks to the amazing coaches at Results and the plan they have put together, anyone can succeed if they just follow the simple directions.  This program has changed my life.  Give it a chance to change your life too.< /Review>

This review is long over due . I signed up in 2019 and I completed the 6 week challenge . I didn’t win the money because I only lost 11 lbs which was a lot of weight to loose , but the catch is you have to have a lot of fat to loose (no offense). I was really happy with my results I decided to sign up for a contract , which was $777 for 7 months . This was great at the time because I enjoyed the staff , facility and workouts . Soon I realized this gym is meant for people who work 9-5 or unemployed people. Not meant for college students who have inconsistent schedules . My issue was trying to get there at the times they have their classes I believe their first class was 5:00am and last was 9 or 10 . Then no classes til 5:00pm. I am still a full time student plus work 25+ hours a week. Once school started I had no time due to early classes and late night shifts . I was disappointed in myself for paying a contract that I couldn’t fully complete . That was my lost . The issue began once I noticed they had been charging my card after the contract was over . My contract was suppose to be over December 2019. They continued to take payments Jan, feb and March. I called to talk to Will to fix that . He explained that i supposedly agreed to a renewal after my contract , which I did not . He tells me he will take March off and not the other months . Mind you this is $135 they are taking a month. He sends me my copy of my contract for me to only find out he illegally added the renewal with out my consent . Meaning when I signed up I signed the document on the initial agreement and then he slipped in the renewal. Make sure you are aware and you don’t get scammed because I thought they cared about me and hr shortly showed me that all they care about is the money and how to get over on you . This place is good if u need a personal trainer , but that’s it . It’s not a gym with a bunch of equipment that is easy to use on your own time . You might as well workout at home .< /review>

<review>This gym is unlike any other gym I've ever been to! It's an energetic atmosphere full of people of all different levels, shapes, and sizes.  I highly recommend this place!  I just completed two rounds of the 6 week weight loss challenge and feel amazing.  It was the toughest journey I've ever gone through but the daily workouts and support helped me reach a goal I never thought I could reach only  4 months after having babies.  Try it out for yourself and see why everyone is talking about it!< /review><Rate>5</Rate><GmapID>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb</GmapID>< Pictures>

<user>106224026863826575232< /user><review>I just took the 20lb challenge with Results. Although I didn't make it to the 20 lbs. I did loose weight and inches. I enjoyed the atmosphere at the gym, the coaches, and the members. Everyone was great! I can say that I have learned a lot through the process as far as diet and exercise. I have stayed on as a member because I enjoy the workouts so much. They kick my butt every time I show up. I would recommend Results to anyone who is looking for a change in themselves. Regardless of whether or not you need to loose a lot of weight or if you are just looking for a place to workout, meet great people and become more physically fit! So happy I signed up and can't wait to get to my goal! I know I will with the help of Results!</review><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

Such a great workout for those who are looking for a challenge. The group style workouts make it motivating and fun, but there is still plenty of space to focus on you. The staff is very helpful and some of the trainers are downright awesome.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I am someone who REALLY, really likes to research things before I do them.  Results was no different.  I went to two orientations prior to enrolling, and my only regret is that I didn't sign up sooner.  I hesitated time and time again, but eventually it became clear that nothing else was working--it was time to do it, and I am so beyond glad that I did.  Let me clarify, I am not one of those people who looooves eating healthy and can't wait to go to the gym.  I am more of a skip on my way to the fridge type of girl and call it a day.  Results, however, is changing all of that.  I am beginning to see food as fuel, not as an emotional crutch.  My favorite part of the program is the workouts.  They are HARD, but I love it.  One of the best parts of the workouts is that I have NEVER, ever felt anything close to judged.  It is regular to give each other high fives, hear words of encouragement from teammates, and get cheered on by your coaches.  I lost 23 lbs during my first 6 week challenge.  I am beginning my second, and am so happy to have found Results.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I just can't say enough about Results Transformation Center. Thanks to the coaches, I have lost a total of 37.6 pounds in the two challenges that I participated in. I have also gone from a size 14 to a size 8. And most important, I feel stronger and healthier than I have in a long time. They have helped me gain my confidence back.

It's not just the coaches; it is everyone at the gym. The entire fit fam is so supportive and non-judgmental; I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.

It's hard work, but it is so worth the Results! I recommend this gym to anyone who is looking for a place to fit in, who wants support and advice from real coaches, and who just is looking to change their lives.

I checked out other gyms, but none of them had the same feel that Results does. It truly is an amazing gym!< /review>< userid>

After the 1st workout I wanted out after 3 knee surgeries and heading towards knee replacement I thought there's no way my knees are going to hold up, I talked to Coach Curtis the following workout and he modified my workouts perfectly to match my body, I was Red Lighted on shoulders as well and the modifications were perfect, I have much more mobility in my knees and shoulders than I've had in years and my Energy Level is through the roof, I can't give enough props to the entire Results Crew, they were all accessible and helpful every step of the way, look forward to a great boating season where I won't be embarrassed to take off my shirt!.

<review>100% recommend this gym for anyone who is committed to get RESULTS. The workouts have modifications available so any level can benefit. The diet is easy to understand and follow. As long as you make your workouts and STTFP you WILL succeed! The coaches are supportive and helpful, encouraging every step of the way, I never once just felt like a member, I felt like part of the RESULTS FAMILY.

After working out and sticking to the meal plan, I feel stronger, healthier, and have learned self discipline to accomplish the goals I set for myself.

I had reached a stand still in my weight loss journey before doing the Results 6 week 20 lb challenge. The coaches here are absolutely phenomenal they make you feel like they are  your personal trainer, they got me so excited to come in 5 days a week to exercise that I actually would have wanted to come in seven days a week except for I know my body needs to rest. They pushed me to always do my best and to work towards getting even stronger.  I am a returning Challenger going into round 2 since I lost 27.4 pounds in my first round! I can't say for sure that I would ever have lost that much weight in 6 weeks on my own without the help of results Transformation Center!< /Text>

Awesome!!
I'm an alumni challenger who came from the Arden/Howe gym. While I was a tad bit skeptical and loyal to my original "home gym," this place kicks ass!!! They are uber professional and require that you bring your game in a healthy way. They challenge you while being careful that every exercise is being executed correctly. There's a great balance going on here and I'm grateful to have found such an awesome place to work out. One hour a day and the results you get?? Priceless!! Good job team Sunrise!< /text>

Terrific place ! I always fascinated being fast and strong to play the different sports I love, but lacked the motivation to do the hard work involved. Results motivated me and drove me to a new level of fitness which I never had before. I feel like I am back on track and pumped to loose weight the right way.

<review>I'm happy to say that I completed the six week challenge and lost 20.6 lbs.  It was definitely hard but worth it.  It's not just about the weight loss.  Sure that's a huge factor but for me it's also about the people you meet there and the strength you gain both inside and out.  You really can push yourself more than you think.  The coaches are so nice at Sunrise and they help motivate you.  Thats what I needed.  So I'm on to my next challenge.  :)<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

Just completed the famous 6 week 20lbs challenge and this gym is the bomb!!! I lost 23 pounds in 6 weeks , yep that's right 6 short weeks I lost that much! It's no fad diet nor gimmicks, just hard work, dedication and a very supportive and friendly staff to help you along the way! If you are looking for a place to motivate you and help kickstart your fitness look no more! Any other gym Is a waste of time and money! Invest in yourself and choose the best!< /Review>

I have successfully completed my second weight loss challenge at this amazing gym. You too have an opportunity to lose 20 lbs. in 6 weeks at no cost if successful. If you are ready to commit to your weight loss goal, I encourage you to sign up for the next orientation. During this journey you will learn healthy eating habits, gain strength and confidence, and begin a new life style. As a bonus, you will make friends and have fun!</review>

Results every time. Accountability, support, camaraderie, coaching, and meal planning. Varied functional fitness, upbeat, energetic music. They foster community and inspiration! I'm a big fan of results and the people we're surrounded by. Any time I stop going, I end up returning. Because I get results... every time.<//Text>

< Review>
I am very proud to say that I successfully completed the first 6 week challenge with a loss of 23.6 lbs. I will be going on the second 6 weeks. I had a rough start in the first couple weeks because I didn't (STTFP) but once I did the weight started to come off fast. The coaches are awesome at Sunrise Results Transformation Center. On my first day I thought I was going to die from the exercise and I almost wanted to give up, but the coaches and few others that i was working out with kept saying you can do it!!! So I kept pushing and I kept going day after day and then I started to see changes in my body, My aches and pains from the weight I was carrying started to go away. I was able to fit into a few pair of my old jeans that had been in my closet for years... I am now able to bend over and tie my shoes without any problem. I have more energy than I have had in years. I can honestly say that starting the challenge is the best decision I have made for 2016 and I plan to lose even more in the second round. Results Transformation Center is definitely the place to be!!!</Review>

Results Transformation Center is an awesome gym. The coaches are very supportive and the workouts are a challenge, as they should be. I was skeptical at first but after losing 5 lbs during my first week I was convinced. At the end of my challenge I lost a total of 20 lbs. I couldn't be more proud of myself. Thank you to all the coaches for their words of encouragement and support! Results has been that push I needed towards a healthier lifestyle.</Review>

<Review>Results was exactly what I needed to get my weight loss jump started. I had been trying on my own with not much progress. I completed the 20 lb challenge and I’m so glad I did, I dropped 21.8 lbs a few months before my wedding. (I went from 168.6 to 146.8) The eating was definitely the hardest part, but committing to the challenge was the motivation I needed to just do it and stop making excuses. The workouts were great and the trainers are so positive and supportive, but they also know when to tell you to pick up the pace and challenge you to push yourself. Believe it or not I did enjoy going there and met a lot of good people during my 6 weeks.</Review>< userid>

I just finished the Alumni challenge and lost 16.2 lbs in 5 weeks!  The coaches are great at modifying workouts and customizing moves to fit your situation and the meal plan works!  I could never do this on my own going to a box gym!< /review>

My weight loss journey accelerated when I committed to the 6 week challenge. The support from the staff and the group workout sessions has inspired me to experience real transformation beyond the challenge. I am now a member and I'm living a lifestyle of transformation. Results has given me the tools I need to be successful.< /text>

<time>1460605533813<//time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>My experience at Results Transformation Center Sunrise was incredible. I came in to this 6 week challenge in a horrible state. I had not really exercised in 8 years due to injuries and complications from 2 head-on collisions in 5 years. Once I had my doctor's ok to exercise (with modifications), I decided I should go all out to get back in the game. What I love about Results is they work with you as an individual. They can modify your workout so that you get the most out of it without hurting yourself. This was one of my big issues. My worries were quickly relieved when I was given a thorough screening. I am now doing things I never, ever imagined I would do! This has been a life changing experience and I am so grateful!<//Review>< pics>

Results is not just the place that has helped me to lose weight, it is my home, my sanctuary. I realize more and more with each day and each empowering workout how much Results has impacted my life in a positive way. I feel better about my body's abilities as well as my physical appearance. I feel welcomed by the coaches and staff every time I walk in, and by the other members or challengers who I meet, that understand what I'm going through more than anyone else in some ways. When I have had a lousy day and all I want to do is go home and get in to bed to forget about it, I choose instead to go to Results where it never fails to put a smile on my face by the time I leave. Almost every day I am there I realize new strengths or push myself to new limits. I think everyone needs to experience it in the life-changing way that I did, but you will never know unless you give Results a chance, and also believe in yourself!! If you are tired of the habits you have formed in your daily life, or the clothes that you keep saving but can never lose weight to fit in to, then you NEED to come to Results; it will be the best decision you ever made!!!</text>

<Text>I just finished my second challenge and have lost 44 pounds total. After 12 weeks, I am getting my money back and putting it right back into a membership at Results. I am in the best shape i've been in since playing lacrosse in college, all my old clothes from college fit, and I am confident and happy. I look forward to every workout and to getting stronger with the help of the coaches at Results. I was skeptical to start and after I finished my first challenge my mind was changed, but I didn't think I would be able to make the second challenge. I was able to push myself and be pushed by the coaches and others at the gym and succeeded beyond what I could have imagined. This is a 5 star program that will change your life if you put the work in and let it.</Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Results transformation centers are life savers, I'm done being lazy couch potato and they helped me snap back into the best me possible. I'm going into my second challenge and will most likely do a third. I really needed to kick myself into gear but didn't have the right motivation until I came across them via Facebook Ad in September. I'm so glad I attended the initial orientation, they motivate you to get the results you both strive for.
I am running the Philadelphia marathon in November and needed to start working out again to get prepared while also running 5/10K's events. I have done (2) 5K's this challenge and I'm right on track thanks to Results Transformation Center's. I've created a year calendar on my Mac that has all races until 2017, I'm making goals and turning them into actual plans!
The best part is they do it in a timely manner.  6 weeks to lose 20lbs? Yes please! I've been holding on to this extra weight the past two years and it is time to get rid of it for good.The plan they have really makes the weight come right off, STICK TO THE PLAN!
I tell all my friends and family about this place, they ask me and I love talking about it! It's my favorite place to go to in the mornings, it truly energizes me for my day. I can't image starting my day without working out. The staff is amazing, I love the workouts. The atmosphere is welcoming and inspiring, the coaches are great. You are forced to create healthy habits for yourself, I couldn't be more happy with my results... on to the next one!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I just completed my second 6wk challenge with Results with a total weight loss of 41.2 lbs.  I am so glad  I made the decision to invest in myself and would do it again any day of the week.  I worked my butt off, and there were times I felt like giving up but the support and encouragement from the coaches and the rest of the "transformers" is what kept me join til the end.  If you're concerned about the cost, don't be - you're worth it! !</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I first heard about Results through a coworker. I noticed she was looking amazing and her confidence level was crazy high. My sister went to an orientation and I heard about expensive it was and thought no way could I afford that. I thought about it for weeks and weeks. I have never really struggled with my weight. I have always been lucky enough to stay active and eat whatever I wanted. It was until I had a deep loss within my family, my brother passed away suddenly, and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, that made me go into a depression and use food as a comfort. I was drinking alcohol all the time and eating whatever I could get my hands on to make me forget about reality. I gained over 60lbs in just a short time. I stopped going out, stopped doing the things I loved. I had such a fake confidence that no one even believed me when I self I was very self-conscious.  I was really good at faking the smile. I remembered all of this and started telling myself this is not how my brother would want me to live my life. He would be so mad at me if he was here. So now for the happy part. I decided to work overtime at my job and sign up for Results with my sister. She went to an orientation with me and sat through it again. After hearing Matt speak I left there feeling like I could conquer the world with Results. The first day I was so scared and felt very self-conscious. My sister was with me so I knew I wasn’t alone in my feelings. I remember walking in and see Jayme’s smiling face and I thought ok she looks nice maybe this won’t be that bad. The coaches that day were amazing and very welcoming. They took the time to show us modifications for the movements that we couldn’t quite do yet and did not make us feel bad about it. The next few weeks got easier and we started making friends with other members and having jokes with our coaches. The meal prepping became easier and eventually became routine. I found myself sad on my rest days because I wanted to go to the gym. Being at the gym is such a positive, motivating and inspirational experience. It’s not just about the workouts or the meal prep, it’s the support that you get at Results. I feel like I have made the best decision of my life and I am never looking back. In my first six weeks I lost 22lbs and dropped two sizes in my clothes. My friends and family are saying how awesome I look and can tell my real confidence is coming back. I am running and being more active than I was before and I am loving it. Thank you so much to all the Coaches at Sunrise Results. SUNRISE….RISE UP!!< /Review>< pics>

I was skeptical at first and was nervouse at the same time when I decided to take on their 20lbs Challenge.  First few sessions were hard and something that I was still getting used to, but as time went on, it was more enjoyable.  The group work out sessions and the support of their coaches inspired and pushed me more to try harder and succeed.  The supportive atmosphere is hard to find in ANY gym, but it is present here.  When you are falling behind, there is ALWAYS someone to give you an encouraging word when you need it most.  This gym is fun, challenging, and something to SWEAT FOR!  Yes, in this gym I lost 25 lbs and I went from a border line 40 waist to a tight 36...AND THATS IN SIX WEEKS!  The prices are not cheap, but are affordable and are well worth it. You will love this place!<//Review>

<Text>I have been a member of results transformation center for several years and can’t imagine being anywhere else. These people that I workout with have become my family… my “fit fam”. I did the challenge as a member and I truly feel like it has set the tone for me going into 2021. I did all but one of my workouts from the comfort of my own home. The online (results anywhere) library is terrific and I love the live stream classes. The coaches are all great at keeping the workouts exciting and challenging too. They also offer many alternative exercise options for my troubled knee and old shoulder injury. I would recommend Results to anyone who is serious about their fitness goals. It is a fun, energetic, positive place plus they have a super supportive staff. I’ve never met anyone I did not like or was not positive and quick to offer help. The staff goes  beyond with checking in on us when we are not there (yes, they notice), helping you with setting goals as well as helping you achieve them, and always have great nutritional advice. The program doesn’t allow you to starve or waste away. It offers different options to suit what is best for your body’s needs.
Many many thanks to all the Results staff and my FitFam! 12.21.20 posted for Rancho Cordova location< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Just completed my 3rd round at results gym.  Lost another 20lbs.  Still the best decision I made for myself.  Lost over 70lbs total, dropped 3 shirt sizes since January.  Coming to this place is a daily routine now, it does not feel like a choir (some days are harder than others but still worth it!).  Thank you Jayme, Danny, JJ, Curtis and all of the other staff for making this a great place to be at and part of the fit fam.< /Text>

I am a return challenger.  I first took the 6 week challenge last year January 2015 and went on to complete 3 challenges then became a member.  What happened…vacation and I couldn’t get my head back into the game my fault CERTAINLY NOT a reflection of Results.  I struggled and finally said I need the accountability that the 6 week challenge provides me.  I cannot say enough how much I love Results and their coaches and my fitfam.  The coaches are tough but only because they see your potential when you don’t.  They are there to guide you thru the process and assist you in your success.  My advice to anyone who may be on the fence about a program you owe it to yourself to get the best you, what do you have to lose?    Results Transformation is the key to your success…make the decision and join the challenge you’ll never look back and you’ll be happy you did it.</Review>

<Text>I just completed the Results Transformation Center’s 6 week 20 pound Challenge and 22.8 pounds are gone! I say the pounds are “gone” because “lost” implies they can be found again and that’s not what Results is all about. The Results plan is about transformation and making a new commitment to healthy living. I don’t plan to “find” those pounds again. In fact, I’m on the path to getting rid of 20 more!

This 6 week challenge is about two things: healthy eating and working your body. The coaches give you a meal plan and ask you to work out 1 hour at least 5 days a week. It's “real food” you prepare however you want with approved ingredients and a couple of protein shakes thrown in for all the exercising. I’ve done weight loss plans before (Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and High Protein/Low Carb Meal Replacement Foods) and haven’t been successful keeping the weight off. This plan is different because I don’t have to learn how to eat “real food” after getting to my ideal weight – I’m eating it all along the way!

The workouts are challenging but also customizable to different fitness levels. The first few sessions were hard and my body was sore but, as time went on, it became more enjoyable and I felt myself getting stronger every day. The coaches are positive and supportive. They will push you hard but will also make sure that you are exercising safely and will teach you modifications if you have any injuries. When falling behind or feeling like giving up on a certain exercise, there is always someone to give you an encouraging word.

I won't lie and tell you it's easy because nothing worth anything is ever easy.  You will be amazed by how your life changes and how you grow though. I have a new mentality about food, water and exercising. Before the challenge I drank a lot of coffee and diet soda. After the challenge, I’d prefer water (I amazed myself that I could go 6 weeks without drinking anything other than water). At the end of a stressful work day, I would have opted for putting up my feet and grabbing a glass of wine. But now I look forward to getting to the gym for a sweaty workout!

If you’re looking for a gym to wear your cute outfits and you hair and makeup is perfect, this isn’t the place for you. If you’re looking for a fun and challenging workout in a supportive environment where you’ll make good friends and watch yourself transform, come check out Results Transformation Center.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I just completed my third challenge with an additional 21lbs down, which brings my total to 71lbs in 18 weeks! I am now feeling more confident, energetic, and no longer that couch potato from when I first started.  I am so grateful to Results Transformation Center, the coaches, and Fitfam.  I look forward to each work out and truly feel like I am missing out if I am unable to attend.  I look forward to seeing the warm smiling faces from all aspects of the gym.  I receive so much encouragement and motivation and it really means so much to me. I can now say I am able to do full burpees and run around the building without stopping. I push myself more because of the support of surrounding fitfam that want to see me do well.  Their encouragement allows me to be encouraging to someone else, and I am so appreciative.  With them, I push myself harder, aim to do better and have loved the whole process.
I received a wonderful compliment from a coach that said if only he recorded me when I first started to now, so I can see how far I’ve come.  That really put a smile on my face because I really give it my all when I’m there.  I know I’ve come a long way and want to accomplish so much more.  I completed this challenge and look forward to crushing round number 4.  I can’t wait to see these next results, If I feel this great now, the world better watch out in 6 more weeks!!!!<//Review>

This program is fantastic and worth every penny!! I am getting ready to start my 5th challenge with Results and in just 6 more short weeks I will have lost 100 pounds with this Results team! I started with Results in June 2015 and I completed 3 challenges back to back. I stopped after my 3rd challenge losing 75 pounds. I decided to become a member following my 3rd challenge. After the holidays I realized I needed this program to take me all the way to the end. So I started my 4th challenge in Jan 2016 and I not only lost the holiday weight, but I am only 6 more pounds from "one"derland!! I am finally reaching goals I thought were NEVER going to happen. This is the real deal!! There is nothing tricky about this program. They give you the tools and rules, you show up and follow them and you will see RESULTS! Simple as that. Its not easy making changes but if you are ready to make a change and you want to challenge a "money back guarantee" system and you are ready to feel good again, then do it here! you have nothing to lose but unwanted weight!! Good luck and hope to see you at the Sunrise location soon!</Text>

So I finally took the plunge and signed up for the six week 20 pound challenge. Best decision ever! I lost 30 lbs in six weeks and I feel amazing. These are exactly the kind of workouts I need to stay motivated and to push myself.

So I just finished my second challenge and it was another success!! To be honest it was more difficult than the first challenge but if you STTFP it will work for you. I'm also excited about my Non Scale Victories (NSV). When I started twelve weeks ago a could barely hold a plank or do a burpee. Now I can knock em out no problem (sorta). I'm excited to get started on my third challenge!< /review>

Seems like a good concept paying up front but if you lose a certain amount of weight you get your money back.  In reality be prepared to be pushed beyond your ability without the coach asking what your ability is, what your limitations are.  Be prepared to be punished if you don't put a name tag on- yep 30 burpees and this is even if you are not able to physically do one burpee on your second day in the program and you will not be told that you are required to put a name tag on every single day. You may or may not be told you can modify a push up, a plank or a burpee but be prepared that you may get reprimanded and penalized if you do modify an exercise.  No time to work up to  being able to perform a required routine, do it and do it strong or be called out and humiliated.  Are coaches told to hone in on certain people to get them to drop out.  I am thinking yes- after all then the owners get to keep the clients $400.00 without that client even taking up a position in the class.  I wondered how this gym makes money if they give back the money paid up front - at least $400.00 if you lose 20 pounds..well after spending two days- minus five minutes when I walked out- I am pretty sure I know.  I wish everyone injured or put into a medical emergency in this program would post here- and don't ever think about getting your money back or having anyone who works at this gym or is a business partner in this gym understanding any of its downfalls.  After all - they are getting rich!<//text>

I finally joined Results after seeing one of the moms of a kid who plays softball with my daughter coming to the games with her food and protein shakes and eating on schedule while we all scarfed down the crappy snack bar food. After a while I saw her slimming down and then the light bulb went on in my head that it was time to do what she was doing. I’ve lost weight and gained muscle before, on my own, which is one of the main reasons I didn’t join Results sooner – I kept saying to myself “When I’m ready I can do it on my own again. I don’t need to pay $500 to have someone tell me what to eat and how to exercise in order to lose weight!” But in fact, that is EXACTLY what I needed! The first week of the program I felt horrible because they make you do fitness testing to determine the exercises that you can/cannot do, for safety reasons. I am an athletic person but when I discovered that I was too out of shape to do a squat or lunge the proper way it depressed the heck out of me! I wanted to quit that night, but I remembered Matt and all the other speakers at the orientation saying, “Don’t quit, just finish the program.” So I did.

Over the course of 6 weeks I went from not being able to squat properly to being able to do a full squat holding 20 lb weights. I’ve gone from having little knowledge about the proper supplementation to use, to knowing exactly what to take before, during, and after my workouts to maximize the results. I’ve gone from a woman with very little discipline to a woman disciplined enough to prepare my meals ahead of time and eat on schedule. This program has helped me kick my sugar and caffeine addiction and to care more about what I put into my body. Since starting results my daughter, who is an athlete, is beginning to eat better and to be mindful about how she fuels her body as well. Yes I lost 24.2 pounds on my first round of the challenge, but the non-scale victories outweigh those pounds by far.

I will end by warning you, this program is NOT easy and if you’re like me you will have to deal with your abnormal emotional connection to food, which can take a toll on you. Understand that you will have to eat according to the meal plan while everyone else around you grubs on whatever they want. So at birthday parties and holidays you’ll have to bring your own food or stay home to avoid succumbing to temptation. And alcohol is out of the question! The workouts are intense and you will be pushed, in a loving but firm way, not only by the coaches but by the other challengers. You will be held accountable in this challenge, and your level of success solely depends on how hard you are willing to work both in the gym and in the kitchen. Really check in with yourself before committing to this program, if you are not ready to be focused and disciplined then this is not the program for you. But if you are ready to eat clean and train hella dirty, then join us – it’ll be the most transformative six weeks of your adult life.< /review>

I am very proud to share how excited I am about the Results Transformation  that has occurred in my life due to this life changing Gym. In the 6 weeks that my challenge took place, I gained so much, just not weight!  I have learned to trust that my body can do so much, given the right training and support.  My 2 nephews and niece and brother have been successful and I had seen such a difference in their bodies and stamina, I decided to go to the orientation, along with Julia, my daughter. We both decided to join the challenge.  I was impressed each and every workout at the caliber of the workouts and trainers/coaches and the support of the members and other 'challengers'.  Everyone is cheering you on both in the workouts and the results. I loved not having to think about what I was going to do at the 'gym', as I had in the past ( although I wasted so much money not going...). When Matt Weaver explained at orientation why Results was different and why the other gym mentality I had didn't work, I knew I was committed to do this.  And I did!  I lost over 23 lbs, and am able to do more each workout.  It does take discipline and planning, but I was determined to be healthier.  The coaches help with modifications for any physical issues and are very concerned about each person's success. Kudos to JJ, Curtis, Consuelo, Brydan, Danny and Will, as well as my new Fit Family to helping me.  I am starting my 2nd challenge and very excited about how much stronger and healthier I can become!</Text>

<Review>Results Transformation Center is unlike any other gym I have ever been too.  The coaches and staff are amazing ----They motivate you and push you to do your best, help with proper form, and give modifications based on any injuries you have or inability to do a certain exercise.  The classes are pretty difficult and you can push yourself and maximize your efforts to make the workout that much better.  A lot of the workout are simple types of exercises --- squats, push ups, wall ball's, and burpees.... lots of burpees.  And if you think you can't do a burpee, you will be able to after a very short time I promise!  And then there is your fit fam.... the most amazing and motivating group of people, who are there, just like you.  To have fun, get an amazing and hard workout, learn about nutrition and suppliments to help you make it through the workout, and overall, it makes you feel like a true family.  I can't recommend Results enough besides to say that if you have been unhappy with your diet or eating habits, need to loose weight and make some lifestyle changes, and the box type gyms are not fitting the bill (because they don't).... Try Results.  If you put in MAXIMUM EFFORT, you will get MAXIMUM RESULTS!  Sunrise..... RISE UP!< /Review>< pictures>

I was inspired by a couple of friends who did this challenge earlier and amazed by their transformation. It had been a while I was looking to shed a few pounds and bascially be more fit and energetic. Results was the place to go.

It was definately not easy, one of the most challenging 6 weeks of my life but the small victories during that period kept me going. Sticking to the food plan was the crucial part of the plan and more challenging for a vegetarian. Coaches at results helped me out at each and every step be it meal planning, tweaking them when it wasnt working well and pushing us to the brink at every exercise session. A big shout to coach Lea who was replying to my messages during her vacation just so that my meal plan is tweaked at the right time. This is an example of the amazing dedication these coaches have towards all the challengers.

To start with I never thought I would have made my 20 pound, but with all the tips and pointers I could finally do it, much to my amaze. I feel much lighter, could run much faster than before and rock most of my classes too. Greatest joy is fitting into your old clothes which would have never been possible otherwise.

Thanks fit fam, coaches and results at sunrise. I am a proud member of the gym and looking to get better each day.<//Review>

I started the challenge a week ago and I'm very nervous.  I don't know how I'm going to lose the 20 lbs. Please read the following review from a year ago......   the experience of lori brown is my experience EXACTLY! !!  very disappointed!  You are on your own, they don't teach proper form, don't allow proper warm up, don't teach you to breath. They mention it, but in passing only. It's up to you , really!!! To get your money back. LISTEN CLOSELY!!! YOUR MONEY IS BETTER SPENT ON A PERSON AL TRAINER.

When you're done feeling sorry for yourself, tired of being tired, ready to start living again, and done being the person you said you would "NEVER BE!!!" When you're tired of hiding from mirrors, and social gatherings, and pictures. When you decide YOU ARE WORTH IT. Run, don't walk, to your nearest Results Transformation Center. Whether you need to lose 20 or 200 this is the place. If you don't want coaches who care, to work out with people that will become your family, and be pushed and motivated while you reach your fitness goals, this is NOT the place for you. This is NOT your typical big box gym...you WIll be greet...you will be shown how to use the equipment...you will be cared about...you will be shown how to make this a lifestyle...you WILL succeed here. Will it be hardwork? YES. WIll it be worth it? NO DOUBT. This isn't just a gym, its a 2nd home. As an ex athlete, now 41 years old, four kids later, I have found my strength, competitiveness, and love for what my body is capable of again. Thank you Results Sunrise with just one round of the 20lb challenge, you have given me mental, and physical health back. Here's to another round and becoming a member.</Text>

<review>I'll take this moment to thank my friends, family, coaches and the random supporters I have had  throughout this first round of the #results20 challenge.  Regardless of circumstance it's nice to know that ones drive and faith can overcome any assortment of obstacles put in front of you.  Special thanks to Coach Lea, Coach JJ, Coach Curtis, Coach Rachel, Coach Brydon, Coach Will, Jayme and the whole results family - you are truly amazing.  Weight loss for round 1 was 46.6 lbs and the drive to get there was as much mentally challenging as physically.  The friendships built and belief in yourself are worth more than any amount of money.  I look forward to the 2nd round and the the goal set forth the second I came off the scale - beat round 1. :)  There aren't enough good things to say about this program, the gym or the people.  See you around!</review><Gmap_id>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb< /Gmap_id><UserId.>106720464294522812739<//UserId.>< pics>

<Text>I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about Results before I began. I mean, how could I lose 20lbs in 6 weeks! I really didn’t eat that poorly and had tried personal training before so what did they do what was so different? At the same time I wanted results and trying on my own, meaning 1-2 weeks of giving my all at the gym with an hour cardio and an hour weights wasn’t moving the dial like I wanted/needed. After seeing two friends on Facebook succeed through Results, I decided, what else do I have to lose besides time (which will pass anyway) and money (which I can potentially get back). I decided to sign up and I am so happy I did. I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging the workouts were considering the differing fitness levels of members. I was also surprised by the attention to detail and proper form considering the class size to coach ratio. I always felt like there was assistance when needed. The only negatives I can think of are: 1. The first week’s works for M-F repeated on week 2 and week 5’s work outs repeated on week 6.  2. The coach’s tend to play the same music on from their play lists so it can be a bit repetitive, i.e. it’s Monday so, ___ workout, with ___ music. However, the positives, by far, outweigh any negatives. The coaches are all very enthusiastic and it honestly feels genuine, the fellow challengers and members are all positive and encouraging and well, it’ s not called results for nothing! Over 6 weeks I lost the 20lbs, was it easy? No! but was it worth the effort, time and money?! Yes! I am so pleased with the overall quality of workouts and the atmosphere that I decided to become a member.  I highly recommend Results and plan on continuing my fitness goals at their facility. Their staff is the best of any I’ve experienced (Cal-Fit, 24-hour, Anytime, etc.). They get to know you, your goals, your strengths and weakness and welcome you with open arms.  They support and push you (when you need it) to meet you goals. I’m happy that I took a chance with results.</Text>< userid>

<time>1456717973931</time><rating>5</rating><Text>I'm going to start by saying if you are on Yelp, Google, FB, etc. reading reviews on gyms, look no further. Results is the gym you want to go to. I can say that with confidence because Results changed my life. Most people can't say that about a gym. Do I have your attention now?
My story is short and sweet: I am 23 years old and in the year I spent planning my wedding I gained around 20 pounds. That was on top of the 15 I had gained from being happy and in a relationship. I went in to the doctors office for a routine visit and to my surprise the number '180.5' was staring back at me on the scale. I wanted to cry and I knew something had to change. I needed to change. I already had a membership a small gym that has nice equipment but I lack motivation. I am not the kind of person that can walk into the gym and know what I'm going to do. Even with my 'workout' board on Pinterest, I got nothing.
When I heard about Results, I was skeptical. But when I went to the orientation, all my scepticism disappeared. Results is a gym that requires work and dedication. They aren't about pre-packaged food plans or juice cleanses. You eat real food that you cook. You work out with coaches that push you to be your best and you are amongst friendly faces that support you. The environment is upbeat and clean with huge superhero murals covering the walls. You aren't greeted by empty, daunting machinery, but smiling coaches and friends ready to give you a high five. And, my favorite part: you aren't starving. Ever. When you stick to the plan, you are eating every 2.5-3 hours. You have three meals and three snacks, so no starvation going on.
I will say, the 6 week Challenge was not easy. You have to be ready to sweat, and I mean really sweat. But it was EXACTLY what I needed. By the end I lost 21 pounds but I gained so much confidence. I feel healthy again. I am able to fit into most of my old cloths which I didn't think was possible. I am in love with myself again. I still have some work to do, but now I know I can do it. The 6 week Challenge is not just a 'challenge', it's a healthy lifestyle change. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to try it.<//Text>< Pictures>

I am just your average college student. I go to school full time during the mornings, I go to work full time during the evenings, and then I spend the rest of the day sleeping and wondering why I put myself through so much stress and don’t feel any happier. Then I saw this quote by Charles Bukowski. “If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it’s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.” My epiphany hit me like a wrecking ball. Life before all the stress was full of physical activity. I lived for the thrill of physical exertion…but lately I’ve been so bummed because I haven’t been living my passion. After that quote I read an ad for Results Transformation. Like everyone else on Facebook, I scrolled passed it quiet a few times before I finally got the courage to give it a go. I was apprehensive because I’ve done the “gym thing” before. You’re there on your own sweating it out and it gets boring after a while, you forget to go, you get sidelined by an injury, and you start making other excuses for why you can’t go. It’s easy to fall off the wagon. But Results was so much more than your average gym! They gave me a nutrition plan, helped me find my whys: keeping up with my speedy little sister, finishing a Spartan Race with my athletic friends, and seeing that 6 pack again! When I told my coach I screwed up my shoulder, she was quick to show me modifiers and corrective exercises to help my aching muscles. I was offered a supportive forum to speak with others about my difficulties during the challenge, both metal and physical difficulties. I was offered so much more support than I had ever received at any gym I had gone to before. My coaches and fitfam at Results Transformation became my reason for continuing with Results after the 6 week 20 pound challenge. I’m now a member of the most awesome place I’ve ever had the pleasure of sweating at and I couldn’t be happier! If you are anything like me, then I’d highly recommend putting away the pizza, getting off the couch, and giving them a go. See ya there!</text>

My wife wanted me to give up alcohol for six weeks and spend that money to loose 20 pound in weight loss challenge and this whole experience changed my lifestyle and how I view my health and fitness.  It wasn't easy at the beginning of the challenge but at the end of six weeks I felt it was one of the best decision ever made . I not only lost 20 pounds but my perception changed a lot on many of things .

1. I can fit to my old clothes which I had from graduation ( 8 yrs old ) yet new clothes since I never got a chance to wear them .
2. I feel energised during the entire day after morning workout . I feel I am more productive , active both managing work and personal life .
3. Fit Fam - coach , people at this gym are so supportive and fun.The coaches at Sunrise are extremely helpful and answer all our dumb questions about fitness and clean eating.
4. Now I have new perspective about workout and eating habits . I have made changes even after the 6 week challenge to maintain the weight which I lost which is key to success . I feel discipline should be for life time and not just for six weeks . So I ended up becoming a Fit Fam member after my 6 week challenge .
5. I have gained self confidence , discipline , perseverance.

This 6 week challenge was about eating clean , work out and sticking to the STTFP.. The coaches customized meal plan , reviewed the plan and made sure we stick to it .  They made us work out at least 5-6 days a week. I also made sure I did a 30 -45 cardio in the evening since I used to go to gym in the morning .The six week challenge isn't easy but doable . I lost almost 23 pounds in 6 weeks and now a proud member of the club.

I highly encourage anyone considering this to make an investment in themselves . It will be a lie changing experience and you will life from an different angle .

Thank you guys !< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><userid>107588444889515586989</userid><review>Results....this is definetly a gym that lives up to its name, if you put in the work and stick to the plan results is what you will get. If you are ready to make a change in your life and surround yourself wirh positive, motivated people all working towarda the same common goal this is the place for you.
The coaches are awesome and are there to motivate you and push you to help you reach your full potential. They are knowledgable and most of all care about each challenger/member and care about helping you reach your short and long time fitness goals. After six weeks I guarantee that you will feel stronger, confident and a sense of accomplishment that you have not felt before. After my first challenge I lost a total of 22.4 pounds and I cannot wait for the 2nd challenge to begin. There is no other gym that offers pwrsonalized trainning up to 7 days a week as well as a meal plan, not to mention the wonderful motivated staff willing to help you reach your goals and achieve success.

I must start off again by thanking the wonderful staff of the Rancho Cordova – Sunrise location for being an AMAZING STAFF and THE BEST MOTIVATORS.  I was 333lbs when I started round 1 but knew that I had to do this challenge again because my body fat and BMI were still no in the proper range.  I’m grateful this rules are in place because in reality I knew that I NEEDED to do it one more time.
Many things stand out about this challenge for a round 1, 2 and 3 person.  First, the coaches were and continued to be SMART, MOTIVATING and ACCOMIDATING!  In most of todays’ gyms you rarely find that, let alone all THREE!  Second, this program continues to make YOU accountable and gives you the structure and plan to succeed.  Third, YOU can succeed if you STICK TO THE PLAN that they give you no matter how many rounds you do.  I stuck to the plan 95% of the time and for that I was rewarded with a total weight loss of 76lbs!
I had my 3rd final weigh-in on February 15th and was so happy to see that I had lost an additional 26.4lbs in my 3rd 6 WEEKS!  I have now lost a total of 76lbs exactly in 18 WEEKS!  There are no gimmicks here and never were, only hard work and dedication by the challengers and coaches at RESULTS TRANSFORMATION CENTER.  I’m proud to say that I completed all 3 of my challenges and would become a member in a HEARTBEAT!  Everyone should know that by sticking to the plan and listening to the coaches and staff at RESULTS, they will succeed time and time again and make their goal of losing 20lbs or MORE in just 6 short weeks.
Thank you RESULTS GYM and Coaches for showing me what can be done!

<Text>VERONICA is Awesome. She has great hands when cutting, and while conversing she taught me a lot about hair , how to cut bangs for my daughter etc. 😊 I recommend if you need a good cut and dye at a good price.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
These two sisters started this shop years ago.  They are truly pleasant and professional.   Their pricing is excellent for cuts and color.   I have been coming here for over 10 years and I have always been happy with their work.< /Review>

<text>It's a very quiet little place but they are fast and did a great job. The price was amazing had about 10 to 12 inches cut off and new style and Vernonica did it in 25 minutes! I left happy and plan to be back. My husband now wants to go. It's nice to find a place that does great cuts without that huge price tag.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Very unprofessional, no masks ANYWHERE. None of the barbers followed safety protocols. Barber lied last time I went in about the price of the haircut. Cash only but they won't tell you that. The barbers talk about really inappropriate topics and don't care about the people getting haircuts. Barbers also text while giving haircuts. Please be more professional.<//review>

1st time here,  Levit was super cool reminded me of my son lol. I got a fade and a shave. He took his time to make sure I was satisfied.  Would definitely go back. And observing the other barber's they all cut pretty tight too.< /Text>

The shop was clean and large. There were 3 hairstylist working. My guy wore his mask properly as did I.
The other two guys did not wear their mask over their noses and part of the time did not cover their mouth either. Their two customers wore NO masks.   There was another person in the shop and though he was twenty feet away from me, he also wore no mask. I voiced my discomfort to my hairstylist but he said nothing to the other two hairstylists.
Mr. Scissors lack of following Covid-19 protocols for opening up is troubling. I won't go there again.< /Text>

<review>I went in not knowing what I wanted, but the barber discussed it with me and proposed an idea that I liked. He was very fast and precise and as he proceeded he checked with me on how I was feeling about it. We agreed that it would be better to go even shorter than initially proposed. The result was perhaps the finest short haircut I have ever had. The price was remarkably reasonable considering the quality. I did not have to wait as I went in during the mid-afternoon although they did indicate that appointments are recommended if one should desire a short wait time.</review>< user>

<name>David Doblan<//name><Text>Highly recommend - I Needed a cut after six months and booked my appointment with Dragos. This guy is not your average hairstylist or barber; he is an artist with excellent communication and execution. Dragos will ask you what you want and will make suggestions based on his experience from cutting hair around the world. He's studied different forms of hair design, and it shows. He has a wealth of knowledge and truly knows his craft. See you in three weeks, Dragos!< /Text>< Rate>

<text>This place is very clean and even has arcade games. Brandon Coe has my barber and he did such an amazing job with my hair (a lot of cow-licks) - I will not be using anyone else to cut my hair as long as Brandon’s there! Very professional, quick, and friendly (no forced conversation).

Took the time to make sure my (mixed ethnically) hair was well blended. Comparable price to other quality babershops in the LA area. I think they offer more honestly in terms of service with their beard dying, eyebrow clean ups ect.
Only Downside The online appointment app didn't work. The wait wasn't terrible. Clean place everyone was nice a friendly. Would definitely recommend to others.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Awful service. I went in for a cut on my lunch hour, 2pm on a Monday. The shop was empty except for the three guys running it. They asked if I could wait while one of them finished his lunch in front of me. And I guess I could chat with the other two? No thanks. Walked down to 18/8 by Gelsons and they were friendly.< /Text>< GmapID>

<user_name>Robert Taylor</user_name><date>1594955775798</date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>The Orange County Orthopedic Group only wants your INSURANCE $.  They misdiagnosed my wife who was experiencing lower back pain and stated, "we will do everything to avoid surgery."  This created insurance billing for over 2 month with unhelpful shots (10 in one visit) which resulted in to paralysis in her leg.  The chiropractic procedures DO NOTHING and are non responsive.  They herd you into the office(waited 1.5hrs for a scheduled appointment) and push you out with no relief all for insurance billing.  Avoid these doctors at all cost.  They will try to move you through their network of partnering Dr's in order to continue billing your insurance "Oh see a nerve Dr., I have someone I can recommend he's expecting you." Or, "I guess you'll have to see a Spine Surgeon now, oh I have someone I can recommend, he's expecting you."  Really...?  Initially Dr. Vyas you advised that surgery would be the last result.  Oh, I get it.  3 months of insurance billing and paralysis now push you on to the next.....Crooks.....!</review>< pictures>

<Text>I have been a patient at Dr Vayas office since June 2020 . Very professional office. Dr Vayas and his team are great. The team makes you feel comfortable and are very attentive and helpful. I am so glad I found this office. Dr Vayas has exceeded my expectations. This is truly a great team of medical professionals.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd1d4c125a9f9:0xc5d9cfbb610f2a65</gmapID><Date>1602264822771<//Date></record>

"Dr." Vyas misdiagnosed cancer with muscle spasm and injected cortisol.  Later an intern in UCI diagnosed cancer the second he saw the x ray.  The license of this so called Dr should be revoked for the sake of people.  I called his office several times but he preferred to ignore.  Hopefully,  I'll see him in court.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcd1d4c125a9f9:0xc5d9cfbb610f2a65<//GmapID></record>

Extremely friendly and professional office.
Dr Vyas was thorough, patient and accurate with his dianosis.
Therefore his reccomendation was solid.
This medical experience has been the best that I have had in a number of years.  Get here if you can.</Review>

<Review>Usually I do not write reviews for the Doctors particularly for the doctors with super specialists unless something terrible or abnormal things happen.
My Mother-in law, who is 85 Years old, lives with us in Corona. She is healthy and fit to her age and does the routine walking workouts as a ritual. On Dec 6 2018, she completed her morning routine walk and after a bath started complaining about pain her ankle.
Such a sudden swelling and complaint for pain would lead you to believe the sprain or muscle twitching. My younger son, who is into his internal medicine residency, started icing and keep foot elevated to alleviate the pain. Her pain and swelling subsided but not to a great extent.
We decided to consult nearby ortho but being last day of the week no appointment was available. I am patient with Dr Shail Vyas and contacted his office to see if he can accommodate in his busy schedule. We were there right at 4.30 PM just before closing hours of his office.
Dr Shail Vyas asked few questions after physical exam like whether she had a Fever or duration of the pain and other complaints and recommended to have x ray to rule out any bone or muscle issues. But even before getting X rays he opined that it seems something abnormal like infection. I was just starring at him wondering how in the world sudden traumatic swelling has to do with infection????
After getting X rays, he started elaborating on his observation and opinion----It is a staph infection slowly spreading to the body, you need to get a tissue culture, blood screening and MRI and your next stop should be in your area community hospital ER.
He gave us a note describing all of these recommendations and advised to show it to the attending doctor at the hospital ER.
Attending doctor at the hospital ER room, just looked at the ankle and glanced at the note. In a very sarcastic and apprehensive tone he opined that it could a gout or minor hair line crack and why these super specialists would get to a conclusion even without a blood test? After a long wait, Blood work, MRI and haggling 8 hours after her admission attending doctor admitted that it is a staph infection and we must follow the procedure prescribed by Dr Vyas!!!
My mother in-law was diagnosed with staph infection and had to undergo surgery on emergency basis as infection was spreading fast due to weak immune system. She is still undergoing wound care treatment at home.
I cannot imagine if Dr vyas would not have advised us to go to ER as our next stop. I wish majority of doctors and specialist doctors would have such acumen and professional integrity.

Here my experience is contrary to my belief and encouraged me to write a honest review.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd1d4c125a9f9:0xc5d9cfbb610f2a65< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

The food is absolutely delicious, the only thing that sucks is the public bathroom is too close to the dining area and it kills your appetite. I would recommend to order takeout and thoroughly enjoy the good food< /review>

<Text>This is a wonderful, small, branch of the Sac. County Libraries. I waited a long "pandemic year" for it to re-open. Only allowed one hour on a PC and a maximum visit of only two hours. Tuesday thru Saturday open from 10Am to 6Pm. Facemask required. Out of 14 PC's only 3 are available with social distancing. A decent collection of DVDs to checkout.(not nearly as many as the Folsom Library though) They used to have all the periodicals, magazines, and newspapers that mattered but haven't seen any since the re-opening. Hope they'll extend time allowed soon, not much to be done with only one hour of computer or electrical outlet to recharge. Super friendly staff but all different from who'd been there for years before pandemic.</Text>< Rating>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This Bibliotheca, is great. There actually are a large number of things to do for young people in the area to do. Tons of room to learn or study quitely in silence.
In addition to the loads of writings, there are other types of resources to aid you research or get your tasks completed. Printing solutions are offered, along with easy computers connected to the web.

Browse, print, or send out e-mails. With a range of within your reaches, there is plenty for you to get into right here. Just about every neighborhood needs to have such a valuable and lovely resource readily available to individuals who live there. It is an embarassment that as a result of lack of unique financing, several are required to cutback, or fold. Make sure you promote your public library as much as you can, as these important resouces need all they can get, and are going away at a rapid pace.

When I was a child, I would certainly invest hrs on end, studying, playing, as well as studying. The improvement of modern technologies has actually permitted us to execute several activities convenitely in our residences, however there are still many actions you can not due without your local library. Most individuals will not miss them till they are gone, but once they are gone, it's almost impossible to get them back. Cherrish your library and battle to keep its pressence in your city. Support your public library.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809ae7835e3461e7:0x833ecfd7ca916a2c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you ever need something to read. RC public library is a good option. Good selection of choices, and computer access if needed, also very helpful staff. Convenient location. 5 star worthy? Check!</text>

My kids love going to story time but the last two weeks the library has been closed, at least it has on Wednesday's. Once for scheduled maintenance, one not. Going to have to start calling before getting my kids excited only to be disappointed.< /text>

<Text>I'm giving this library a very poor rating because I felt discriminated against & not assisted. Almost every time my son tries to play on the kids touch screen computer, they tell us he is not allowed to clime the chair and touch the screen. Instead of trying to compensate for his shortness they told me I wasn't slowed to move the screen closer to the chair for him to be able to touch the screen standing up. I called the district lady and never heard back. Just because my son is short does not mean he should not be allowed to play with the equipment that's meant for his age group...<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ae7835e3461e7:0x833ecfd7ca916a2c< /gmapID></record>

This is coming from a girl who can consume ~20 400-500 paged books within 1 or 2 weeks. I CRAVE teen books, and thankfully they have a huge teen section. But they also have a good kids section, as well as a nice adult and research section. All the liberarians are welcoming and accomidating. There is a comfortable seating section, and plenty of computers free to use. The atmosphere is calming and peaceful. Even though there are people talking, it is a pleseant aura.<//review>< Date>

Great place to spend time with kids. If you get a chance to go to a booksale, you could fill a grocery paper bag full of very interesting books for a ver cheap price! Enjoy reading!< /Review>

We went to story time for the first time today and attended the Yisrael garden, he's very knowledgable about gardening and he's really good with the kids. All the kids were so engaged and curious and learned new facts and maybe peaked more interest and an appreciation for our fruits and vegetables. This library is great for kids all ages.</Review>< username>

The rating for this location WOULD have been much better because the sales department was great. However, I waited for a month to receive my spare key and eventually just had to go in and then they had to schedule a service and come back to get the key paired with my car. That's not a big deal but now my car has been making weird noises like something is loose. I brought the car in yesterday and it's still there. My frustration is that this is a brand new 2021 Honda civic and thus far I have had a negative experience with Honda. I wish it could be more positive because, like I said, the employees are all super helpful.<//Text>

< Review>
Had my civic serviced at the Honda dealership closer to my house and realized afterwards that something was hanging underneath my car. Took it in here and they replaced the missing clip and I was on my way. I was expecting to wait a few hours since I came in without an appointment, but they got it done in 30 minutes. If I lived in Temecula I’d be coming back here for all my services. Very helpful and understanding of my little predicament.<//Review>

<text>Went in for an oil change on 3/2/21 and the service man came back and said my back brakes need to be changed right away. I didn’t have a good feeling so I said no. Went somewhere Else to get second opinion and the second opinion said my brakes where fine.  Disappointed with a dishonesty.</text><user_id>111428807842035581810</user_id>< Name>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I took a 100 month warranty battery and honda did not honor the pro-rated life warranty of the battery stating that because I did not have the original receipt of the battery they could not honor the warranty, the battery only had 60 months of use, never the less, I could not get the prorated 30% of the remaining 40 month.
I am dissapointed in the way that the service department handled this issue.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I blasted this place the first two visits I  made here. This very recent visit I made with them was totally a big turn around with their service. They must have changed the management here. This guy Daniel really took very good care of me. They even called me later to inform me that they'll adjust my service charge because apparently they forgot to credit my lifetime free oil change. Kudos to the great service improvement!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My husband and I entered the dealership and neither of the managers greeted us or said a single word. We had our vehicles appraised to trade in and was given $7,000 below kelly blue book value.  We were not taken seriously and felt stereotypes as if we couldn’t afford the vehicles there.  We decided to leave and will never set foot inside of that establishment again.  I do not recommend this place at all.  Left feeling disturbed.< /Review>

< review>
So in September of 2019 I went to get my very first car and I had no co-signer to help me and I was working a lot trying to save up. I came in and talked with Cece and he helped me out with a game plan on how to improve my credit score and how much down payment would be good for me to save and he gave me a good guild line on how to not ruin myself financially at a young age because at that time I was only 19. I followed all of his advice and a few days ago I walked in and had an appointment with cece again this time my credit was better and I had more for a down payment and he remembered me and got to helping me right away. Cece and a gentleman named Matthew helped me find the right car and walked me through my first ever car purchase. With this covid-19 stuff going on I had lost my previous job and just started working at a hospital but I didn’t get my first paycheck yet so I had no proof of income but they didn’t stop. Cece, Matthew, and a gentleman named Corbin from the finance team helped me rework the loan and made sure I got the best deal possible for my financial state. I must say with all the horror stories I have always been told about car dealers and salesman I was very worried and the only reason why I trusted Cece was because I knew he was a prior marine like my dad (semperfi). However I will always send them business and go back to them when I need any help. With the world shutting down and everything else these guys helped a very misinformed kid make the biggest purchase of his life yet and they walked me through everything. The first time I went in Cece flat out told me I could sell you the car but it would hurt you financially in the long run and I don’t want to do that and that alone should tell you what kind of dealership this is. These people inform their clients and help them they don’t screw  them over Just to earn a buck. Definitely made my first car purchase something I will never regret so I highly recommend these guys hands down the best people to go to for a car purchase. Also not only did they work tirelessly in the middle of a pandemic and a heat wave to help me but they also gave me advice on how to pay off the car sooner and how to refinance my loan in about 6 months to a year. These guys care about the people they help and it shows they earned my trust and business for life</review>

It took 2 hours for an oil change and tire rotation - with an appointment.  On a previous visit it took over 1 hr to replace a defective battery they sold me - I also had an appointment for this visit.<//Text>

Update 8/8/20

This place is nothing but a bunch of crooks.  They do NOT honor their own warranty and dodge every attempt to get them to do the right thing.  I would steer clear of this place and their crooked antics at all costs.

<text>I was looking to purchase another firearm. Specially, I was looking to purchase an LWRCI. I had been looking around for a while and came across Guns Direct. I live in Bakersfield, so it was going to be a bit of a drive. I’m also a Trucker, so I knew I wouldn’t be able to make it same day. I emailed Guns Direct and asked if they could hold one for me. They were extremely friendly and said they’d be happy to hold it for me. I showed up next day and was assisted promptly by Melanie and Nix. Every person in this shop was courteous and friendly to both my wife and I. They offered us to view any additional firearms we may be interested in. Customer Service is a big deal to me and my wife, and we were blown away by how awesome everyone is here. They made us feel welcomed and as one of the “Family”. I would recommend anyone looking to purchase a firearm to come here. They now have two customers for life!! I don’t mind the travel to purchase my firearms here. So, if you’re looking to purchase a new firearm, look no further than “Guns Direct”!!<//text><userid>105333071555337091380<//userid>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>What you need to know about Guns Direct is that they genuinely care about their customers!

I have purchased three firearms from them and the most recent one was for a very specific purpose. I was excited to get exactly what I wanted and have always found the shop to be very friendly and accommodating despite how busy the shop always is. What happened next was such a disappointment.

I picked up my new pistol, took it to the range, and straight out of the box the thing failed!  I took it back to GD and the owner personally helped me identify the problem was the ammunition. Although I was not convinced the ammo was the problem, I appreciated the personal attention and promise that he, the owner, would personally make the situation right no matter what steps were necessary. Awesome.

I addressed the ammo issue and headed back to the range. The gun failed. On my next trip to Guns Direct, Mike, the manager assisted me. He spent a lot of time deeply invested in problem-solving for me. I had already gotten prepaid shipping labels from Smith and Wesson. I was prepared to send my pistol away and be without it for up to 2 months for a problem that was not my fault. But, the guys at Guns Direct went above and beyond to save me from any headaches.

Mike held on to my pistol with a plan to deal with S&W for me or communicate with DOJ to learn about a return if they could not get my gun to work. At 10:30 that night, 4 and half hours after the shop closed, I got a call from the range where the owner and manager had fixed and fired my pistol. The owner himself took the striker assembly out of his personal protection piece and installed it in my pistol. I have since ordered a brand new S&W assembly but am able to now enjoy my new pistol only because the guys at Guns Direct thought leaving me hanging was beneath their standards!

When you buy a firearm, you want a purchasing partner who will have your back. You can never go wrong with Guns Direct because when you spend with them you're never alone. Excellent Service. Highly recommended.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4yNX2Bm5H5_uQFClYkWE3-DHr2USqiibtkldG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Really friendly and knowledgeable sales people. And they have a fairly consistent flow of popular items every week. Got me a Kel-tech Sub-2000 9mm for $200 less than another popular store. Also no appointments needed, so I got there at opening time and had no lines and just walked in and made my purchase.</text>

Never purchased a weapon before. This was my first time walking in to even look at a weapon. They took their time showed me my options and then took me through the steps to purchase my weapon. After the ten day wait period I went to pick up my weapon. I asked if he could give me some safety tips. But what he gave me was a course right in store about gun safety,  how to hold my weapon, what type of ammunition I should use and some legalities behind the ammunition. I got way more than expected and felt that I had left with some powerful knowledge about my weapon and its safety features. I will definitely come back and show my support.</Text>

This place is overpriced. Everything they have is over 150-200 dollars,
I went to buy a gun which they advertised for 699.00 and after paperwork was done they told me it is 799.00 and didnt even tell sorry we made a mistake. Ended up canceling the purchase. Same gun in Turners is 649.00 and much better service.</review>

<Resp>{'time': 1621013639276, 'text': "Good Morning Vardan, we're very sorry you had a bad experience at our store but you need to understand something. We're not a cooperate chain like Turners. They have contracts and buy in bulk so they can keep their prices a lot lower than small businesses. In fact you even asked for many discounts while looking at guns, asking over $200 off for some higher end firearms. We would lose money on that kind of deal. We're sorry that its hard for a small business to compete with chain corporation shop prices.\n\nAs for the customer service and price issues you mentioned, we had two employees clearly explain the mistake (The tag was for the SP2022 without Night Sights and you wanted the one with Night Sights that was $100 more) and apologize several times, however you ignored them off and walked out. You cant complain online that we we're rude and didn't apologize when you clearly didn't respect us enough to hear our explanation and apologies.\n\n-\nGD Management"}< /Resp></record>

<Text>This place is awesome. Best service I've ever had anywhere.  Melanie was super nice, gave me a good deal, and was helpful. Everyone here was mad kind and knows their stuff. Even if other shops had better deals I wouldn't care this place has won me over and I won't be going anywhere else. Thank  you guys so much and I will be seeing you in the future for some upgrades. Im a first time gun owner btw. Didn't know anything and this place was more than welcoming.<//Text><pics>None</pics><username>Carlos Cordova</username>< gmap_id>

Every time I have come to this store, I have received the best customer service you could ask for. Even in the times we are in right now, they are striving to bring in the things people are looking for most. Whether you are just browsing or shopping, they will help you to their utmost ability. No discrimination between the experienced owner or the first time buyer.</text>

<text>I became a first time Gun owner here at this shop, and let me tell you, these guys are as cool as a spring breeze. Everybody had great attitudes, super helpful, as organized as could be with a crowd. I was greeted at the door by James and co-assisted by Liz. Super professional. I'll definitely come back!<//text>< pictures>

People at Guns Direct are by no means less than stellar! They will go far and beyond customer service and it seems like it's their second nature. Everyone in this store has been consistently courteous, friendly and professional. Props to James, Mike and Daniel.< /Review>

<text>Look, if you're in the market for a gun today (COVID-19 times), you're gonna have to get in line.  You'll have to wait.  Gun shops are gonna be slow to respond.  They're busy.  Ammo is hard to find too.  Now while none of them is perfect, there are a few out there who do at least try and be responsive and treat you with some degree of respect.  Guns Direct in Burbank is such a place.

Nowadays inventory is tight everywhere, but these guys do the best to keep you up to date on their social channels.  There's typically a line, but the wait is rarely horrible.  I've had to wait a lot longer at other shops with supposed appointments.

As for what ultimately made me wanna spread the word about how good these guys are, I'll tell you.  They had a piece posted to their social I'd been trying to get for a while.  I contacted them via email and they got back to me within a couple hours and were able to set it aside for me to purchase without long wait and undo hassle.  There's not nearly enough of that in California nowadays.

If you're looking for a shop that'll take care of you, has great stock, and great service, look no further.  You literally can't do better.  Believe me, I've tried.< /text>< date>

Best. Service. Ever!! Found this place half by accident, but it is the best kept secret in Burbank. The staff are all friendly, helpful and they really care about their customers. None of that grumpy store clerk stuff I've found elsewhere; these are all real enthusiasts and it shows. My go to store now, even if it is an hour's drive from home. Thanks GD!!<//review>

This is the best place to go! Couldn’t be any happier with the service. They were extremely helpful, informative and professional. Of 5 shops I went to they were the only ones not price gauging. Highly recommend! Thanks guys!< /text>

First time buyer here, i visited all the shops on magnolia just before the Stay-at-home order went into effect and these guys were the most respectful and answered my questions every time. Show them respect and they'll show it back, and impart all the knowledge they have onto you so you can be the most responsible gun owner you can be. I must have come by 3-4 times between getting on line and actually making the purchase, and coming by to pick up today, and every time I came by, all my questions were answered with no disdain (as some shops have had towards first time buyers lately), and they even kindly gave me a rundown of all safety features and loading/safe unloading of the pistol.

Can't wait to make my next purchase here, will be back soon!< /text>

Service is decent. I understand were doing social distancing. But for a pick up, being told 15 min only to wait 2 hours just makes one feel played... Main gripe was pricing. I get it. Everyone is out to buy a firearm but i was gouged. A pistol that was not priced ANYWHERE for more than $400, was 579.99 here.<//Text>

<text>A friend recommended Guns Direct to me for my first gun purchase. I found a hard to find 45acp Glock 30 SF at an Indoor Range in Santa Clara. Guns Direct worked with them to transfer the gun to Los Angeles. Their website and staff walked me through the first purchase paperwork and background check flawlessly. People in the store are very friendly, and were patient  with all of my questions. If there is a gun 'cult', these guys don't show it - as a total newbie to this, they really treated me like gold.<//text>< Date>

<Review>In the midst of a global pandemic and civil unrest, I was one of the many looking to purchase a new handgun.

Guns Direct has a simple solution for making a appointment (Made mine for the following day)

Mike the sales guy was direct and straightforward forward about my request for a Glock 19 letting me know there was a shortage and it was unknown when it would arrive. But I could purchase the gun now to be fulfilled at a later date which would be completely unknown. Honestly was expecting 6-8 weeks.

The following week I was sent a text that my firearm had come in and asked when I could come do the paperwork, so I made a appointment for later that afternoon

Liz took care of all the paperwork and showed me how to tear down the firearm all while I was there.

Now I just need to wait on the State of CA DOJ to complete my paperwork before I head back to pick it up. Which unfortunately will without a doubt take longer than the first steps in this process.

Thanks again guys you were great<//Review>< pics>

First gun buying experience couldn't have been more easier, quicker, and convenient. Staff defined courteous service, especially "Man of Steel" aka Superman. A superhero amongst the shadows who makes sure your right as a gun owner are saved. A customer for life. Period.</Review>

In a time of civil unrest, the employees at Guns Direct were calm, collected, friendly and knowledgeable. It can get tiresome with the influx of gun sales sky rocketing in this uncertain time, and peace of mind is essential; but the employees at Guns Direct had patience. Thank you for helping in my purchases today. I highly recommend setting up an appointment with Guns Direct, masking up, and abiding by the CDC’s safety outlines while exercising your free right as an American. This process took under 40 min, and my sales representative was very helpful and knowledgeable. The DOJ’s lag time to get background checks in a timely fashion (10 days) has been overwhelming in a lot of ways, but in no way is that the fault of Gun shops. They’re on your side! They couldn’t see my smile under the mask covering, but I was leaving very happy with my hassle free experience and I look forward to giving them business in the future. Stay safe and healthy! Cooler heads prevail!</text>

I see now why this store has such a high rating.  I just completed a private party transfer through Guns Direct and the entire experience was a pleasure.  Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable are the best adjectives I know to describe the staff.  Definitely hope to find a reason to do more business there (and I'm 2 hours away).</Text>

<Text>A great shop run by knowledgeable and nice guys. They have great specials on ammo and firearms. I personally like to follow their Instagram page to stay up to date with their specials. They will also work with you if there isn’t a specific special that week to win the business<//Text><date>1553072272976</date>< rating>

<name>Daniel Ingersoll< /name><time>1577736097574< /time><rate>5< /rate><Review>These guys are outright awesome. I live on the west side of LA and my only gun store is overpriced and rude. I have been to Burbank a couple times but only to a competitor down the road. My experience there was subpar. Then, I was doing a PPT with someone and he recommended guns direct. I came for the transaction and my experience was excellent.

PPTs are a necessary burden for FFLs and I hate that it’s such a process for a store and for us. Unfortunately, that’s the state of gun rights in CA. When we came in for the transaction the staff here were completely professional, friendly, and efficient about the whole process. Also, after the transaction, they helped me look at some other inventory and weren’t rushing at all.

I decided to come back here to ship a rifle I was gifting to a family member. To be in compliance it needs to go through an FFL and a lot of stores don’t want to deal with this. It is a hassle and requires a ton of paperwork for the store, along with tracking the item all the way to its destination. It goes on their license and it’s on them if anything happens in transit.

My local FFL in Culver City doesn’t do this at all, and the competitor down the road from Guns Direct wanted $150 to handle it. I asked Guns Direct about it when I did that above mentioned PPT and they said it’s $50 for labor plus shipping costs. That is a good deal for the amount of work it requires them to do and it’s clear they do it to be of service to the community.

That process was also quick and easy and they made the whole process go smoothly. They also again helped my father look at some guns and we purchased some other items as well.

To top off these two positive transactions, their prices are good, they are veteran owned, and the guys who work there are super cool. I highly recommend this shop for any of your FFL needs and I will be traveling the 30-40 minutes each way just because of this.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm a total newbie to guns and currently shopping for a pistol to use for home defense.  I called yesterday to inquire about a gun and spoke to Palmer over the phone about an H&K pistol and the process of purchasing one.  It sounded very busy in the background but WOW!  He was thorough and patient with me and explained all I needed to know over the phone.  Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks when I finally decide on a specific pistol I will definitely head over to Guns Direct to make my purchase.  I highly recommend this business!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c29560d24838d9:0xaccca82ed74c4ecb<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>By far the best place in the Greater LA area. Came in during the rush for black rifles at the end of 2016. By miles the best experience I have ever had in a gun shop. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable, and willing to point me in the right direction. Kept customers updated on charging laws and informed them of deadlines. I will come back to them for any purchases for the rest of my life. Will not consider any other place because of their amazing customer service. If you are looking for a shop to make your purchases in LA I highly recommend you come to Guns Direct. You will want to come back.</Text><user_name>Jimmy Garcia< /user_name>< Date>

Overall: Great communication and fair value

The Good: Called to see if they would accept a PPT for a particularly unique transaction where the item is legal although appears questionable. They did their research and confirmed and everything went off without a hitch.

I arrived here b/c I called Turner's to confirm and when they did over the phone, they changed their mind when they saw the item. Only problem that I've ever had with them although due to the amount of time wasted by all parties, it was a regrettable experience.

Back to Guns Direct, their shelves are full and walls stocked with high quality inventory. There were lots of friendly staff around to help and the entire thing went on in a safe and efficient manner.

The Bad: N/A<//Review>

Had a fantastic experience dealing with Guns Direct. Paperwork process and FFL transfer was fast and easy. Staff was polite, informative, and easy-going. Just listening to a staff member provide earnest advice on a sale to a different customer really gave a great impression. Will certainly be coming back! I don't normally write reviews, but I highly recommend.<//text>

<Review>I was very pleased with the interactions I had with various store employees.  Every single one was courteous, friendly and knowledgeable about what they sell. I called about pricing for a product and what was advertised on the telephone was what was advertised in the store.  The whole purchase process was a breeze also.  I will be back.  Mike was very helpful and a good dude.  Thanks, Guns Direct.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>This store is sick! I am so glad I called this place and asked what they had. I was looking for a very specific Aero Precision lower receiver and they had it in stock as well as MANY others. They also had another rifle that I wanted to buy at the same time so it worked out great. This store stocks as many lower receivers, sets, and rifles as they can get. They have the biggest selection of lower receivers I have ever seen. They also have a huge selection of other products from pistols, to magazines, to cleaning supplies and so much more. I highly recommend this store and I tell everyone about it. Thanks Guns Direct!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I had been looking for a GLOCK 19 3rd Gen since Dec 2015  & after calling several stores I had No Luck until 01/28/2016 when I called GUNS DIRECT. They had 2 on hand and I asked if they can put 1 on hold for me and with no hesitation they said YES!  GUNS DIRECT is a Busy store but SO well staffed. I was greeted when I arrived and 5 min later Phil started helping me out, giving me 100% of his attention.  Phenomenal customer service..!!! Thank You Phil & Thank You GUNS DIRECT!   I Highly recommend GUNS DIRECT!< /text>

Few wrong information were given to me. The guy who handled the paperwork, Chris, didn't know how to work the gun in order to show me the safety demo. He also kept interrupting me when I wanted to talk. Refused to give me a napkin to wipe off my thumb after the thumb print. Will NEVER go back there again mostly for the wrong info given to me.< /Review>

Overheard the bald male Asian employee today being rude and dismissive about a question I had (not the one with the goatee, he's cool). Stay in backroom and out of earshot of PAYING customers if you're going to say something disparaging. Yeah I get it in retail everyone talks bad about the people they serve, just humor us that our business is important in front of our faces and save the pithy comments for the back office where it belongs. On the other hand everyone else was very courteous and friendly. So 1 star for the Asian guy and 5 stars for everyone else.</review>

<Response>{'time': 1431562737052, 'text': 'Vyacheslav, we are very sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your experience here at Guns Direct.  Unfortunately you chose to register a firearm and then back out of the process afterwards.  This requires us to cancel your paperwork with both CA DOJ and BATFE and for that expense we charge a restocking fee of 15% of the entire price of the firearm - a condition that YOU AGREED TO before purchase.  As for your $25 DROS fee, that money went to the state to run your now unnecessary background check and registration paperwork and is NON REFUNDABLE from CA DOJ.  These terms were explained to you in full before purchase and your paperwork has a statement signed by you to that effect.\n\nYou claim that we refused to "negotiate" with you.  Frankly, Vyacheslav, there is nothing to negotiate for or with.  If you had cancelled your purchase with us before your DROS and 4473 paperwork had started we would have gladly refunded your money to you but at the risk of making a bad pun once you pull the trigger on registering a firearm there is no recalling the bullet.  The fees are paid and the work is done.  You were not purchasing a pair of shoes.  You were purchasing a firearm - one of the most heavily regulated and controlled products available for sale.  A product that has to be carefully registered, documented, and reported.  Our employees don\'t work for free and their time is valuable.  Perhaps before your next gun purchase you will put some time and effort into your decision making process.  "Never again visit store?"  Okay by us, sir.\n\n-Palmer, Asst. Manager\nGuns Direct'}<//Response>< Text>
BEWARE! I MIGHT BE ONE OF NOT MANY BUT WITH IMPORTANT VIEW ON THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.
MY REVIEW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT POOR HANDLING OF ITS RETURNING CUSTOMER, WHO DECIDED NOT TO PURCHASE FIREARM AFTER DEPOSIT. INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATE THEY JUST CHARGED $170 IN RESTOCKING FEES!!!! VERY DISSATISFIED.FEEL ROBBED.

I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY NEED TO MAKE MONEY. BUT YOU WOULD MAKE MORE OFF OF ME, CAUSE I WAS PLANNING TO COME BACK IF TREATED WITH UNDERSTANDING AND PURCHASE IT AND OTHERS LATER.
NEVER AGAIN I VISIT THIS STORE.< /Text>

<Review>Everyone's so friendly, just picked up my m&p sport II. The environment feels safe and we'll maintained and I'll definitely go back there for something else soon. They have some good prices on munitions and it might always seem crowded but they are all experienced and the que moves very fast. They're very knowledgeable about gun laws and gun laws to be. They're always well stocked but call ahead. I called about a colt 10 days ago and they had one but it sold in the 20 minutes it took for me to get there. This should definitely be in your top choices of gun stores.<//Review>< resp>

Very helpful to new gun owners. They talk to you with respect and a non judgmental or patronizing tone. Each of my visits have felt personal and welcoming<//review>

Awesome, took my permit test 3 days ago and they were really cool about helping me enter the world of shootin'. I was given the test by a really nice lady, whos name I forgot (sorry). My friend Kurt works here and recommended me to go here. I got to say i was very intimidated by it all, but seeing just how all these people were happy and friendly here made my day just that much better and easier. THANKS GUNS DIRECT I'LL BE BACK SOON!!!! :)< /Review>

<Text>I walked in a while ago, and the gentlemen behind the counter were sincere, and informative to my questions about obtaining my liscence to purchase firearms and about transferring ownership.

When I'm ready to buy a gun from a dealer here in CA, I'll first come here to see what my purchasing options are. I just really wish they'd put their inventory on their website so I didn't have to make a trip (I'd really like to make a comparative study on business prices so I don't have to drive everywhere). Not sure if I'm being ignorant to state laws that state they can't do this...

Look forward to visiting your shop though again regardless because of the respectful behavior of your employees!<//Text><user>110430807179071662891< /user><gmap_id>0x80c29560d24838d9:0xaccca82ed74c4ecb</gmap_id></record>

The selection is good as well. The prices are a bit on the high side but still reasonable and much better than Gun World down the street. The overall service is superior to Gun World where they act like you're bothering them. This is the way a gun store should be run and is a pleasure to do business with. Also, PPT fees are $25 compared to $55 plus $20 lock at Gun World. Take my advise, I've bought from both.</review>< rate>

Great selection of assault rifles. Reasonably priced, was looking for true Russian ak-47 parts and they actually specially got them for me!! perfect! Not very easy to get stuff like that in the U.S. The full Russian ak's complete...thats another story, but I don't need to worry about that part ;) Thanks again!!<//Text>

I don’t expect this review to do much but I just hope anybody that is new to real steel gun community sees this. I'm sure that nice people work there, but the one specific guy behind the counter (husky, with glasses, beard, and a bad attitude) is the person im talking about. Im 20 and transitioning from airsoft milsim to real steel. I don’t know much about real steel guns. So hoping I could walk in check out the store and give them my business I run into a person with no customer service skills. He talks loudly making it clear I dont know anything  ( I never said I did I was hoping to learn more about it). When asking for the price still being rude and thinking I cant afford it (well think again). Im not incompetent I know these aren’t toys. I have my firearms saftey permit I didn’t expect to just walk in and buy a gun. I know the process. Aside from that all I can say is this is one of the last things we have in this country that guarantees our freedom. Yet people like this guy are making damn sure that the newer generation don’t want to get anywhere near it. Its a good thing I got thick skin and still going to proceed into learning more about my right to bear arms. I know every one has their days so im just going to assume thats not his every day personality.< /review>

When I went into the Outdoorsman (next door to where I buy my petfood) I and asked a general question about getting a license I was met with annoyance that I even came in to ask -- so this was a really nice change.  I actually chose to come here because of all of the fantastic reviews!

If it weren't for how expensive the gun was that we purchased, I'm already ready to go back now and get another.

<review>My wife is LEO and has been needing a new off-duty gun. We were at Ham Radio Outlet next door (my guilty pleasure) when we decided to check out Guns Direct. Not only did they have the Ruger LCP in stock (nobody has them in Bakersfield, where we are from) but the price was good, the service was stellar, and they knocked out the DROS faster than I have ever had one done. Guns Direct is awesome.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c29560d24838d9:0xaccca82ed74c4ecb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Bought my first handgun from these guys, and I have to say the experience was excellent. I cannot fault their customer service. The pistol I wanted was out of stock at the time, so Kyle, who I dealt with throughout the process, ordered one for me, initially he said it would be about a week, but it took a little while longer, but at all times I was kept up to speed with the situation. Also, my DROS application was a little more involved, and this also posed no problem, especially as another gun store had told me I could not purchase a handgun! I did some research of my own, contacted both the D.o.J, and the BATF, found what I needed, Kyle said no problem, and a short while later, completed the D.R.O.S., and 10 days later, picked up my Springfield, one very happy camper! Sure, I may have been able to get it a little cheaper elsewhere from a chain store, but I was happy to support a small, family owned store, who have always been more than helpful on every occasion I have been in there! I would highly recommend them, and I will certainly buy from them again!</Review>< Date>

I went in looking for a gunsmith.  Unfortunately, they don't offer this service.  None the less the staff took a look at my shotgun gave me advice and then (and most importantly) pointed me in the direction of a nearby gunsmith that could properly appraise my firearm.  Very friendly environment.< /text>

Friendly staff and prices are fair. No bs to get lower in and out in 15 minutes compared to Turner's where you'll wait 2 hours for the same thing and non friendly staff.</review>

Good place but they need to really enforce their rules for online pick-up. Horrible to see people getting out their car and with no mask to talk to the employees instead of checking in and end up getting their order before the people waiting that have been there a while checked in. Why have rules posted if you're not going to enforce it with the customers. You need to keep your employees safe. Especially if they're standing next to the employee while loading the groceries. Might as well load it themselves and stay away from the employee.</text>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>I love the convenience of shopping online for groceries and just picking them up by going to the back of the store, pull in a pickup parking lot and having the groceries laded in the back of my SUV. I probably appreciate it more than most because it is so painful to walk around any store t shop. But I  believe it is one of the best options for anyone with or without any disabilities. Try it you're bound to appreciate the time savings. Thank you very much Walmart!</Review></record></dataset><record>

There are so many people shopping at this particular Walmart that it is kind of a hassle to shop there. Employees on the floor wear a "Don't bother me expression" on their face constantly.
Cashiers are bit more friendly.< /Text>

It's amazing that they are open so late, but they keep changing the location of items and it's annoying to have to find things.
1. Great fruit and veggie assortment
2. I like the arts n crafts area
3. They have a nice selection of seasonal stuff!< /Review>

The store itself was fine but, being a nurse I have an issue with their covid entering the store procedure for customers to enter. Why would you have people to walk all the way across to one side then walk back across to the other side to enter. So, they take their germs in a pattern of a backwards "7", across the parking lot, then the front of the store...just not good control of the germ drop offs. There's no good reason to walk along the front of the store, other than extra steps.
Other than that the staff of the health & beauty care station is amazing very helpful and friendly<//Review>

<text>Walmart is a Walmart. Nothing special or different. Has a big parking .. so easy to park, enough space inside for lot of people.

Online ordering and pick up works pretty well. And they mostly have things available .< /text>< userid>

It's affordable, place is clean. There's usually a line to get in on weekends but the wait is only a few minutes. There's sanitizer at the door for your convenience. Inside you can get McDonald's and prescription glasses.<//Text>

Fine Walmart location. I’m disappointed to see they’re not even trying to sanitize carts anymore you just have to find one in the parking lot and disinfect it on your way in. Doesn’t seem like they’re paying much attention to maximum capacity either (though not sure they ever did). The pandemic isn’t over people!<//Review>

<review>The clerk was helpful know what he was saying and I was in and out with 15 min's walking and out. I think it was just old day's in 70s when people know the hell they knew. In days you cant get a clerk to show up. And if you do they don't know the hell that we asked.so. 5 star for wal-mart💓</review>< gmapID>

<Text>has everything a shopping market might have including a garden section, bike section, toy section, paint section, car section. Simply put it’s a huge Walmart with more than just standard groceries. Wait in the lines is not too bad but can sometimes get to be somewhat lengthy depending on how many boxes are open. Most of the time the only boxes open are self checkout.</Text><user_name>GodofwarMCR UwU</user_name><date>1616564245472</date><Gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8</Gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>It's so confusing to find anything in this store. Stuff isn't grouped together properly and all over the place. Would be good to do some user experience walk throughs.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8</Gmap_id>< Resp>

<text>Prices are right, absolutely! No matter what though, this location is always really, really busy as it is in a busy part of town. So, as long as you can deal with crowds and lines, go for it.< /text><gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8<//gmap_id>< pictures>

On 06/05/2021 we came to collect our shopping. It was the first time we ordered shopping on line in Walmart and we had some problem using the app. Mr Tahar helped us and was so nice and accommodating that we left grateful and encouraged. Thank you Walmart for Mr Tahar and making our experience so pleasant.</Text>

<review>Great Wal-mart prices are what this store is famous for and this location is no exception.  I am always surprised at how they have such a great assortment of items and they are almost all ways in stock.  If you need gift ideas, the aisles of  Wal-Mar will surely do. Don't worry about parking it is plentiful.< /review>< resp>

The “customer service” department people leave several hours before the advertised store closing time, so that you can’t return or exchange a defective product after 8pm.  There isn’t even anyone to answer the phone in the evening, so it’s not like you can even find that out without driving over in person.  Who manages this region?  Pathetic.< /Review>

Well i'm from out of town so layout is different. It was close to closing and they wanted people to check out as soon as possible so I got the few things i really needed. I was pleasantly surprised it was so inexpensive< /review>

<review>Parking is good with handicapped parking up front. Long route to get in if you park on far right having to follow path from left to entrance only on right. Pretty crowded and people were masked but not very respectful of social distancing. Lines were very long at checkouts and plenty of registers were closed making long lines at a very busy time. Lady at bike isle was not helpful at all never asking if we needed help but made it clear to not touch merchandise on pallets. Store showed several signs of needing better management during our visit on a Sunday afternoon. No hand sanitizer at exit. Not good!< /review>< Rate>

It's a pretty nice Walmart with many departments. It does tend to get way too crowded (even now with the Covid restrictions) and some products aren't of the best quality. That being said, it's a decent store.</Text>

I remember when this location was converted to a Super Walmart and I couldn't wait.  It is a good one and does well to keep you from driving to Gilroy unless you're just up for a drive.

It can get crowded here and with the aisles seemingly small.  Compared to others I've been to, there are areas inside that can give a closed in tight feel.

As rated, it's not bad.  I recommend going in as early as possible and know exactly where you need to go.<//Text>

Very clean and well maintained. Entry and exit are from different gates. They let people in based on total permitted capacity. Billing counter was sanitized after each customer. Produce was fresh and good.</review>

Due to the stricter covid restrictions I assumed I had to stand in line once again. Shortly after I got my place in line the parking lot security guy pulled up and told us to use the back entrance (by the customer service desk). No line. Which made my experience a lot better. Also, probably not the best idea to go on Christmas eve. The store was packed with shoppers. But the employees were kicking butt. No line at the registers either. Keep up the good work. Know you are appreciated.</review>

Parking in a handicap spot is worthless at this store since I had to walk a long distance to get back to my car since the door I parked at was only the entrance.

<Text>I went to return something but the customer service agents were a little rude. She wanted the exact bar code which was scanned and she suspected that I might be returning a different product. Later turned out the system for some reason logged a different bar code on the comforter that I'm returning and is matching with the system. She wasn't even caring to help me out unfolding or finding the other bar code. She was like I just need the exact bar code which is on the receipt which was way too harsh.<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>Walmart itself was fine they were doing everything to keep the self's full but the people were rude and I thought they were going to buy even the selfs6. People these times are becoming the animals
Myself being disabled though about getting one of there carts to ride around and do my shopping,  I looted at the people that were using them they S plushy as the reset
So anyone that see this, you think your king and if your. It's long time it this o er so get yourself a deal job.  Don't let your life end over a cupcake. Just what would they say on that grave stone. Play and be nice
It over before the game started. Good night< /Review>< rating>

Lots of Christmas decorations and gift ideas👍👍👍👍
Cashier Daniel in the electronics department was super helpful and courteous.
Awesome customer service Mr Daniel!!👍👍
Walmart is and will be one of my favorite places to shop.
This store in particular is always stocked and organized so a big plus ➕👍
Found some chocolates for Christmas gifts😊< /Text>

<review>Encountered a new employee that didn't understand English well & didn't know a couple procedures so had to call for a manager 2x. Rude door monitor asked me if I had a disability cuz I forgot my wallet and came in the exit to pay for my groceries. I was really taken back by that comment and reported both to CS for better coaching.< /review>< GmapID>

<text>It's an okay place. They have covid guidelines in place before entering the store. For a supercenter it lacks other necessary things and most times the shelves are not stocked up. I prefer going to the neighborhood Walmarts. Dont need all that other things. Just need to shop for groceries and other necessities.</text>< Pics>

Walmart is and will always be where the frugal folk and middle and working classes shop. Their on-line store is improving and their pricing reflects the leverage they can exert on vendors... read cheap. It can get very crowded if you dont know the best times to shop so dont just dash in and expect to dash out. Overall, 4 stars reflects my sense of improvements in key areas, web shopping and customer service.<//Text>

Never seen such a huge walmart ever. It's humongous. We went to get part items for Valentine's day and came out 100% satisfied. They literally have everything and self checkout are faster. Huge parking space as usual. Take your Fitbit if you plan to go lol.<//Text>

Extremely disappointed & upset! Not what I ordered & on top of it it came a week late from delivery date & what was most disappointing was that there was pieces of wood that didn't even match with the dresser my dresser was supposed to be black & I got pink, light brown & dark brown pieces delivered to me....< /Text>

Not a safe place to shop. Mask wearing not enforced once inside the store. Staff are rude, unhelpful, and indifferent. Low prices aren't worth this! Way too many people inside. Floor space is 50% of usual due to pallets and carts littering every aisle of the store making people walk on top of each other to simply get from aisle to aisle. They may list their square footage as a certain number, but that number is half of what is available to actually walk around in. No way to maintain 6 ft separation at this store.

Other Walmart locations are able to follow the county's health rules, I don't know why this one can't seem to figure out what every other store has figured out.</review>

<review>Store is huge as all Supercenters are. Very busy...parking lot was full but found a spot in Siberia 😊 Store was well stocked with constant replenishment occurring.
I was navigating using store aisle info. Great if the aisle info was at ceiling level also. Store map shows aisle location but hard to orient yourself.</review>< Pictures>

The line to go inside due to COVID is far too long. I have tried going into the store about 4 different times and each time is was going to take over 20-30 minutes just to get into the store.<//Review>

<text>Big store full on grocery store plus the normal Wal-Mart stuff. This store seems to always have a clearance row. Plenty of parking and easy to get in and out of the parking lot vs the Wal-Mart on Almaden. That stores access is horrible one way in and one way out.</text>< UserId.>

<Review>No so much of a good experience as I was doing a return. The cashier was rude and was inquiring multiple times  why was I returning the items and why  I did not return the Christmas lights before to what I said multiple times: there is nothing wrong with the items I just couldn't make it back to the store before .... She was just not getting it😖😖 ... until I said " I was really sick and isolated for 3 weeks !!" Well I just  didn't think was necessary for disclosure my personal health problems in order to do a a simple  return.  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️< /Review><name>Lily Lopez</name><userid>115307677552105444223</userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

I understand for expensive items but for 1$ lube is it worth making your client wait for over 10 minutes. Definitely won't be buying here again. No Walmart in the nation does this except for expensive things.</Review><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

Its my first visit to another supercentre of Walmart located in San Jose. It is much much better than the one located in milipitas in order of store size and variety of different items. Store was neat and clean. Rest of things are as same as in other supercentres of walmart like availability of Halal chicken, bakery, fresh produce and deli. The thing which may bother you little is that the enterence, exit and car parking lot and is not well lit.<//text>

Best bargain prices. Definitely not fun if you hate crowds tho! Safety protocols for COVID-19 good. A short wait in line during  peak hours as only 380 or so are allowed in store at a time but line moves quickly. Staff friendly, helpful. Could use a few more clerks at checkout. Overall not a bad experience for such a large store.< /Text>

Decided to go to Walmart after a long time of not going. They have one door on one side of the parking lot as entrance only and the other end of the BIG parking lot as an exit but you have to walk ALL ACROSS the parking lot to the exit side only to walk all the way back to the entrance side.  Only for the security man to shout at me rudely when I had no idea I had to walk to the exit to walk to the entrance because it makes no sense. Unorganized attempt at social distancing...Not to mention they have long lines and a few cashiers and no Apple Pay or any contactless payment method. Just reminded me why I haven't shopped there in years! I prefer Target they have as good prices and great pickup/delivery. Walmart service has gone downhill significantly.</text>

It is a a nice store with huge variety.  Today my visit was even remarkable because I saw a person who was creating stuff using leaves. Here are some of his work.</review>

Never order online. If you don't receive your order, the refund and/or replacement process is far more difficult than any other I have had to deal with< /Review>

They really should have an app that shows you which aisle to find the items you're looking for. Like Ikea's app.
Also the ppl in the store really don't know anything. 3 people sent us to 3 different spots all far away from each other for one item. Not one offered to come and find it with us.<//text>

I am shocked how Walmart provides a superior curbside pick up during the Pandemic (Covid). They made it so easy for people to order and pick up without contact. The ordering process seamless and easy. I had no issue using the app the first time and have been using to place order weekly. What I impressed most about it that you tell that you are on the way. Drive your car to the pick up location. Once you are at the pickup location. Use the app to tell the warehouse staff where you park (designated pick up parking spot) and what color of your car. It was so easy. You confirm your name without opening the car window. They loaded the food and you can go on your way. That's simple. I am so thankful to Walmart for making it so convenient for us.
Here is why I am giving Walmart a 5 stars.
* It is like shopping at Safeway
* it has lots of grocery items
* fruits are in a good quality
* lots of variety of meat products
* love their vegetables selection. I never had an issue with running out on the vegetables.
* never run out of my milk, cheese, eggs and yogurt.
* price is so much cheaper.
You can me a Walmart shopper now and you know what, I am a Walmart smart shopper.... Thank you Walmart. You Rock!!!</Review>

Was looking for a specific product for my cat - a laxative. I did not find it in the pet department so I asked someone working there and they quickly disregarded me and directed me towards pharmacy. When I went to pharmacy I found no one behind the counter and no one on the floor. I approached someone in an adjacent department to see if they could direct me to someone who could help me in pharmacy. All she could say was that everyone in pharmacy is on lunch. She kept repeating that when I tried to get further information. I decided to go to the customer service center. as I was in line I witnessed a couple arguing with one of the floor managers about returning something very loudly in front of the customer service window. When I approached the person behind the counter she was sniffing and talking rather quickly. I don't usually shop at Walmart and I don't think that I ever want to again because of my experience in the store. Wow, Walmart you've reached a new low...</Text>

Huge lines to get in. Better to avoid altogether and shop online. Other than that, super sized walmart with everything you imagine it’d have. Crowded and you do get “that” type of walmart shoppers!<//Review>

<text>Understand that Covid has changed a lot of protocols and the luxury of entering and exiting from either the left or the right side has changed. They should put a sign out front "one way in, one way out." I part in the last aisle to the right of Walmart. I entered through the entrance to the right. Walked to the left side of the store to cash my check. Walked to the right and tried to exit but was denied and I had to walk to the left side of the store to exit. Then walk to the right of the store to get to my car. I lost count how many times I crossed Walmart to just cash my check. Wear your walking shoes when visiting Walmart.

Did not help AT ALL, seemed annoyed with my questions, definitely will not be using Walmart when other places don't complain at me for asking questions. He was literally just there to say they didn't have items in stock and DID NOT help find a suitable replacement item. Just sitting and collecting a check. I wish they would hire me to do that.<//review>< pics>

Ordered it's online for in store pick up. Got email saying items delayed. Check online for their inventory and it says it's in stock. Call the store multiple times only to get hung up on.

Finally drive to store which is 25 miles away from me. (only store that has the grill I want)
I see all the items I want in store and buy it. Their online order and store pick up is trash.

In store they are polite and friendly. So they got that going for them.< /Text>

My relationship with Walmart Super Center is personal. I was one of many employees who built and opened this store July 2004. This is the place where I learned the important aspects of running small and giant retail business. So, when I come in to shop I will observe the behavior of each associate. If notice that they are having difficulty performing their position,  I support them from the outside. This store is a source of pride to me because I believed in Sam Walton's practical ideology. It's my store.<//review>

The online store said there was the toy I was looking for in stock at this location, but there was none on the shelf. It's not just a single toy either, so I would have suggest that if you see an only-in-store item online, it's probably not worth your time to come here. They are probably too busy to update their inventory correctly and may trick you to come to the store by saying the item is only in store.

However, if you're coming here to shop regularly, the amount of inventory they have is huge. You can get lots of things here.< /Review>

This Walmart has been pretty well stocked throughout the pandemic. Generally I have not had to wait more than a minute to get in. You walk through the queue, grab a sanitized cart, shop, pay, and then come out the exit on the other end. There are arrows on the floor to get people to walk in one direction down each aisle, but a lot of people don't pay attention to them.</review>

Its a Walmart. Cleaner than some others, kind of busy but still a good selection of things. Halloween decorations are a bit lacking though.</text>

<text>Called to see if they had an item in stock in the Christmas Holiday section. Couldnt even hear the woman on the phone cause you can hear the radio chatter really loudly as well. Anyhow, I was asking if she could check an item number. She told me that I am better off coming in instead. So I asked her if she could just look it up in the computer. She said they dont have a system to check anything. So instead of arguing, I said "ok, thank you"......I got no courtesy welcome or apology for not being able to help......I got hung up on. I felt that was a bit rude, especially from a customer service associate. Wish I had gotten her name...smh.</text>< date>

< review>
Their customer service is really untrained rude to everyone you basically have to find a specific employee to find what you want and to request something out the window cabinet is a milestone if you get a staff member right away your blessed lol but 'walmart has everything you might need for great deals they can and are better than Amazon tell you the truth just this store needs improvement</review>

<date>1606438397647<//date><Review>Better then the avg Wal-Mart visit staff was genuinely courtious & actually going out of their way to assist every customer within eye and earshot sometimes before the customer even knew they needed assistance.  Maybe its because of the holiday I don't know but you know something special happened because every customer in line was smiling laughing, or just patently waiting and the store was at COVID Capacity which for most stores means stress on the customers,stress on the department employees that rolls to the managers ,customers becime frustrated and are unable to clearley explain what they want curther stressing out employees mabagers this combined with long lines stressing out cashiers WELL YOU GET THE IDEA!!!BUT NOT THIS STAFF
On the ball not a lazy employee on the floor everyone on point eliminating the snowball effect and creating an enjoyable last minute stressful family coming over hope everything is perfect pre- thanksgiving day shopping experience.
OH YEAH all this and they still have to make sure everything is black friday ready.
Thank you wal-mart .

If you're picking up groceries for contactless delivery, the back of the store is where you need to go unlike other Walmarts that have these zones in the front parking lot area. having it at the back of the store makes this one a whole lot easier and much more convenient to get to since you don't have to deal with regular customer traffic.<//Review>

It is another walmart. They don't pay their employees very much, and that's what you get. They are not bad nor lazy, they just aren't the best.< /Review>

< Review>
The doctor told me that my medical insurance was no good for optometry
Also her next appointment wasn't until September 30 at 12. So if I don't find another optometrists who accept medical I have to pay 65 dollars out of pocket.< /Review>

Ordered items online and came to pickup. You need to pay attention on the orange pickup sign. Once you notice the sign, you shuld be routed to the back of the building.

You also need to pay attention again to find the sign on the wall for each parking lot.

The phone number on the sign is useless, no one will pick up the phone and the voice mail box is full.

You can only put down the window and wait someone to ask your order number. Or you can install Walmart App and use it to check in. Note: you need to install before you come, the signal here is bad. So you won't be able to install the App or may need more time to download the App.< /review>

We went to the Super Walmart on story Rd. You do have to wear mask. The carts are sanitized as you take it. You also have to walk from the exit outside the building to the entrance there was no line for us. I have 2 total replacement knees and I am going to replace both hips soon. I bring this up for those with similar handicap issues. The store had no toilet paper, but plenty of paper towels, good selection of summer clothing. The frozen food aisles very well stocked. The store is missing a few things, but overall very well stocked. It is clean and the employees are kind and helpful. The bakery very good! Worth the trip to buy items.<//Text>

Walmart has a lot of everyday uses there like food and etc. But this place is a perfect store to go to if you are looking for multiple things like food to electronics. If you don't want to waste your gas to go to multiple stores to get stuff go to Walmart.</Text>

It was an unremarkable experience. Nothing out of the ordinary happened, nothing particularly special. Staff were relatively polite, one even asked 'Could I take your platter sir' which I appreciated. However, one member of faculty didn't even care to look me in the eye when I asked how they were -DISGUSTING! Overall though, not bad but I probably will not return, instead opting for the Target established in 2014 next to Chick-Fil-A. Thank you, and goodnight. Follow me on twitter @bhafcdan.</Review>

Once we figured out where to go (around the back of the building) we called the number and was told to leave a message. However the mailbox was full. After a few minutes someone asked if we were there to pickup an order. The attendant took the order number and went find our order. After 15 minutes he came back and said he couldn't find our order. He then asked for the order number again and this time he found it. The whole experience took longer than it should have. The attendants were confused who was with what order. None of the attendants were wearing their facemasks correctly and none of them wore gloves!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This area has gotten really bad in parking and there are too many ppls the line is very long... the front of the store is so dirty management needs to have the place cleaned up... the deals are good for food and household items<//text>

Your regular Walmart with good stock, OK service, a little slow employees, and a little messy display, which makes it almost impossible to find something listed as in store only.< /Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Walmart- Little Saigon in east San Jose, is not a great store it's overcrowded, it doesn't have enough employees to get items. Especially if you need something that are locked behind glass cabinets. the employees, are  lazy and don't want to help you. I observes two female employees. tell my mother  the eye drops are over there. what is over there? isn't it  their job to assist  a customer. especially a senior citizen being confused and really needing help.  that's why I'm giving Walmart East San Jose 3 points, because the customer service is poor.</Review>< pictures>

For the most part the staff is polite and helpful when they understand what your asking  for " word of advise speak slowly and make eye contact use visuals when you can." The store is usually well stocked. But if you don't know what your looking for exactly you will have a time of it. Also if you need something that's locked up have patience because it's gonna be a minute while they find the person with the keys< /Text>

Everything was locked in cabinets which I understand if you have a lot of theft...but. I pressed the help button button for over 20 minutes at two different cases and no one ever came to help. So I left my cart and walked out.<//review>

You can find just about anything you could ever want but not always the version you want. Could you buy a laptop here, sure, but it won't have the power you want. Want that new video game? Sure, but so many people go to walmart they probably beat you to it. Wide variety of the most popular foods but probably won't have that weird specific thing your wife is craving late at night when you have nowhere else to... sorry let me get back on track. Still, walmart's low prices, variety, and relatively helpful customer service (they can't always help but they usually try) are a great thing to have when you live in one of the most expensive cities in America. They almost make it possible to survive.< /review>

Management must be excellent to have such wonderful employees as Lori and not only Lori but every employee I came in contact with had a smile on their face. Nice to see a store so well stocked and clean.. Five Flags 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Great Job<//Text>< Pictures>

Worst customer service, they didn't allow my kid to try bike before buying and most of the stuff on display were not available in racks. Not properly organized in terms of signages or items in aisle. I left few items that I picked up in frustration.<//Review>

Cheapest prices. Not the cleanest store. But stocks almost everything. Use the pickup option for convenient shopping.</Text>

<Review>Well typically Walmart is a pleasant experience but as of late with all the C0VID-19 stuff going on, it's been somewhat of a disappointment. I was looking to buy a mountain bike. The store was pretty much cleared of all bikes yet they left tags on the racks in which the bikes would be placed upon new shipment. I had to take a picture of the skew in order to even look up the price I had to ask SIX different workers even  see if the bike was available at another store... It wasn't. Honestly I'm not dissatisfied with the store being out of stock due to the special circumstances but, I am dissatisfied with the lack of customer service and laziness of the employees.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8</gmap_id><username>Buster Jordan<//username>< rating>

The service it's horrible, I order a toy and they said they have it In stock and ready to pick it up same day, after that they don't till next 3 days, then nothing until next week,  after a week I cancel the order.. Hopefully was only me... No more Walmart on line.. Waste money and time..<//text>

<Review>The worst part aout this Walgreens location is all of the homeless people when you walk in. I know that this is somewhat outside of the stores control but it would still be nice to not get hassled when you walk in. The store itself has a good selection, but the best part is the pharmacists – Very helpful and professional. The bad part is cashing out up front. The line can get so long that it wraps into the candy aisle. More cashiers please!!!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5qbfdk0DTPGHwFDiS8TMTsM1eAm3OpGOo2gXq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv5PQGuy_lmGM9V5eeQ5ETKPFP39Yb4iCP-S70=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8<//Gmap_id></record>

Staff is always friendly and eager to help but often when checking out the registers malfunction and you have to wait a while before you get help because multiple machines are going down at the same time and it appears only to be one person that can fix the malfunctions<//Text>

<Text>I drove all around 3 cities looking for a specific type of product that was said to be in stock at many locations, though it wasn't. Finally, after going to this store and maybe 3 employees later i found "JAYE". She completely went above and beyond to look for the item at this store. It couldn't be found here so she contacted several other local stores (without my knowledge) in hopes of helping me find what i needed. She was such a sweet person and we were really thankful that she went out of her way to find my item and have the store hold it for me. I can not say enough about this young lady's amazing dedication to her work and effort in customer service. I don't believe another employee would have given me better service or really make as big an effort as she did. I'm very pleased with her, did i mention that?? 😁👏 Bravo to her and who ever was smart enough to hire her. I will be calling the store manager to advise them what an amazing employee she is!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

If I could give a NEGATIVE rating, I would give it a -5 stars. Customer service is a joke at this particular store. I waited for more than 30 minutes for someone to come to the pharmacy area, alongside other customers, some elderly, some with disabilities. NO one showed up, I gave up and went to pay for the other items. At self checkout. Tried to speak to the store manager, Edgar P. Who never came, Assistant mgr came to the front, as a couple of us were waiting. Her excuse was that they were having issues with the keys and were working on it. But NO one came to explain that. She offered to go back to the pharmacy area and see what she could do. I asked her if she had keys, her response was NO!!
At this point I told her, "what good is it going to do with no keys" and just walked out!!
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</Review>

I've been waiting patiently to get a key made. The came, saw me, left and didn't come back. I called the store while in the store, they paged for and guess what? I'm still waiting after 15min after they paged. Store sucks with service!</text>

They have more first aids products than any other regular farmacy and the cheapest prices. The only uncomfortable thing is that you have to wait for assistant to get them for you. But still it worthed.</Review>

<Text>Very dissapoiting.  They started locking up stuffs such that cost around $1 such as dental floss behind cases and you have to find a clerk with the key to unlock the case for the items that you want to purchase.  As if clerks are not busy enough!   I believe there is a Target nearby.  You will have to pay a little more but most  merchandises are more organized and not locked behind cases so you do not have to look.for a clerk and get out faster.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>This place is ALWAYS super crowded..you need to be there at opening time 6a.m. and people will still be there. Just not as much. The merchandise is locked up....yep locked up. Try finding the attendant with the key is a job. I rather go elsewhere due to I don't have the patience nor energy to be in there all day. You got to walk a mile to find something. I never use to wear tennis shoes but I do now when I go there. Its always changing...get use to something in one place next week its moved. Variety is sketchy....some things are not there but at other stores. It's cluttered as well. I don't like going there.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is ALWAYS super crowded..you need to be there at opening time 6a.m. and people will still be there. Just not as much. The merchandise is locked up....yep locked up. Try finding the attendant with the key is a job. I rather go elsewhere due to I don't have the patience nor energy to be in there all day. You got to walk a mile to find something. I never use to wear tennis shoes but I do now when I go there. Its always changing...get use to something in one place next week its moved. Variety is sketchy....some things are not there but at other stores. It's cluttered as well. I don't like going there.<//Text>< pictures>

Ive been going to this walmart for almost all my life and what i have noticed is that this walmart has most necessary things youll need. Besides that its not so bad its easy to go around. Employees are sometimes lazy. The walmart is not the cleanest. But its a walmart over all its not so bad.<//review>

<Text>You'd think you were in a gun store, what with everything behind glass, locked away. With The Jungle being so close, I get it; but they should also realize they need more than one key holder to open the displays in the entire store.

Lines can get long, especially with 3 associates standing around at self checkout, I stead of opening a register to help get people out.

Do not come here after 5, unless you want to deal with crowds.<//Text>< rate>

Now this place looks like a playground no good just for kids mothers don't say anything to there kids and the employees just wounding around and you ask an employee where something is an when they can't speak English they don't know where anything is not a good place to go I stop going there for a while sometimes I'll stop by see if there's any improvement but nothing just getting worse< /Review>

I was looking online for some headliner screws and found that WalMart did in deed carry them. I went out to the closes store and after trying to find them with the help of 4 different sales people, I was told it may be an online only item. Hmm, they could have mentioned that on the website. That would have saved me so much time. Are they doing that now? Haven't seen any evidence of that yet the last couple of times I've been looking for other items.</Review>

Super Walmart is huge store I love to go there, but it's too far away. I needed a pair of glasses but they fell apart. Overall, I haven't had any problems at Walmart. Yes, the prices are good but you have to watch what you buy because let's face it some items need to be quality and last a long time.< /text>

Went to return online item. Long line with one worker doing returns. She needed help because her register was frozen. She called out to colleAgues and supervisor for “key” and was ignored. My Walmart bag had the order # and the worker manually imputed the # and when it did not work, she said it was not the order #. I showed email confirmation with the same order #. She tried again and it worked this time. She must have mistyped. Total time in line was 30 minutes!!!< /review>

Deals here are pretty much unbeatable but there's always too many people here which you can avoid by doing pickup and preordering if you would like to just pickup and go which is why they get five stores<//Review>

Super Walmart is huge store I love to go there, but it's too far away. I needed a pair of glasses but they fell apart. Overall, I haven't had any problems at Walmart. Yes, the prices are good but you have to watch what you buy because let's face it some items need to be quality and last a long time.<//text>

crowded and hard to find assistance.  needed to buy some eye drops and after 15 min waiting for help and got out empty-handed....cause no one showed up! pressed the call button and no one took the call either!  FYI,  3-star rating is for the spacious parking area!<//Text>

It was a huge store.  I liked that it had a true garden center including an outside nursery.  Also, the cosmetic area where they have everything under lock and key is enclosed by shelving and was staffed by 2 employees.  You didn't have to go looking for, or press a button, to find assistance.<//Text>

There are so many workers stocking shelves and chatting around , they never smile they speak in their own language and they're very rude, I mean they're not already there are some nice ones but they ask you to move out of their way as if they're more important than you all of the aisles are filled with boxes and carts that are for stocking purposes. It's just a horrible place to shop if you can avoid it go elsewhere<//review>

Awful. Everything is under lock and key. Lines at self checkout are long. Lines at at cashier checkout are longer. This could probably be alleviated by cutting the Chit chat. Stocking during peak hours is nonsense.< /text>

< Review>
This Walmart is just okay because they don't carry the full line of Olay body lotions and body washes I wish they would carry all the lines of Olay. Also when i go to buy shampoo and conditioner or Astro Glide Wett Wett they are always sold out. I am Transgender American and Astro Glide is the only thing keeping me feeling like a "Real Woman" you feel me tho. Astro glide water based saved my life. Thank you so much Walmart God bless you.<//Review>

If your looking for something that starts with the letter (A-Z), then they have it!  If they don't, then it's out of stock, on backorder,  or you are looking in the wrong place!  The only issue would be that it's not the cleanest store in town.  On the upside, their prices can't be beat, and the tamales that customers sell in the  parking lot are delicious!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I'm definitely going to have to give this store a 10 or 5 stars? Not because I have relatives that work there. But the store is Huge, by the time you get to the frozen section from the front, your gonna need another cart. And thank God their prices are low, so don't be afraid of the extra cart!</text>< Pictures>

I've not been in a Walmart for years and I have to say they've improved. The stock was sectionalised nicely with labelled shelving and even an app that can help you find what you want. That said products that should be next to each other are not. The pies we got from the bakery were ok but not amazing. It did take a while to get through the checkout even though plenty of them were open. Its a busy store. This one has accessible rest rooms.<//Review>

The parking lot is always crazy ghetto. But I like the family restroom in the back of the store instead of the one in the front of the store. The make up, shaving products, etc is a separate area that you pay for separately and it always is packed. The men's socks and underwear is also locked up.< /text>

Was on the self check out, and one of my items did not have bar code (frozen Burrito). The cashier that was there kept insisting that they have to have one,finally she got up and to her surprise it didn't have one. So she said they couldn't be sold. Instead of saying let me bave someone go and get some with a bar code!!!! I was so upset because i was in line and as i walked out and left i realized that i forgot to pick up the $40 i had ask for. Been trying to call Walmart and when finally some answers I'm on hold for 17mins and no manager is grabbing my call. I can hear the staff 3times telling her(manager) that i am on the phone.  Very frustrated.... I guess i made someone very this Christmas. And I am out $40😟< /review>

<Text>The worst Walmart I've ever been to. And that's saying a lot. I travel for a living and have been to 46 states. We had to wait 15 minutes for them to unlock the case the deodorant was in then another 5 minutes for them to get a different person to come and unlock the case for the razors. I can't believe that everything is locked up and they don't have a working system to help you. We will never go back to this Walmart!</Text><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

< Review>
I love wal-mart! Just some of the staff.. Maybe he was new?? He had keys to the automotive batteries so I don't know if he was knew or not. But I asked him for electrical tape and the duct tape since I was in the hardware section. He told me to go to the office section. I'm pretty sure that duct tape and electrical tape are not kept in the office section. I went to go look anyways and all I found was Scotch tape. I found another lady in the office section who told me know they're over there in the hardware and showed me right where they were thanks to her I actually found what I needed. Then she told me that the other guy must have been new.. who knows?</Review>

I'm definitely going to have to give this store a 10 or 5 stars? Not because I have relatives that work there. But the store is Huge, by the time you get to the frozen section from the front, your gonna need another cart. And thank God their prices are low, so don't be afraid of the extra cart!< /text>

< review>
Walmart always has what i need and then some! I seem to go for a couple items and always walk out with at least one basket full. It's always busy and hard to find help, so go when you in a good mood, your not hungry, and dont have a bunch of little kids throwing fits. It has good prices and a good selection of merchandise. That's why it's so busy. I wont be Christmas shopping there, only because of the crowds. Great prices on gifts i suppose. Go early or stay home. The stores look like a tornado went thru them by the end of the day! Feel sorry for the employees having to deal with the mess!! They couldnt pay me enough to deal with that Christmas crowd!!<//review>

<Text>What i love about Walmart Supercenter is that there's a huge variety of products, not only for groceries but also for other kind of needs, like bathroom, kitchen, etc. You can pretty much find all you're looking for at Walmart. Too bad there are not that many Supercenters and instead there are plenty of Walmart neighborhood markets which offer a limited amount of products and not precisely best quality< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Used to hate coming to this store because it was such a mess. Wasn't too bad today. I do hate how they have even the deodorant locked up and no one around to open the case. That's why I'm giving it only 2 stars.</Text>

The buttons to get things out of the locked up cases never get answered and I always end up leaving and buying things elsewhere. Half the time the buttons are broken but there's no sign so you end up standing around waiting for someone to help you. Today I stood at customer service for 5 minutes while an associate worked right next to me before I finally asked if she was going to help me. Ended up customer service counter was closed, but apparently she didnt have the consideration to tell me. Was going to let me stand there for a half an hour. I'm going to have to start driving to another Walmart because I just can't come back here anymore.< /Text><date>1576341182972<//date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Busy - very busy. Staff is helpful and store is clean.

It can be hard to get in and out of the parking lot with the way the lights on Story Road/Lucretia Ave are setup.   So you may want to pick another store or the secondary entrance/exit.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Walmart usually always great as far as prices and things like that but I wish they wouldn't stock during the day that's sort of gets in the way of your shopping and they definitely need to open more registers and have more cashiers on hand cuz there's always usually more than eight people in a line and sometimes only two lanes open out of all those cash registers< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Neat ,clean but the bathrooms are always messy ... Every single time never fails that when a cashier seems to open they never call the second costumer in line I'm not speaking for all but some do , these people including the manager need to work on their costumer service....oh and the loads of merchandise in the middle of the way I would hate to be in that store if there was ever a fire..... but either then that things here are relatively easy to find.....</review>

<review>Parking lot is covered in trash and shady people are looking at you when you park, make sure to have your valuables in the truck and not on the seats. Legos and kids knee/elbow pads are locked up. Just avoid this Walmart if you have better shopping options or order online for a quick pickup.<//review><name>Dustin Whidden</name>< date>

I am a big Wal-Mart fan, but this store needs to fire its entire management staff and start over.  If you go to this location, many items are locked in glass cabinets.  Not expensive items, but cheap $1 and $2 items.  The toothpaste isle has more items in locked cases than the Smithsonian.  I had to find an employee to unlock a cheap trekking pole.  You would have thought it was the Hope Diamond.

Another issue-  the ice cream freezer was not working.  Many containers were covered in frost and ice.  This causes ice crystals which will ruin the ice cream.  This is one of the more profitable sections of the store.  It should receive basic maintenance.

Finally, if the homeless and shoplifters are a problem, then have security remove them from the property.  Don’t let criminals take over your store and ruin the customer experience.<//review>

<review>Horrible customer service! We asked for an empty box from the cashier in Electronic dept and she refused to let us have it... when I asked why, she said simply no, she was getting ready to break it down!! Rude!! Will never shop there again and making sure all my friends and family dont either!!</review>< GmapID>

Ghetto but I like it. I like cheap prices and everything in store. Be prepared that the lines are always long and the service is horrible. If you want to buy anything that people might steal you will have to wait for them to unlock it... even deodorant that was about $1 was locked up! Ugh.<//review>

<review>There is a big issue with the Walmart employees. They give wrong information to the customers. They don't know why they are there.  I went to the money services, they told me we were not able to locate your name on the stimulus check, and we can't cash it for you. They told me this check is not urs it belong to a guy whose name is Donald . lol</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Date>1562652635674<//Date><text>Went to cash out my jar of coins and tried to find a certain type of fish food. One of the employees had no idea what I was talking about. So I finally found it went to the check to get my cash and buy the fish food. A check out lady had the checkout light off but was helping a customer. I assumed she must've forgot to turn it on. So I stood in line. She said she couldn't help me because she was signed out of the register. But I asked how is she signed out if she's ringing up a customer. She said it was in a timer. I call bullcrap on that, (myself working for retail for many years). So I had to wait in a huge line. Two managers were just watching the last check out lady ring the customers up very slowly. And didn't bother offering to help her or open another check out line themselves. I finally get my fish food rung up and hand the lady the cash voucher from the coin star. I'm owed $17.69 and she didn't have small bills. I said I have $3, you can just give me a $20 bill. She said no I ha e to wait for a manager. I said I literally have $3 in my hand. Just take it and give me a $20. She finally got the "complicated" math down and took my change to give me $20. I would say that I'll never shop there again but they're monopolized and have everything I need to buy right then and there instead of waiting for Amazon so I'll just write this review to whom it may concern.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Just an average shopping experience at Walmart. I got one Walmart worker go out her way to help me find an item.  Then I had another worker passing by with a crate be very rude while we were  waiting for the first worker to return from searching for my items. He expected me and my kids to know which way he was going.
He got a little attitude and then turned to another employee and say "some people" . We all heard him so I responded with " next time please clear the path before hand and all you had to do was ask.  I understand it's hot and crowded in the store but it's no excuse.
I thanked the worker that was helping me and told her I appreciate how she went out of her way to us out and left the store.<//Review>

<Review>A store where you’ll find almost everything you need. Electronic store there is big enough to look over some stuff. Usually crowded on the weekends and you may need to wait in a line for half an hour to checkout. In self checkout, you may find big line too. Mane registers for checkout but they do not have enough staff.<//Review></record>

Went there for their garden center and it was much smaller than expected. Many plants not looking very healthy but can find good deals in plant clearance if you want to save some. Please don't drown the plants! Discount the plant according to their status rather than follow a rigid system. The rest of their retail store was pretty well organized. Good prices.</Text>

< Review>
I live down the street from this location. The Walmart I go to is usually Fremont. I like this one but I don't like to go very often to this location because it is always busy and hardly find parking. If you go early in the morning it's better then going in the evenings .staff are friendly and store is clean again depending on the times you go.< /Review>

<text>Very helpful staff. Made sure I got the exact item that I requested.

One employee made sure I got the freshest produce. Using Walmart app to locate the products you need is much easier and accurate than asking for help.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I liked that is was big and I found almost everything I needed. They have Pick Up Tower. Looks really cool but when I order pick up usually tower doesn't work.
Cassiers are very helpful. Managers are nice too.
Waht I don't like it's sad fact that customers leave carts everywhere. Why people don't care? Please be polite and behave like you are living not in the woods, alone and isolated.< /Text><name>Marian Petren< /name><GmapID>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8</GmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< Pics>

<Review>Medicine, deodorant, toothbrushes and basic essentials are locked away. The staff does the best they can but they can only do so much when there is only one or two staff members with key access vs 10- 20 customers waiting in the different sections of the store to be helped. Coorperate needs to consider hiring a staff member for each section that has locked items, we spent over 60 minutes waiting today for different things. We can't blame the staff, there was a bucket load of customers at each section for those team members, we felt so bad for them, one gentleman in particular was literally just running around every where. As a family this was very fustrating as well as it was for many other folks including elderly and folks with disabilities. Coorperate REALLY needa to step it up here. The staff is always helpful tho. Seems like issue is with the higher ups. Maybe they should come on in and work a shift and see first hand the need to have a member assigned to each station who is there specifically and only for that purpose.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

There were some items we wanted were locked, we pressed the button for assistance at one place and no one came even after pressing it twice. We had to go and call someone to open it and person was rude and asked us to wait. At a different isle, again the item we wanted was locked. There was no call for assistance button and no associate was present there.
Really stupid idea to lock stuff when no one is there to open it. I haven't seen this at any other Walmart.
At checkout, they keep every self checkout counter closed. So you have to wait in line even you want to get just one item.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Name>Deepak Anand</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very clean and organized. With a new grocery and deli area it is now an even better shopping experience. I love the butter garlic roasted chicken, it is less than $8 and is family sized, and if you get it cold it is 50% less. Take and bake pizza is less than $9. The bakery makes it's bread right there and it is good. The also have a pharmacy, clothing, toys, optometry, McDonald's and all the housewares, clothes and electronics they are known for. The prices are highly competitive if not the best in almost every category. The parking lot is big, but watch out for bad drivers here. As far as Walmarts go, this one is a good example of a well run one. Recommended.< /Text>< pictures>

Found what I needed at a great price within less than 5 mins. Looked around for a bit and later discovered the bathroom by electronics. There was also a family room. Very clean. Today wasn't too busy. It was a breeze.<//Review>

<text>I like Walmart less and less. The only good thing is the $5 leggings and $1.50 tank tops. Veggies are either too ripe or not ripe enough and their avocados are super small. It's good if you need to get random things but I only go for certain, mostly money/banking type  reasons.< /text><user_name>Christine “Mookie” Miller</user_name>< date>

<pics>None<//pics><review>It's Walmart! Sometimes they have what you need,other times they don't. Lines are long, way too crowded, customer service is unknowledgeable, mostly unpleasant and take a long time. Good luck getting help from any of the employees. My suggestion, go as soon as they open with low expectations and you might get lucky.< /review>< date>

<Text>I like this Walmart because it has a better selection of camping equipment, the other day, I scored a twin pack of 32oz Ozark Trail tumblers for $5. I did the YouTube thing and matched these vs a Yeti, and would you believe the OT did just as good for 1/3 the price. OT hasn't failed me yet AND if it breaks you can still get 6 more for the cost of 1 Yeti. That sounds like a deal to me.<//Text><Response>None</Response><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1519677633900</time><userid>102411492085923355252</userid>< user_name>

<Text>I called this store to get assistance with a transaction done fraudulently 3 times by their associates I got no help the manager was rude. Very nonchalant an told me to call the police she basically confined a crime had happened and said that she would not report it to the authorities that's my job. Walmart makes their own rules and does not care about their customers an the longer they take to fix this issue the more public I will be. I lost nearly 900 dollars an they do not care.

They always have in stock whatever random item I go there for, their employees are friendly and professional and have gone out of their way, above and beyond for their customers. At least they have for me. If I had any issues it was always resolved to my satisfaction. Always a good experience at this Walmart Supercenter.

There were four different places where things fell off the shelves without people touching them I had two shoe racks just fall in my head and now my tooth hurts. The Walmart people are getting ice for me. I hope there's some training around here by the store manager to teach people how to put stuff on shelves< /Review>

I visited Walmart today and as usual it was very crowded. So when I had questions the workers ( I don't know what else to call them) but they were very kind and helpful.
I went to customer service to send money, the lady was very knowledgeable and she was very beautiful.
So thank you Walmart and please get some bags.

Truly your's

<text>I go there all the time I don't have to go anywhere else that is my favorite store the McCarthy Ranch is the best store you can go to very clean organized and they can help you get what you want and there's a grocery store in there too they have quick checkout lines and self service lines to so if you're looking to get in and out McCarthy Ranch Walmart is the best store to go to and it's also the 237 and Calaveras Road plenty of parking there and handicap parking so there's no reason not to go anywhere else< /text>< Pics>

I only give 4 stars because I think cashiers need to improve in speed and also not letting other customers cut the line. Anyhow Walmart Supercenter is a very convenient place to shop with very low prices. I would definetely recommend other people to do grocery shopping here, they will be surprised with the savings.< /Text>< Pictures>

There were four different places where things fell off the shelves without people touching them I had two shoe racks just fall in my head and now my tooth hurts. The Walmart people are getting ice for me. I hope there's some training around here by the store manager to teach people how to put stuff on shelves</text>

<Text>Do not go to this Walmart. I am saving you an Hour of waiting in line. These are the most unprofessional  cashiers I have seen in all my life. I had to wait around half an hour in 1 line then I had to switch lines because the cashier simply just stood there without doing anything. I mean he did try and solve the problem but no one would come and help him, maybe he he was a new employee (?) Overall, come here if you like standing around and wanting to rip your hair out.< /Text>< response>

Very poor customer service. Just not enough staff to help with check outs and the customer service desk as well as watches and jewelry. Had to ask for help with electronics from four different people all who worked at electronics. Usually the employee's are great at for customers who need help but not in this store. Too many young employees working who do not work with pride and respect.< /Review>

< Review>
I visited Walmart today and as usual it was very crowded. So when I had questions the workers ( I don't know what else to call them) but they were very kind and helpful.
I went to customer service to send money, the lady was very knowledgeable and she was very beautiful.
So thank you Walmart and please get some bags.

Truly your's

This place is big and has almost everything you could think off. The challenge is more about finding where what is stored. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of staff around to help and therefore you often end up spending a lot of time running around to find things. On the weekends it gets so busy that it's hard to find parking and get a shopping cart. Their fruit and vegetables is better than most other Walmart. Overall a solid place to do your grocery shopping.< /Text>

<review>this store is very large and kind of feels like a small townso I took advantage of the greeter at the front door and got directions to the men's shoe department and ask specifically if it had a brand that I was looking for which they do. the quality of the merchandise was better than I expected although the
the merchandise was Messy ànd kind of difficult to look through, keep in mind that I was shopping around 10 VB p m. of course this is not a real department store.and no staff were available to assist the shoppers.ultimately I found merchandise similar to what I was looking for. and now I can go online to order throughout my adult life I have been prosperous and have been shopping in department stores that had sales staff. they have a waldbaum grocery store NB that appears to ha good quality and selection as well as a pharmacy.show that assuming you are ready for the deep discount box store experience is a very good store with great selection< /review>< rating>

So I was in here  for an hour shopping, when the fire alarm went off. Most of the employees didn't know what was going on, so they just stood there.  After 5 minutes they started telling customers to leave. That's registers were closed and everyone had to leave. I proceed to leave my cart full of merchandise by the registers, and walk out while they were Still letting customers into the store. While I was walking out the exit, I heard them announce that it was a false alarm . What A WASTE OF TIME!!!!! I didn't even bother to go back! I will not come back ever! This Place is a Joke!!!<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>To be honest, Walmart is a great place to get deals and such, but the downside to the store is organization and reliability. Sometimes, the price tags aren't always correct and it will cost you your time and money. Some products in the store is defective or downright unreliable. Examples: Fake micro sd cards, broken or missing items in box products, and extremely high prices for things that cost less.
If you come here just for some small supplies or food it maybe a great deal, but there are always different option in places  to buy produce.(recommend: Smart&Final, Foodmax, Cardenas, Grocery Outlet)</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8</gmapID></record>

Well I definitely got to tell you I've been to a lot of Walmarts this one was interesting it kind of reminded me of going into American Horror Story looking for food. The staff wasn't friendly and the  place definitely wasn't clean and the parking lot the lights were out very interesting probably wouldn't go there again</Text>

Good for price but terrible for everything else.  Its the super budget store and simply because they don't pay employees a living wage.  You get what you pay for!</Review>

<user_name>Donny Ostrander</user_name><user_id>103251607110957476125<//user_id><review>I'm a street musician who often plays his drum at the Walmart on Story Rd. Walmart used to kick me out as soon as I was seen and/or heard by security. Didn't matter how good I am or that I constantly respected people by my NOT soliciting money from those passing by. Nope. Just put out a hat for tips and played, baby, played. 🎶🎵🎶📻
Now that a Walmart in So. Cal. got sued for their security staff own involvement in the harassing those pan handlers that are often gathering spare change from a sidewalk spot. Cost Walmart somethimg like 5mil. for 6 homeless persons violated rights.🎶🎵🎵
This explains why there is a lot of beggars, (...and one drummer 😎), to greet you when you shop at the Story Rd. Walmart. Please do enjoy your shopping experience while there and I will be trying to bring about a more interesting feel to this place. Thanks for your time spent with your choice to read my opinions today. Bye!🎶♪🎶♫🎵🎵♬🎶♪< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

<Text>Post the remodel it is my go to place for everyday groceries. My only gripe is that the air in the parking lot stinks when the wind is blowing from the landfill. The only is unfortunately down wind from the landfill, so on most evenings it stinks.

Other than that, the place has everything that a Super Walmart needs. The best thing, the employee turn over is very low, I have been seeing the same folks for the last few years, therefore they are very knowledgeable and know where things are.< /Text><user>112774641718984120513<//user><Date>1507478839367< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Heard about this impeach 45 t shirt and related controversy. No t shirt. Employees had not seen it.  Could not find it on website. Looks like a fake issue to me.  Also couldn't find several other things I was looking for a simple blue tooth bud with out wires. Nothing.< /text>

Better selection than most other Walmart. But the pricing is somewhat unclear. Got a storage box that was marked 0.97 but actually came out to be 8.98 at cashier.</Text>

It has everything any other shopping center of this type has(strip mall), and is also especially clean.  A brand new park and the Guadalupe River Trails are nearby.  You can use the trails as alternative routes to make shopping easier  It is easily located near the 280\ 87 interchange just off the 10th St. exit.< /review>

Was here for general shopping.

Best thing is you can get almost everything thing except for most electronics.

It is big, really big😁

One thing is that, the stock is not getting updated very often, especially in the dress material section.
Footwear section is okay I would rate 3/5.
Can find groceries, house holds in ample amounts.

No membership needed, so anyone can go and buy things.<//Review>

< Review>
Overcrowded. This is the only Walmart SUPERCENTER in San Jose and still this one is smaller than most Walmart around the country. And unfortunately as in silicon valley, this might be the first few Walmart to introduce self checkout, the machines are old and slow, don't have a handheld scanner, if you're buying bulky stuff, good luck. Pallets are everywhere, no way the can use a floor cleaner, and combined with large population of the bay, this one is quite dirty. They ran out of carts all the time. It's just sad shopping there, stuff are reasonable priced unlike the W****F*** scam, but just feel like a low life buying there. Hope they can renovate this site soon.</Review>

We had to wait for 1.5 hrs for our online grocery pickup. Workers at the Walmart told us they were unable to find 2 of our totes and refused to simply redo the order for us, insisting that they will find it. After waiting for one hour, we managed to speak to a manager. We were told that the employees never told the manager that there were issues. At this point, the manager told us they should've just redone the order because they lost our prepared order. After another 20 min of waiting for the workers to pick up the items, we finally managed to get our "shopping" done. I would not recommend using the Walmart online grocery service at this location.< /text>

This place is hell on earth and yet it's the most cheapest place to buy groceries. It's hell because once you're about to checkout you'll be stuck in line for half an hour. Just don't go here rarely if you can.

Last time I was here, I was stopped by a lady selling Tamales. Although good, it happens constantly. There is always someone out there soliciting. so much so Walmart now has a sign saying we do not have to acknowledge solicitors outside. It's just... there's a lot of people soliciting.

Inside is good. There's a Mcdonalds and a big food area, but like I said earlier it sucks to checkout regardless if you choose to selfcheckout or speedy checkout. It takes forever to purchase your items and by the time you leave you're already flustered.<//Text>

i called in on tuesday to ask if they had a particular laptop on display so i could get some hands on experience before considering buying.

3-5 of my first calls were on hold for 20+ minutes without reaching an actual person before they were hung up on or dropped.

once i got a live person, they transferred me to electronics where i was on hold for another 15 minutes and then dropped.

after calling another time and EXPLICITLY asking them not to transfer me because it's a really simple question that anyone who can read can answer, they transferred me anyways, where i was put on hold and dropped.

FINALLY, after TWO HOURS, the person who picked up (who was not part of electronics) FINALLY walked over the laptop section and took a look and say no. it took TWO HOURS to get an answer to a simple question that should have been answered in less 10 minutes.< /Text>

<review>I highly recommend going to this particular Walmart, they were really nice!! When I walked in I noticed that there shopping carts were all taken so I asked one of the Walmart ambassadors if they had any around or even just baskets. Right when I asked he stopped doing what he was doing and assisted me right away getting me a shopping cart.

Then I when I was shopping I couldn’t find the can openers so I asked another Walmart ambassador for help finding a can opener. When I asked she told me the location and asked if I’d like her to show me where they were. And I said yes then she stopped doing what she was doing and she walked me over to where they were located.

Overall really great service and really nice staff!! Thank you Walmart Ambassadors.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This store varies from horribly full to slightly full. It depends if they have 6 registers open or 20. Also, they finally have cashiers that aren't seniors who are super slow.<//Review>

Website says closes @ 2:30 am still after multiple complaints but hasn't changed ir 12:30. There's always a long wait @ the registers. Most of the employees are nice, just never have the right information and move @ their own pace unless it's closing time then you're being rushed.</Review>

I bought 6 raspberry plants 2 months ago. 3 grew 3 didn't. I called this morning and asked if I could return the three that never grew and they said yes. I brought the dead plants back in, along with my receipt, but wasn't allowed to return them because I didn't still have the original plastic bags they came in. Extremely disappointed.<//review>

A greater effort from the staff is need in keep the store clean and organized. Often the walkways are cluttered and messy. The shopping carts are in poor condition and the parking lot is littered with garbage, not what I️ would expect from Walmart. It also seems to be understaffed, especially in the grocery department. Store managers seem to not consider suggestions from customers. Prices are good and shelves are generally stocked. I️ really hope Walmart regional management finds a way to rise the bar in this prime location.</review>

<Review>Walmart  has variety of selections for lower prices. What makes consumers go back?  Usually for the lower prices. I decided to come  to this store because I was in the area. Usually, the Walmart I go to is at Milpitas. In comparison, Milpitas Walmart parking lot is cleaner.  This Walmart can use an extra employee to get the carts. But the inside is pretty much the same. It’s clean and the staff is also helpful. I was looking for brownie mix. A Walmart staff walked me to the aisle it was located. That’s pretty helpful.
I did used the restroom, it can be cleaner. I’ve been in worse bathrooms.
Checking out my items was fast because of numerous cashiers available. And the lady who checked my receipt on the way out was friendly too.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Worst Walmart ever. So crowded. Can't even get a face wash without getting an employee to get it out of the glass case. Takes forever to find somebody who can do that. Then you have to go back to cosmetics where they put it in a glass box which can only be removed by the person checking the receipts at the exit. Such a big inconvenience which I don't think is worth it. I will not be returning.< /text>

< Review>
I spoke to four different employees who all stared at me as if I should already know what I'm asking about, and all separately acted like I was incredibly inconveniencing them. It's not like I threw a tantrum over the skincare items being locked in a case, I was totally fine with that. There's signs on the wall which say to press some sort of button, I pressed it, waited about, then after a few minutes asked a stocking employee if I'm doing this correctly. He looks so annoyed as if I interrupted his conversation with the other employee, which I didn't, I just waited. It's also worth noting that the second employee looked at me several times and never alerted the other employee to my presence, or paused her conversation with me waiting there. I'm super polite to retail workers, having worked in retail, and they were all just... So done with me before I had even got there.<//Review>

Typical Walmart where the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing. Clerks don't know the inventory and the store always looks disheveled. And why can't there be more aisles that are15 items or less? Lastly, stop putting the slowest cashiers at the Garden Center register. It backs up quickly and then they get flustered when impatient customers get rude.<//Text>

Post the remodel it is my go to place for everyday groceries. My only gripe is that the air in the parking lot stinks when the wind is blowing from the landfill. The only is unfortunately down wind from the landfill, so on most evenings it stinks.

Other than that, the place has everything that a Super Walmart needs. The best thing, the employee turn over is very low, I have been seeing the same folks for the last few years, therefore they are very knowledgeable and know where things are.< /Text>

It's the closest Wal-Mart to my house. Unfortunately the location is not great. The store is always busy and super crowded. They have over 25 registers but half are only open. If you're planning to make a quick trip be prepared to wait a long time.< /review>

I get the fact that I got there at 11:25 and lines were going to be long and they would be closing relatively soon but have a strategy for shaping the lines. I was standing in line for 15-20 minutes while they closed 2 different lines that a bunch of people were waiting on with no warning. Tell us you're closing the line and show us where to go. Please do better.</text>

I wish I can choose zero.   This was the most     awful Walmart I have ever visited.   The bathrooms were both horribly dirty with all the stalls having feeces and urine all over.   When I spoke to the clerk she said she knows they are trying to get someone to clean it.  Obviously this Walmart has a problem with theft as almost all of their products are locked behind glass.    Won't visit this Walmart again.</Review>

Even though they sometimes lack some great service, anything that you're seeking lays just ahead! They have a large variety of goods, food, clothing, pet needs, fresh produce, fruits and vegetables. There are great beauty products, public restroom, BREAD, and much more!<//text>

This is a large Department Store and Grocery Outlet. A large selection of items at discount pricing. This is a good place to shop.<//review>

<Time>1537482140772< /Time><rate>4</rate><text>I like it much better than one off camden further south, which has no real selection, and no garden center which is odd, considering its placement and exterior I expected more... This one is packed but has most of what I look for at Wal-Mart, if not out of stock. Only trouble is wondering why customer service closes at 8, that isn't even the case in small towns. Missed it 3 times just trying to get there after work hours and in traffic, just life. I wish they would grab another shift in there!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>The cashier checking us out stereotyped my husband and I. My husband was purchasing alcohol while i was bagging items and the cashier asked for both our Id's. Im 23 and my husband is 25 this is the FIRST TIME they've ever asked for both Id's at this Walmart. Now i did not bring my wallet but did happen to have my id, i did refuse first and questioned why she needed to card us both since he is the one purchasing. She said " It's California Law to card both who are together. Especially if you're in your teens you never know who might be purchasing for another" Also let me mention i was wearing an Class of 2019 UC hoodie you'd think she'd be smart enough to take the hint. I proceeded to ask why she didnt do the same for a Father with his teen son who also purchased alcohol a couple people before us and she replied "well that would be different cause i dont think a father would be buying alcohol for his son". That statement with her saying "I dont think" is opinionated and shows how she was stereotyping specifically us. I know for fact that is not California Laws for purchasing alcohol, my niece has worked at Walmart and target before where she was also taught to card only the purchaser. I didnt feel like arguing her "judgement" or fake new law cause it was stupid and a waste of time talking to her. I gave her my ID after it all checked out she proceeded to say " Yeah since you guys are like teens law says i have to card all in the group." Im 23 and my husband is 25 where does the teen come from? I would like to add there's been times where we both would get out from work and would be dressed differently and we got the SAME checker and she NEVER thought to ID both of us. Proves how stereotypical this Walmart is based on appearances.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

One of the best places to go shopping they have pritty much everything you will need. Some employees are vary helpful and others have no idea what their doing. If you know walmart you already know there's always alot of people & sometimes long lines so dont be surprised. They do have selfcheck out a bit faster than waiting in line.</Text>

One of the biggest Walmart I've been into. Lots of parking. Bakery on the right as you enter(next to fresh veggies/fruits). Huge selections.. Only thumbs down I have is the traffic on Story trying to get into the Walmart.< /text>

Place is sketchy at night. Homeless camp. I did not feel safe here. And to top off, Wal-Mart employee argued and grabbed my arm. Store manager made excuses for this employee's behavior.<//Text>
</record></dataset><record>
< text>
I give this Walmart (just a stop along our path to spend the night) a 3-star rating to warn other travelers to be aware of the homeless community living in cars in the corner we parked in.  Most kept to themselves, but one actually went into the store and stole merchandise.  She then came and sat down beside us to avoid the parking lot security.  Four police cars showed up, blocking us from leaving.  One to one and a half hours later, we finally could get out. And be on our way.  Store personnel were friendly, however, we had to wait half an hour even to find out if we could overnight.  Many fast food (Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.) Businesses In the area within walking distance.</text>

<Review>It's a Walmart what are you really going to say about it it's not the worst one I've been in of the best one. It's got food Pharmacy but I was there recently and they had no ice and that a time I thought it might not be too busy the lines are terrible and they kept shutting them down. The self-checkout forget about it there's like the DMV.<//Review>< Pictures>

Bathrooms are always messy and out of soap and  paper towels. Ppl don't bother to wash their hands and they go straight to produce. I know this cause I have been in the bathbath when ppl walk out of the  Bathroom stalls and don't wash after. And I'm at the Produce area and I see them handling the vegetables . That's so nasty. That's why I always carry soup and paper towels with me. It's so important to wash your vegetables b4 putting them away in your fridge.</Text>

Bad service! A store filled with associates and not one of them wants to help their customers. Especially since they started putting things in those locked glass shelves, you'd think they'd have people available to open them.</Text>

Terrible service. I needed spray paint, which is locked in a case. I pressed the button to page an associate at least 20 times over the course of an hour and talked to two associated without keys who said they'd call someone. Heard it multiple times over the PA, but nobody ever came. Went to the one on Almaden and had my spray paint within five minutes of walking into the store. Story's service is awful.< /Review>

Get off your butt and go to the store to see all the great products they have in stock or use the web and get it light speed yes the phone service in very ... ??? But when you are in a 200,000 square footage building and have people standing in front of the person trying to talk on the phone it's hard for that employee to give good phone information what's on the shelf may be gone be fore they can get back.<//Text>

I wanted to purchase a bicycle pump but had to wait 20 minutes while they tracked down the guy with the key to the cabinet where they keep the bicycle stuff locked up ,turns out he was right there but just decided to ignore all attempts to get him to come over to the cabinet and open it.
The rest of my shopping experience was fine.<//text>

<Review>Worst experience ever! I came home and realized that one of my item was charged twice ($23.92), so I called back and ask if this can be solved. The customer service said you need to "bring it back", then I asked "bring back the receipt or everything I bought?" She said, "Yes." I said "But what yes? Receipt or everything?" Then she just hangup and unplugged the phone (not just hangup, but unplug - my following calls did go through). What a great customer service! Gonna complain to the corporate tomorrow.
-------
Follow up：went back to store one week later, they checked their video record and returned my money. In addition, they gave me a $10 gift card for the inconvenience.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Even though they don't carry what I needed the lady really tried her hardest to help me. Their online said they had it but she said it could've been returned, even though she had a bummed foot she still took me over there to see. I can't remember her name her mom works there and her name is Mary and she was just as helpful.</review>

This place has everything but because of its location, it is not a great experience. It's ALWAYS packed and is VERY HOT at the registers when you're waiting in really long lines. Fix your AC.< /review>

<Review>Did not feel safe in the parking lot here at night, even though it was very crowded. Hard to exit. Solicited by multiple people trying to sell cheap jewelry. Next day, tried to pick up an order from online and there was significant confusion. Grocery orders can be delivered to your car, but general merchandise orders could not?< /Review><rating>3< /rating>< Gmap_id>

I always avoid going to this place over a weekend. This place gets very crowded. If you are planning on getting a stock check on an item, good luck - Not all floor associates have a barcode scanner. The good thing is, this place is well stocked.< /review>

This store is so unresponsive. I'm here on aisle L21 trying to get a can of spray paint but I can't get anyone to help me. I've hit the assistance bell 100 times and called the store twice, requesting service. Nothing. Finally I flagged down Linda and she found someone from Toys to help me but he didn't have the right key. Meanwhile my wife has completed our shopping. And your supervisor was completely unhelpful.</review>

<text>It's honestly a great store, i mean, who doesn't shop at Wal-Mart. They have great items, i wouldn't suggest buying tabacoo products here because only one line (13) can sell cigarettes... Which i think they should take a page from WinCo's book and have a whole separate line for the drinks and tabacoo, so people could just come in, get a pack of cigs and dip. Waiting for 5 people with baskets full of stuff when your in a rush and haven't had a cig all day.. Can be kind of irritating.< /text>< pictures>

They Suck in the area of Answering the phone!! Been trying to talk to someone since 10pm but it Rings Ring Ring and Rings!! That's all it does!! So what happens if I go right now & they aren't able to assist me due to the time?  That's why I'm trying to avoid anything that doesn't need to occur but I have crazy hours, dang it, frustrated. Customer Service is a MUST for any business to run smoothly...... This is a Fact!!< /text>

<review>I specifically called before I went there. I was told the woman who could help me was at lunch and would be back in half an hour. So after explain what I needed done I was assured that it could be done by this associate.
I went to the store only to find that the associate returned from lunch and promptly signed out. Her shift was over. I then decided to do some shopping... That was a joke.. It looked like they had a major run on food. The shelves were almost bare.. I spent 20.00 getting to the store and no one was able to yelp me except to say come back tomorrow.<//review>< rating>

<Review>This Walmart gets worse every time I come!! First they lock up the skin care products then they lock up the medicine and allergy pills, are you kidding me? They also put a little button that you can press to “call someone over” but they take like 15 minutes to get there. Also there is always sketchy looking homeless people in front of the store asking you for money and no employee or security does anything about it!! The only thing good about it is that there is more products than the other Walmarts in the area. Unless you need something from here or this is your only choice I don’t recommend it.</Review>< Date>

<text>I went in there on Sun, Nov 1st around 12PM to see if they had any TV Antennas I could use. There was that one store employee working there at the TV Antenna isle, impatiently told me not to open the Antenna boxes. I responded that I wasn't and the boxes were not sealed and if they were, I wouldn't be breaking opened the seals and also I needed to inspect the items inside the boxes if I were to purchase them. At that point,he asked me why I got mad. So I said, If you didn't say nonsenses to me I didn't have to get mad. He looked puzzled and walked away. He didn't look like he wanted to be there in the first place and it was so plain to see. How bad is it going to get Walmart???</text>< Pictures>

Seriously, you are asking why? Wal-Mart is just fine, it's the diverse cornucopia of humanity wearing blankets and bunny slippers, or hauling around their delightful brood of AWESOME screaming miracles of birth. Or eating pizza on aisle 7 while their future ex displays a camel-toe to rival the butt crack of the person next to them. Yes, a trip to Wal-Mart reminds those smart enough that evolution is is full reverse.< /Text>

I don't agree that this Walmart has bad customer service. I believe that they need more employees to service the amount of people that shop here. The employees are helpful and nice when asked too help.< /review>

This Walmart gets worse every time I come!! First they lock up the skin care products then they lock up the medicine and allergy pills, are you kidding me? They also put a little button that you can press to “call someone over” but they take like 15 minutes to get there. Also there is always sketchy looking homeless people in front of the store asking you for money and no employee or security does anything about it!! The only thing good about it is that there is more products than the other Walmarts in the area. Unless you need something from here or this is your only choice I don’t recommend it.</Text>

i loooove the deals they have. mostly everything is cheaper than other stores here. the food i don't trust so much. there are always large crowds of families with their loud and wild children. poor customer service. nobody ever has the time to help you out. and the lines at the registrars are always ridiculously long.< /Text>

It's a Walmart. Enough said. But: Messy, dirty, exasperating, soul crushing, claustrophobic, staffed with mistreated, underpaid zombies. But cheap, relative to other retailers except dollar store (across the street) and online Chinese direct-to-consumer-pseudo-wholesale like Alibaba. With Walmart you get the instant gratification of taking it home right then, and it's open until midnight! Which is awesome if you live nearby like I do.<//Text>

I made the mistake of going there once. It was super crowded and none of the items we had to buy were available. They were sold out. Even if I had found something to buy, the lines were long and the store was humid and crowded. Went straight to the other supercenter that I usually go to, which is also closer to my home. My shopping was completed in less than 30 mins including check out.</Review>

Tried called a few times to check stock on an item before driving over. Heard automated "Thank you for calling Walmart" then it kept ringing. Called 3 times each time waiting for more than a minute. Waited 3 minutes on the last try. No dice. Been there before and their status quo is missy isles, stock out of place, and unfolded clothes mixed around. Guess I'll just go to Target.< /review>

<Text>Usually super crowded which males it tricky attempting to maneuver through the aisles espcially near the toiletry & beauty sections.  I also noticed they carry far fewer products for cosmetics than most Walmartashi.  The plus side is they have a huge parking lot so not an issue finding a spot, the checkout lines are surprisingly fast, and the store is relatively clean espcially considering the mass amount of people who shop there.< /Text>< date>

Tried complaining to manager all I got was I'm sorry, don't be sorry just fix the problem.
And heaven forbid you ask a question and get someone who knows nothing, or doesn't speak English, I'm surprised they have survived this long.

< Review>
Nightmare!  I HATE this store now. Everything is locked up in personal care and cosmetics. Even inexpensive face wash that is less than a few dollars is locked up. So then they keep it behind the counter at the makeup station so you have to buy all your stuff there or you can wait in two lines that are extremely long to buy at the one register  and then your groceries at the other register.
Frequently out of stuff. Extremely crowded.
They do have a good fruit and vegetable selection.< /Review>

Not enough staff at the In-Store Pick Up section, check out, and general staff who could maintain the products at the store. Their policy on In-Store Pick Up is not unify, in fact it is based on the mood of the staffs. If they feel like they want to check your ID for pick-up then they hammer you on it. If they are lazy or easy going then they let you pick up whatever as long as you know your item/shipping# . Super poor management and lack of training.</review>

I am always in awe of these Walmart Supercenters... the sheer amount of stuff they have and the choices they have, I am sure you will find what you are looking for! They carry everything, from Veggies, Fruits, Snacks, Drinks, Clothes, Toys, Tools, Bags, Medicare, Chocolates, Water Bottles, Frozen food, and so much more. If you are in the US and need to quickly shop for your short stay or just looking to do weekly/monthly shopping for your home, this is a great place to do that.</Text>

The employees are rude, and they treat you like you’re going to steal from them. Most of the employees can hardly speak English. When you ask them for help, they act like you owe them.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I went to the store for oatmeal, raisin, vanilla almond milk and walnuts, I found everything I needed except the raisins. I had to walk through the store looking for help and when I finally found help their English was so terrible, they didn't understand me and I didn't understand them, this happened three times, nobody speaks clear English over there. I guess that's how Wal-Mart keeps pricing low, they hire immigrants with little to no speaking English ability. (4) stars for finding everything I needed (0) star for poor service!</Review>

They didn't Deserve to work for the store because they dont greet the people like their customer instead they occupied themselves with gossipping. They are rude people.. Customer service to assist their clients not to ignore.. Who they think they are?, walmart dont them. Remember their paycheck comes customer.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
The employees are so lazy they don't want to be helpful at all, Everytime we're in there there they are just walking around,
Tried complaining to manager all I got was I'm sorry, don't be sorry just fix the problem.
And heaven forbid you ask a question and get someone who knows nothing, or doesn't speak English, I'm surprised they have survived this long.
It's sad an American company has no idea how to train employees<//Review>

The Optical center is great, but I received a call from them today and when I called back on the main phone number it just rang and rang until it was picked up and then hung up again. I thought, "Okay, their busy.", so I called back a half hour latter only to get the same treatment....but then again, what do you expert from a store like this walmart. I was, however, able to find a direct line to the Optomitry department and that phone was answered after the second ring.<//Text>

<Review>What's up with this walmart employees? No one wants to help and most of them gives you an attitud when you ask them specially the Filipino ladies and What's with them blocking olmost all the walkway and sone of them you can tell when you look around that is not necessarily to block the customers way.
prices are good but employees in the afternoon sucks big time with their attitud< /Review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><review>Nightmare!  I HATE this store now. Everything is locked up in personal care and cosmetics. Even inexpensive face wash that is less than a few dollars is locked up. So then they keep it behind the counter at the makeup station so you have to buy all your stuff there or you can wait in two lines that are extremely long to buy at the one register  and then your groceries at the other register.
Frequently out of stuff. Extremely crowded.
They do have a good fruit and vegetable selection.</review>< pics>

<review>This store is in an area where they have a lot of shoplifting.  I went to buy a bicycle tire tube.  They have them along with many other items locked in a case.   You have to find a clerk who takes it out and told me it would be at checkstand #15. I went to that checkstand and it was not there.  This Walmart is a dump,  I will not shop there again.< /review></record>

<Text>The Optical center is great, but I received a call from them today and when I called back on the main phone number it just rang and rang until it was picked up and then hung up again. I thought, "Okay, their busy.", so I called back a half hour latter only to get the same treatment....but then again, what do you expert from a store like this walmart. I was, however, able to find a direct line to the Optomitry department and that phone was answered after the second ring.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The best Walmart in San Jose region (with exception of the Rancho Dr. / Milpitas store. Sadly, even though this Walmart is huge, it still runs out of stock on certain items. On the positive side, when ever I needed help, I've been able to find a competent and helpful employee.</text>

<Text>I went to the store for oatmeal, raisin, vanilla almond milk and walnuts, I found everything I needed except the raisins. I had to walk through the store looking for help and when I finally found help their English was so terrible, they didn't understand me and I didn't understand them, this happened three times, nobody speaks clear English over there. I guess that's how Wal-Mart keeps pricing low, they hire immigrants with little to no speaking English ability. (4) stars for finding everything I needed (0) star for poor service!</Text><Name>L39ACE ARIES< /Name><Gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8< /Gmap_id><time>1500227771375</time></record></dataset><record>

Walmart  is "THE WALMART "  i.e the only store that survived in Bay area were you can buy from groceries to TV .All others like Zoddys ,Gemco Kmart  etc etc. Became part of History.</Text>

Walmart is just awful. I came here to get my kids some school supplies (not at the beginning of the school year) and nothing was stocked. I shouldn't be surprised with how much they pay their workers, I would be apathetic, too. Next time I'll just shop local and spend the extra few bucks.</Text>

Walmart  is "THE WALMART "  i.e the only store that survived in Bay area were you can buy from groceries to TV .All others like Zoddys ,Gemco Kmart  etc etc. Became part of History.< /review>

<text>I will not be returning to this particular Walmart after several visits. It is consistently busy, dirty, disorganized and generally offers an unpleasent shopping experience. I already disliked this location, however the last straw for me was poor customer service from a employee named Terasita. I will happily make the drive to another location rather than give this location any business.</text><user_id>110285480367403627320<//user_id><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< name>

<review>⛔️😷They have a health department for this area in the City of San Jose?
I write about RESTROOMS.
HEALTH and CLEANING, NOTHING!

📌 PLEASE VISIT THE 🚽 RESTROOMS! WOW.

🤒🤒 They ( Store manager or Walmart owners ) know what is the Health Protaction for food or costumers?
I'm NOT sure.
I ask for manager but she didn't answer. Maybe she She don't care 🤷‍♀️
NO HEALTH CONTROL FOR WALMART? Interesting!<//review>< userid>

I ordered a futon online which was indicated available for pick up at this location. Not only It took 35 minutes to get the manager to authorize but item was not available without any explanation. It was pretty disguised and misleading to drive always there when it said ready for pick up online.</Text>

< Review>
Security a little pushy. A lady caused a disturbance in line at door when employee checking receits put his hand on ladys son . I politely informed security rhat we as patrons signed no contract or entered into a membership agreement with store and that from point of sale onward its not store property its mine. Me i dont steal or disrespect anothets rights as to person prooerty ect. But i dont like authoritative individuals who twist the law as suits there needs. I was asked to leave store as this 285lbs teied to have me leqve i wouldnt accept this behavior on his part so i continued dialog with employe3 hopibg to educate him with the right comprehension of law or at least plant a seed of desire for him to seek out answer with his employer.<//Review>

Worst!!! Customer service ever!! How are people selected to work at the customer service desk? By how ignorant, incompetent, and uneducated, they are? The two people there now just couldn't explain to me how a full return is done and why I was unable to return something needless to say with a receipt. They couldn't even answer the question if all Walmart are a chain. They said each Walmart had their own return policy and they each returned what they wanted. That they did not have to put their return policy on the receipts. She even said, that if they did that it would take a whole page. Uhmm are u serious?<//text>

<review>By far one of the worse Walmarts for lines. They have a lot, but if you're really there to buy maybe like 5 items the express line sometimes is a 30 min wait, and the regular lines can be 45mins+

It's pretty awful. Great produce, bread/bakery, and some good variety of items so that's why I gave 3stars, but -2 for the awful lines.< /review>< gmap_id>

Pro-Great variety of everything ! Definitely the go to place especially for those home-restock- grocery trips!
Con-I only wish they'd have more cashier's working at those busy times-especially at night before they close ... Would make things alot smoother and the wait in line alot shorter....< /Review>

I've lost my wallet here, all importtant cards, cash, key in my wallet was lost, then one minute I told with supervisor here, checked the camera they found a woman who had taken my wallet, but they told me that because of my lost wallet so they did not care, their security personnel only work when losing their products, I was very disappointed, I've called 311 to reported they said would come but I had to wait 5 hours at here but did not see anyone coming, I'm 8 months pregnant, but no one helped me, cashiers in Walmart they just looked at me waiting with no concerns, I will never again buy shopping at Walmart because they do not need customers, then customers will not need them, i also heard someone were  lost somethings here but never come back</Review><rate>1< /rate></record>

<text>I called on the phone to ask about an item, they said if I drove FROM MILPITAS that they would give me the item I was looking for (it was an OTC pharmacy item so I didnt know it was locked up. Upon getting there I basically had to beg a CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER to give me the item and she still would not, when I started to ask her questions as I became upset, she ignored me outright. Really Wal-Mart? This is BS even for you. Burn in hell and go out of business.< /text>< pictures>

Decent walmart in the San Jose area. Gets the usual walmart crowd, but the produce section is usually pretty well stocked. There is also a lady outside who sells Tamale.<//Review>

I just have to say. Having never (still) going to bbc.co this location on 3 different evenings, weeks apart;I called to ask one simple question...Are you open 24 hours? Most calls have resulted in a pick up, hang up super quickly after the phone rings for a couple minutes. Tonight I let it ring 7 minutes with ZERO answer attempt. What the he'll are there admin people doing? No answers? Pick up, hang ups? HORRIBLE phone service and I haven't even attempted To go to the location. I'm F'n flabbergasted at there lack of caring about any thing obviously.</Text>

This store needs way more staff.  Every time I have been here, it takes a million years to get some help.  Also, forget calling the customer service line to see if they have something ahead of time; you'll be on hold/hung up on if you're even lucky they answer.  This is why I shop at Amazon, because by the time someone answers my call at Walmart, Amazon has already sent me my item.<//text>

Great store, stayed the night in the parking lot, while on a road trip. Woke up to a dead battery, and a manager with a hybrid was kind enough to assist us, which required taking the time to figure out how to even jump a normal car from a hybrid.<//Review>

They have disabled parking out the second entry, but then lock those doors after 8pm and force elderly and handicapped people to hobble or push a wheelchair around from the furthest door away. Genius.</text>

Good variety and prices and great fruit and vegetable selection.  Frustrating to buy any beauty or cosmetics. It is either locked up or I secluded shopping areas.</Text>

This place is HUGE and always fully stocked!!, I rarely get told that an item is really out of stock,...nice volume in general and super savings  is a first concerne...the only thing is I dont live too too close to them,...so, if i could find what i need at a closer one I would, but i always end up heading to story road location within the next month or less.....because my product isn't regular stock iteniary......i hope shopping will be this good forever!!!<//Review>

<text>It was horrible today! Long lines, Kids running around unattended. And if you need to buy make- up you have to go in a corral & can only buy it there. But low & behold , there are shoppers ( some aren't even buying make-up) paying there. So if you want to buy a lipstick for example,  you have to wait in the long long line. It sucks!! Oh & I had to hunt down a cart outside. Very bad experience today 👎😠< /text>< Pics>

<review>Most stuff cheaper than target, but I hate how packed it gets and how there's a bunch of staff but only a few registers opened. Return area needs to be opened at least until 10 considering they close at 12am and both 20 item or less areas should be open until closing. They have everyone waiting in super long lines just because of the lack of employees at each cashier when they can clearly see the main walkway is entirely blocked off with people waiting.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808fccd4f21df13d:0x45d9bee310def4b8< /Gmap_id><username>BGoodeez *</username><date>1502612149689< /date><resp>None</resp><Rating>4</Rating>< user_id>

< review>
Worst customer service ever.
I was here at 8.00 pm. They have all the gates to enter. Except one. It took time for me to figure out which one is open. And few minutes to locate the customer service desk. I am here to return the defective blender.
I have reached them at 8.10pm. The manager was reluctant to listen me. He said th ey were closed by 8.00PM. I patiently explained the reason but he was reluctant to listen me. Moreover he said it's my fault as I was late. And asked me to come by 6.00 AM next morning.

Wal-Mart, teach manners for your managers. Then run for money.

I will never visit this store again. Safe way is far better than this.< /review>

<review>Last night my 60 year old physically disabled mother and I spent 2 hours and over $300 Christmas shopping at this store location. By the end of it she was obviously in pain. I rarely get her to use the electric shopping cart and last night was no different so she had a really rough time towards the end. We purchased our items and went to leave only to find the door was locked which was the door that we had parked at to come into in the handicap section. There was another physically disabled woman with her family by the locked doors, saying they were telling her they wouldn't let her out to her vehicle and that she had to walk the length of the store twice after walking throughout the store for the evening as well. We asked for a manager. The three workers we had talked to were not only extremely rude, but one of them scoffed at the other disabled woman when she said she couldn't walk the length of the store twice or her knees might give out saying to her "oh yeah?" after she explained her physical disability. It was visibly extremely demeaning. The other worker pretended to try to open the door for us even though he kne he didn't have the right key just to 'satisfy' the idea of them actually helping. They all refused to get the manager saying "they had called her" one other worker had actually said very rudley I'm trying to assist a customer and dismissed us. We had all just spent our hard earned money at this establishment and were being treated terribly. I finally had to go find the manager myself, in which she replied she was unaware of the situation completely even though there were now 3 disabled people at the locked door for 15 minutes. As she walked me to the door to begrudgingly let us out she even said, "they will all need to show their receipts" as though we were potential theives. She in fact did not make us show receipts as she walked up and saw 3 elderly disabled women visibly upset. It was demeaning to the disabled and negligent to theor safety. Had that woman attempted to walk all that way she very well may have had her knees give out, and they seemed to have cared less. As for my mother, she would have been in even more pain. I am disgusted with walmart right now as having been a life long customer and had half the nerve to return everything in that cart that very moment. And I regret having not done so. I will never return to this location again unless it's to raise hell. I had already started to consider never shopping at Walmart at all anymore before this happened and now I'm reconsidering ever going there again. In fact, I most likely won't unless its absolutely completely necessary to do so.< /review><user>109550129959105626555<//user><Time>1513990293872< /Time>< pics>

<Text>This place is disghusting as hell. On multiple occasions ive seen cockroaches on the walls behind the MCdonalds food area. I know an employee who told me they saw a bed bug on a clothing item on their shelves. When i joked around and said whats next rats in the stockroom they said no rats but skunks get back there all the time. Top it off with lousy customer service no one ever in their department. And dont go shopping at night. Around 8pm they only have about 4 check lanes open guess they dont believe people shop after 8pm. Avoid this place at all costs< /Text>< name>

The problem I have is... a large percentage of their workforce are ESL.  When I can actually find someone to ask, they don't always understand me. I came here to get men's rain boots which they had.</text>

This Walmart is bad. I tried to make a key and the machine wasn't functioning. They didn't have the car air filter I needed. Though, the employee service was regular.< /review>

this place stinks, so many rude Hispanics that actually take parking lot seriously. Worse place ever. So many perverted Hispanics here. I feel so unsafe and had to check my back every 10 minutes to make sure no one is following me. It creeps me out.<//Review>

< Review>
Today at this Wal-mart was a disappointment!. The meat department was near empty and No one around to ask WHERE ARE THE MEATS??? Question should ve been "Where is the SERVICE here? Plus I HATE trying to go around a squeeze between boxes crates on the isle way. I'm handicap so YES it's not easy!  WAKE THIS WAL-MART UP!<//Review>

<review>Very bad service and staff don't know much and not very helpful in answering questions. The delivery pick-up center never answer the phone. I tired over several days several times and gave up. The receptionist didnt help when trying to explain the problem. Keep away if you don't want to waste your time< /review>< pics>

Staff were rude and unhelpful. Staff were talking to each other in isles blocking customers and ignoring those asking for help. When we did get a member of staff to try and purchase some electronics they could not find the key to open the cabinet and were less then helpful. I really like Walmart and visited lots in the USA from coast to coast but would avoid this one!</Review>

<Review>This place is ridiculous. I had a barcode saved to my phone for an item I was looking for that could easily be scanned by anyone.
I walked around the store for 30 min, talked to 7 employees (3 of which had a hand held scanners) 2 claimed they couldn't help me because theirs was broken and the 3rd said hers was dead because it was a piece of crap.
Finally they had to get the store manager. Really? To scan a barcode? The manger took my phone and disappeared only to return 13 min later to inform me that my phone was dyeing and he couldn't see the screen anymore. He told me when I got home I could just call and give someone the barcode over the phone.

I went to my car and noticed even though my screen may have been too dim to scan you could still read the barcode numbers. What the hail?

I plugged my phone in the charger anyways and call the store from my phone like the manager said. A lady from "customer service" answers the phone and tells me she cannot find items with the UPC code. I tell her the store manager told me to call and give customer care the code and she interrupts me with a sigh of sarcasm and says "What's the item and I'll transfer you?" I tell her and I bet you can guess what happened next. Yep, she hung up on me. I called back a second time, was transferred, and the person in the department put me on hold and the line went dead after 7min. Called a third time got transferred by customer service again, the phone line was disconnected after 3 min.

No thank you, I'll find somewhere else to go.<//Review>< user>

Would give negative rating if possible. The store feels like a prison with almost everything in a locked case giving the impression that I had to worry about being robber in Walmart or by Walmart. No one was around to help, and no one had keys. If I wanted to have someone do all my shopping for me I'd pay for a personal shopper.</review>

<review>This is the worst Walmart in the Bay Area.
I called ahead to make sure they had what I was looking for in stock. arrived couldn't find it then they told me it wasn't in stock even though I had called and checked online and it said in stock.
Customer service department manager literally was using her cell phone and their website to help me instead of just turning on their computer and looking for the item.

Morons here.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Worst customer service ever! I've called 3 Walmarts in the Saratoga, story rd and stevens creek. Nobody picked up the phone. I tried calling for 23 minutes. not one single answer. 38 minutes later someone picked up the phone then transferred me to Pharmacy and pharmacy didn't pick up at all in 10 mins. Got tired of waiting. Never shopping walmart again and I'm protesting to all my family and friends not to shop there. They don't care about answering phones. I wonder what the corporate office is doing about this.< /Text>

I will always wallmart and for one reason or no employees tor customer service do not even know the letter "S". stop customers a very inconsiderate for and gresera apart make it feel as if they were thieves, abesandolos scologicamente and not particularly in the case of moving from ready with customers and charging them more for their prices are, it's a shame because it seems that hire anyone without checking because of its record stops coming out of jail straight to work for Wallmar, all have tattoos outside bargains are expressed poorly and walk dirty and unkempt well, they spend talking instead of helping customer in your area tratajo, they look waiting in paint or other commercial centers and want them to ask a question and you answer I do not work here I bringing uniform saying wallmart wowowowow at the entrance stop customers illegally since nobody should stop a person without his authorization. niciquiera the police can do it because they believe it is a shame that neither know their prices. what a shame that wallmart is one of the largest chains and their sometimes disastrous one always have to be taking pictures of everything I buy to not charge me the dobble wowowowwwwwww. no doubt this year the best award for best store will take, the more friendly if you have to mention something very important that sometimes these things we teller snatch us scratching or pulling at us and that seems to them, there still work there when the law prohibits a person touches another work in a customer service position that seems precious,,,,,,, awake .... wallmart hires people to work who knows education and treat people with respect. not to laugh at you in front of your own loved ones and Community helllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo friends. It is a very, very poor service the truth ........</Text>

If you're going to need help with something, don't come here. Their customer service is abysmal. After pressing the assistance button that's supposed to bring someone to you for (I'm not joking or exaggerating) 10 minutes, and getting ignored by every employee that walked by (5) I finally tracked a manager-looking person down who said he'd get someone over to help me. It's been 5 minutes, I'm going to Target.<//Review>

If I could give this walmart zero stars I would. It's in a ghetto location of San Jose, crowded, and has some of the rudest workers I've ever seen. I went there to get passport photos done, waited 15 minutes for a worker to get a photo department person only to be told there would be no one to take passport photos for me available until 11am, despite a sign clearly saying the photo department is open at 9am. Spoke to a manager afterward who was totally unapologetic and walked away from me while I spoke. Absolutely horrible service, I'll never go to this Walmart again.< /text>

Please train your employees, even if they don't speak English fluently, when a customer needs help they can help. During my one hour shopping trip today and out of the 7 people I asked for help in different departments and the 2 at self check out NOT 1 single employee had any idea how to help me with any of my needs, and 5 of them looked at me like I was crazy and had no idea what I even said at all. Just because it's the East Side, doesn't mean you shouldn't care about your customers that shop there and keep your stores open. It's not fair to your customers or your staff, I'm sure they would feel happier at work if they could actually do there job and know how to.

UPDATE, MY VISIT TODAY:
Here we go again, I came early to avoid the crowds and here I am in my 3rd line later. It's just crazy to me how Walmart should hire people who never mind don't speak English and can't figure out how to explain anything to you but if you just don't know what you're doing that's crazy wine one she can figure out how to help me she didn't understand what I was trying to tell her and she had not this place idea how to help me so I had to move into. I'm saying went to seven minutes later she still helping the first customer I'm about six people so I go to my number three and I'm still waiting. It's so sad obviously because we are on the east side of San Jose this is not only acceptable but there OK not only hiring anybody that will fill out an application but just putting people out to work even though they obviously have not been trained, or have any idea what there doing or how to help a customer...I'm so annoyed 😒<//text>

Needed help with some items in sporting goods,  and there was no one to be found in the department. This lasted about 30 minutes before I gave up and left.</Review>

<Text>I will always wallmart and for one reason or no employees tor customer service do not even know the letter "S". stop customers a very inconsiderate for and gresera apart make it feel as if they were thieves, abesandolos scologicamente and not particularly in the case of moving from ready with customers and charging them more for their prices are, it's a shame because it seems that hire anyone without checking because of its record stops coming out of jail straight to work for Wallmar, all have tattoos outside bargains are expressed poorly and walk dirty and unkempt well, they spend talking instead of helping customer in your area tratajo, they look waiting in paint or other commercial centers and want them to ask a question and you answer I do not work here I bringing uniform saying wallmart wowowowow at the entrance stop customers illegally since nobody should stop a person without his authorization. niciquiera the police can do it because they believe it is a shame that neither know their prices. what a shame that wallmart is one of the largest chains and their sometimes disastrous one always have to be taking pictures of everything I buy to not charge me the dobble wowowowwwwwww. no doubt this year the best award for best store will take, the more friendly if you have to mention something very important that sometimes these things we teller snatch us scratching or pulling at us and that seems to them, there still work there when the law prohibits a person touches another work in a customer service position that seems precious,,,,,,, awake .... wallmart hires people to work who knows education and treat people with respect. not to laugh at you in front of your own loved ones and Community helllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo friends. It is a very, very poor service the truth ........</Text><response>None< /response>< date>

<Text>This place is understaffed. A lot of items are locked up but there are not enough employees with keys to help customers.  We picked up an online order and I was afraid  the guy helping put it in the car would break something. He kept pushing when it wouldn't fit through the door and I had to tell him to stop and reorient it.</Text>< Gmap_id>

The store advertised trailer tires for sale & in stock ready to pick up at 777 story road. When I got there I found out there is no auto center and no tires ...very disappointed to having made  long drive for nothing.<//Text>

Left my phone there. I called and asked if they had my phone. 3 times I was told no. I went there and asked if my phone was there and again I was told no. So that night I remembered I had a gps on it. I tracked it down. It was showing that my phone was at Walmart. So the following day I went to Walmart again asking for my phone. The girl that helped me went and checked register 15 and said no it wasn't there. I asked if she haf a phone. She replied yes. She called it. The was right in front of her. I seen it. That is why I asked her to call. They will rip you off if they can< /review>

This Walmart has all you need from food to clothing. Of course you can beat the price. There's a Mcdonalds, optometry, and a currency exchange within the store. I was surprised they sell Levi's at Walmart Rollback prices.</text>

<Review>Half the shelves aren't even marked with prices and the cashier was the slowest I have seen in my 35 years of existence. It's like they don't care as they know people will shop here regardless. Avoid this place if you can!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I was shopping for replacement parts for my son's bicycle and after pressing the assistance button several times. I went to ask for assistance personally still with no success. I waited for 25 minutes before someone came to help. I have been a long time customer of this store not anymore I'd rather take my business to Target<//review>

This Walmart has all you need from food to clothing. Of course you can beat the price. There's a Mcdonalds, optometry, and a currency exchange within the store. I was surprised they sell Levi's at Walmart Rollback prices.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A big supermarket that also handles food. Everything from daily necessities to clothing is available, and it's cheap, so it's helpful.
I often use it when I am on a business trip, but I always buy a few dozen packs of water and tend to lack fruits and vegetables. The cash register is self-service and takes time at first, but once you get used to it, you can easily buy it without hesitation.
The clerk checks the receipt at the exit, so be careful not to throw away the receipt.

(Original)
食品も取り扱っている、大きなスーパーマーケットです。日用品から、衣服まで何でも取り揃えられており、しかも安いので助かります。
出張の時に良く利用していますが、いつも数ダースパックになった水と、不足しがちなフルーツ、野菜を購入しています。レジはセルフになっていて、最初は手間取りますが、慣れてくると、気兼ね無く購入出来るので楽だったりします。
出口で店員がレシートをチェックするので、レシートは捨てないで取っておく必要があり、注意です。</Review>

(Translated by Google) The prices are affordable and they have a great variety of both food and items and sometimes you have discounts that are worth thinking about two kisses.

(Translated by Google) The service of the area where the deodorants are now locked, one rings the bell to be attended and the employee does not arrive, although there were 2 employees in that area they did not want to attend to each other they said they attend you that is fatal and uncomfortable and in the work shoes area, I wanted a pair but there was not in my number, they only have a couple of different styles and there is no one to attend. I could not buy them.

(Original)
El servicio del área dónde están ahora los desodorantes están con llave, toca uno el timbre para que lo atiendan y no llega el empleado, aunque habían 2 empleados en esa área no nos querían atender una a otra se decían atienda usted eso es fatal e incómodo y en el área de zapatos de trabajo, yo quería un par pero no había en mi número, sólo tienen un par de diferentes estilos y no hay quién atienda.

(Translated by Google) Very very big. You will find everything if you have patience. In any case, they do not have everything on their website, but you can order or send them there. It has parking and there are also some other businesses inside, like a Mc Donald's.

(Original)
Muy, muy, grande. Se encuentra de todo si tenés paciencia. De todas formas no tienen todo lo que está en su página web, pero se puede pedir o line a que lo envíen allí. Tiene estacionamiento y también hay algunos otros negocios dentro, cómo un Mc Donald's.< /review>
