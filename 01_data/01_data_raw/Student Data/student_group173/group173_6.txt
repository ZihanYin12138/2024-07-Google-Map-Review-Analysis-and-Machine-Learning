<review>Marcela is a very knowledgeable and professional masseuse! My husband and I do not go anywhere else for massages now. She comes to our place and it’s amazing! She’s SO STRONG!!! She can give massages for hours in a row and still go deep tissue.
She truly is the best masseuse we’ve ever gone to. My mom is a massage addict and when she comes visit we call Marcela!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

Marcela has magic hands...She knows where the pain is and works on it. I love her firm pressure throughout the massage, I don't have to keep asking more pressure, like other places I've been. I feel rejuvented after my massage with her, she is amazing! I would recommend her to anyone!<//Review>

<Review>I have seen Marcella many times.  She has strong, intuitive hands that work wonders on any condition.

I recently have been doing a lot of physical labor which caused me to not be able to straighten my back.  I did not tell her and she observed a hump in the middle of my back.  She dug into every muscle.  I was sore from her massage the next day.  By day 2, I felt my spine return to a straight position.

I could not believe it.

Marcela has the experience to read your muscles and fix your pain.  Highly recommended!< /Review>< rating>

<Text>I had tightness and pain in my neck and upper back due to stress. I couldn't turn my head as easy and I had a difficult time sleeping. Maricela incorporated stretches with a deep tissue massage. And I mean stretches! After a session of deep tissue I did a calming massage(Swedish?) which helped to relax my body after the workout. I highly recommend Maricela and doing the combination of deep tissue with a relaxing massage afterwards.<//Text><user_id>100026969992690281256<//user_id>< response>

I have to say Marcela provided one of the best relaxing massages I have had in a long time.  She worked out all my soreness and I left feeling refreshed and pain free.  She is very friendly and is skilled at her craft in providing excellent massages.  I highly recommend and will definitely return.  Try her out after a long day a work....you will forget you even worked that day after getting a massage from her!<//Review>

Marcela is both an amazing massage therapist, & an incredible woman overall. The massage itself was much better than anticipated, the stress from an entire week lifted. Most definitely recommend to anyone, & I’ll absolutely come back to her. Much love.< /review>

Marcela is a sweet lady but don’t be fooled. She has the hands of a hard worker and I promise you will be able to relieve even the greatest of stresses. I had an extremely stiff neck that was giving me trouble with sleep and was just terrible to live with. Now I have new found life with this relief and am able to relax in bed and not feel the need to keep tossing and turning. Thank you so much Marcela not only for my neck but also for the full body massage and body scrub that renewed my skin. I will definitely be coming back for a therapeutic massage. 5 stars. 🙌< /Text>

<Review>One of the best massages I have ever gotten and I am a self proclaimed massage afficionado. Marcela is so friendly, courteous, professional but most of all EFFECTIVE! I am currently 6 months pregnant and I need major body areas worked out. My problem areas are my upper back. Being pregnant, most prenatal massages are mere application of lotion or oil. There's typically no pressure or intensity. Not with Marcela. She's perienced experienced for 15 years so she knows exactly what she's doing. She works out all of my tension and problem areas. I may be sore the next day but my knots are gone. She even stretches you out during the massage. If you need vital body work, give her a call, you will not regret it!<//Review>< Pictures>

Marcela is extremely professional and by far give the best massages I have ever received. Her years of experience shows and she definitely ensures that any aches or pains you have are address. She is my go to now especially since I am physically active and getting older Marcelas massages really help me with my recovery and I would recommend 100% she talks fast but her work is great.<//text>

<Review>Marcella could tell where I was tense, was very aggressive (like I wanted) in some problem yet delicate in more sensitive areas without me having to give much direction. She also implemented stretching to help alleviate tightness and to improveflexibility. She went the extra mile. I've recommended her to my friends and have received her services several times.< /Review>< userid>

Marcela is a massage therapist who really cares about helping you. She's able to give you a strong and deep massage to get those deep knots out of your muscles. She can use stretch methods like those used in Thai massage or soft Swedish strokes.  She asks if the pressure is good, are you comfortable, do you want the fan turned on,etc. It's all about you. You'll leave feeling like a new person.<//Text>

Magic in her hands is what I felt during the massage Marcela performed. This is only my third massage and first by Marcela. The others don't even compare. Throughout the massage, she ensured I always felt comfortable and made adjustments if needed. Marcela is in great shape with strong hands. She used various techniques to stretch my muscles and massage the stiffness out. My body is completely satisfied and I feel great. Thank you Marcela! You are gifted. I will visit again soon. 👌</text>

Massage by marcela is by far the best out there! I work out alot and I get sore often, whenever I get a massage by marcela I recover faster and am ready to train hard once again! What makes Marcelas massage one of the best is that she really gets deep and hard which is what I need. She knows what she is doing and she knows how to establish a good relationship with people to ensure that they come back again< /review>

<Review>So I google looking to get my first massage, like real massage after being on earth for 30 years. I find Marcela called her, first she hung up on me then texted me “text only”. I text her she advised me to look at her reviews but I had already done that and was super duper excited to have my first “real” massage be from Marcela based on the reviews. So she tells me she has 8pm available and it’ll be $80 a hour. Cool I booked that hour. Took a $35 Uber there and she suddenly stop texting me me. I waited for about 15 minutes then called a Uber to go back home so I spent $70 for nothing. She never texted back until I told her I will be writing a review. So yea she me be great with her hands, but’s seems I will never know.<//Review>< Pics>

I was have a day filled with back pain and was looking for a massage in the south bay, found Marcela , and luck would have it she has a very nice in home studio in Chula Vista . even more luck she was gracious enough to get me in on short notice... Once I arrived she met me and took the time to ask about any problem areas and took the time to find out what I needed . Her Massage was very professional . she went to work on my shoulder and back , she also made sure that she took extra time to find knots that needed attention .  She has a great attitude and continued to ask if pressure was ok and if I was ok . this is a must  massage if you are in need of pain relief, or just want a great massage ... Marcela Thank you again.<//Text>

After a rocky start, Emily Hoffman went above and beyond to get my issue resolved. Between the buying and selling of cars and having quite a few other recreational and business vehicles on my account we we’re bound to have a mixup. Emily even worked on her day off to help me get everything squared away. They were professional and responsive the whole way and now I’m insured and ready to go! Thank you Emily for all your hard work!< /Text>

< review>
Very professional when I called about a rate increase due to an accident claim. Prior to my call, they had already taken initiative to optimize some details on my policy to lower my rate without changing my coverage.

They then put me in touch with someone from claims to get more information about my accident. Based on my poor initial description of the accident, claims had found we were at fault but after they asked me to clarify, they determined we were not at fault and changed the claim from collision to comprehensive and avoided the rate increase.

They were very polite and explained all my questions.<//review>

They are always looking out for their customers and conduct insurance reviews to ensure you are getting the most for your money, as well as making sure you are receiving any discounts available to you!  They have always processed my claims quickly and fairly, making sure to keep me informed throughout the process.  They are very personable and helpful whenever I contact them!<//review>

This week I had to call in to update my car insurance info and worked with Emily about what would be best for the new car. She explained the coverages and options very well. Additionally she asked about renters insurance and that was an area that I hadn't thought about. Needless to say the coverage benefits for the cost made it a no brainer. Before we were done on the phone I already had a temp insurance card emailed to me. For the renters insurance I work with Irene and just like with Emily I was provided the information about the different levels of coverage and that helped with deciding what would be best for me.< /text>

Juan Carlos was very thorough very professional and he even called me back to follow up even when he knew that he wasn’t gonna be able to get me the quote right away like he had said he kept me in the loop at every step of the way and I feel like that made it comfortable and easy. Juan Carlos was also very informative, courteous, polite, and friendly.< /review>

I was very frustrated with the State Farm corporate office who were leaving me in a situation where my vehicle was not operational and not covered because a specific code wasn’t being produced at the repair shop.   Called the local office who emulate the work ethic of their owner and the problem was quickly resolved.  Thank you again Chris.</Review>

<text>I just have to say Gary and his staff are hands down the best I have ever dealt with! They are very knowledgeable and you can tell they really truly care about their customers, they are not just trying to sell you another policy.  I can now say that for the first time ever I actually understand my insurance and what I am paying for.  Thank you Gary and staff for being so helpful and making me feel like you truly care about me and my family and what is best for us.  I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>In searching for new car insurance, I decided to give the local guys a chance. After checking around town, I called Gary's office for a quote. Gary's known in the community for serving others, and I was happy to discover that his staff also values great service to their customers. To top it off, I was able to save money compared to what I had been paying for years now, and they were able to also get me the lowest price I found on homeowners insurance as well. They say they're different from other companies, and they show it in the best way possible.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c1132e1a4ac25f:0x585a4af3a69898a0<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1601656355668, 'text': 'Thank you for your review Lee!

I’m new to town and Gary and his team came highly recommended. I had no issues getting my policies transferred, and the staff I dealt with on the phone and in person were courteous, efficient and very knowledgeable. My old office has nothing on this State Farm office- they are great!! I highly recommend them!</review>

These people really know their stuff. They can talk insurance and investments. I now understand the importance, as well as, the financial benefit of adding permanent life insurance to my portfolio. I even saved money on my term insurance too. Take the time to review your accounts as it will save you a ton of money over the long-term.</Review>

This office truly cares! I've never had an insurance agency take time to make sure I really understood my coverages, but Gary's office did. I didn't feel rushed. They answered all of my questions, and brought up things I've never thought about. I'm referring everyone I can. Great job!< /text>

I have had State Farm Insurance for almost 30 years.
I have been with Gary Charlon - State Farm Insurance for 18 of those years.
They have treated my family well and I enjoy their help in providing the best coverage that works for us.
They have good customer service and are willing to help anyway they can.< /review>

I would give them a five star, however, I asked to cancel one insurance policy and they cancelled both.  The 2nd being Life Insurance which I did not ask to be cancelled.  Oh well.</Review>

Hurley never got back to me so 3 weeks later I called back.  I was told Hurley was sick and in and out of the office since my first call and he would call me back the next day.  That didn't happen I called back yet again and was told he was with customers and he would have to call me back.  I assured her that he had a door on his office and to go knock on it.  Because if I didn't have my quote before I hung up the phone I was going elsewhere.  She came back 5 minutes later and said he would have to call me back.  Hurley and Irene need to be fired.  I was once told that it is easy to hire anyone to do a bad job.  Gary Charlon's and State Farm shouldn't allow their potential customers to be driven off by Hurley.< /Text>< name>

<review>I sold my condo and I contacted the office to cancel my policy. They confirm it was cancelled and sent me a letter confirming this was done and asked for a copy of my closing statement which I provided. When I noticed I didnt receive my refund check I called the office and they stated the policy was never cancelled. I didnt own the condo anymore but I have to pay for the insurance on it now because they chose not to cancel my policy like they said they had done to both myself and my realtor. If I could give them zero stars I would. They are not trust worthy and will lie just to keep your money.< /review><Response>{'time': 1601656143866, 'text': 'Hello Cara.

I was in an accident and received speedy and great service. Most things were dealt with and tied up within a few hours. Plus, this office remembers birthdays in our family, as well as other big events in our lives. It's the little things that count sometimes. Thanks State Farm, for everything!< /Review>

Dissatisfied with unprofessionalism, and the delay in which information was relayed to me. In short, I definitely had to follow up with them repeatedly for four  months to fix a mistake that was not made on my end. After 4 months, and no conlflict resolution, but a girl chuckling and creating excuses instead of solid customer service- I am extremely disappointed with my experience.
I still adore State Farm however, but this office is not an embodiment of State Farm's Customer Service Standards.<//Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>We had an amazing experience working with Dan and his team at Solcosta Home Loans.

We were nervous about the ReFi process because of the conditions of our original loan but our monthly payments were outrageous so we finally reached out and explained that we wanted to lower our rate, reduce our monthly payment and pay off our silent second loan.

In working with Dan and his team we were able to accomplish everything! We reduced our rate, lowered our monthly by more than $500 and paid off the second loan.

I cant say enough about how professional, knowledgeable and constantly available everyone was. No matter what we needed or what question we had,  a team member was always there to take care of us.

I would absolutely recommend them to my friends and family!</Text>< Rating>

Dan's professionalism is elite and the quality of help and services they provided exceeded expectations, even in this pandemic. Everything was fast and efficient and easily 5 star service. His constant communication is exactly what you want during a time of house buying. Him and his team closed in under 17 days easily (i dont remember the exact days) and im positive they could have done it quicker if needed. I highly recommend Dan and his team of Solcosta Home Loans to everyone. They wont disappoint. Look foward to working with Dan and his team in the future.

Dan Patty at Solcosta made our experience with this home purchase so simple. We were working with another lender before Dan but after talking with him and the way he responded almost instantly to all questions and request, we knew this was the person we wanted to work with and it turned out to be the perfect business transaction. We highly recommend him to anyone looking for a home loan.<//review>

<text>As a brand new home owner going into 2021, there is a lot to say about Dan Patty and Solcosta Home Loans. Previous to working with Dan I had an extremely bad experience with a lender where he was very rude, unresponsive, and at one point I asked him to run some numbers for me so I can see how much I needed to save up and he replied with “give me a call when you’re serious about buying a house”. After that I was referred to Dan. Nothing but the complete opposite of the rude lender. Dan answered every question at pretty much any time of day. Super responsive, very knowledgeable, willing to actually explain how the process worked, and would even make quick videos just to physically show me numbers. It has been a great experience and I 100% recommend Dan and Solcosta Home Loans. Because of them I just closed on my first home.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609453722997, 'text': 'Congratulations on your first home, Jake!

<review>Dan Patty has been absolutely REMARKABLE!

I found Dan from my boyfriend's, sister's friends when I first started searching for a home. My boyfriend and I were looking for mobile homes and condos because we thought that was the only thing we can afford, but Dan pointed out that we can afford a single family home.

So weekend after weekend, we searched throughout the Bay Area and this week we finally closed in on our first ever house! I still can't believe it!

Dan was very thorough with his explanations, quick to respond to all of our emails and overall super helpful in helping us purchase our first home.

Thank you SO much again Dan for making our dreams come true! I already recommended you to a banker I spoke with and a few other friends, and will definitely be posting about you on social media!<//review>< user_name>

<Text>Dan Patty guided us through financing two houses and then refinancing them a year later (December 2020). His expertise and clear explanations made the process painless for us.  He was always quick to answer e-mails, phone messages and text messages and to keep us informed throughout the process. My husband and I highly recommend Solcosta Home Loans and Dan Patty!< /Text>< pics>

<text>In 2018 I made an offer to purchase my first home. There were lots of bids, and my realtor advised that I needed a competitive offer not only in price, but a quick closing as well. She recommended Dan Patty. I called and he responded immediately. After a few questions he told me that he specialized in quick closing.  This was written in the offer, (and a big part of the reason it was accepted!). Fast forward two years, and I decided to look into refinancing in order to lower my interest rate and monthly payment. I contacted Dan Patty, and after answering just a couple of questions he provided four estimates with refinance options. I shopped around for another day, but could not find a lower rate or fees,  and no one else could do a term of 28 years. The application process was very easy to complete online and I was able to submit all of the documentation through the secure website.  The entire process from my first call to Dan to closing was less than 21 days!  Dan is friendly, extremely knowledgeable and always quick to respond to any questions. It was a pleasure to have him assist in refinancing my home. I recommend Dan Patty to anyone looking for quality Mortgage Brokerage services.<//text><Rating>5</Rating><user>117389229892078641638<//user>< username>

I've never had a better experience with a mortgage broker! Dan is so much more than a liaison between you and your lender—he's a strategic business partner who takes the time to get to know you, your finances and your goals and uses that insight to guide you to the right solution. He's knowledgable, hyper-responsive and a heck of a nice guy who will make the process easy. Do yourself a favor and work with Dan.</Text>

Dan Patty is amazing and helped us out so much! We were first time homebuyers and had a lot of questions about everything. He answered every email, phone call request, and every other thing we could throw his way. I had strange hours and would reach out at odd times in the day but he always answered as soon as he could and always clarified whatever we needed to be clarified. We wouldn't have made it to our first home without Dan's patience, understanding, and constant support (along with our agent who worked alongside with Dan as a great team!). I highly recommend Dan as he knows how to get things done with speed but also quality.<//Review>

I feel immensely grateful to have had Dan apart of my journey in buying my first home. He had the answers to all my questions, highly responsive, and kept me organized. Without him, I wouldn't have been able to confidently make an offer. Thank you Dan for making this process seamless and fun. I have already referred 3 of my closest friends to Dan because I am confident he can and will be a valuable key player during their home searching journey.</Review>

Dan Patty was top class-- we could not have been more impressed. He was efficient, knowledgeable, accessible, and extremely competent. He worked so well with everyone on our team and his reputation for being the best preceded him with the realtors and the mortgage brokers. It was only 19 days from when first laid eyes on the house to when it was ours, and the speedy timeline was thanks to Dan Patty. Thank you for helping us realize our dream of buying our house! We give Dan Patty our highest recommendation.<//Text>

<text>I was referred to Dan by a friend because I was not having luck finding a company that would take on a refi for the condominium complex I live in.  I had previously purchased this with an adjustable rate... and after 5 years it could go up.  I’ve always had the intention of refinancing just couldn’t find someone and with Covid issue, it was even harder.  Within a month, we were signed, sealed and I had extra money to do the remodel of the dreams!  Dan was great at communicating and keeping me up to date with process, what papers I needed to provide and was available many times after hours.  Just a great guy to work with and easy.  2.99% fixed 30 yr. rate.  Couldn’t be happier!  Thank you Dan!<//text>< rate>

Dan is professional, incredibly responsive, and works at lightning speed to get his clients the best possible outcome. He has a customer for life here, and I will continue to refer anyone and everyone who’s looking to finance a new home or investment property and/ or refi.</Review>< user_id>

He is amazing... after working with him on the purchase of my first house,

I called him for a refi, at the same time found another house which he facilitated the purchase of.... all in a month and during a pandemic....

Wow

Dan is professional, knowledge and will work with you to make things happen.

Give him a call,
You will not be disappointed!<//review><Time>1603120565293</Time></record>

<review>The legends about Dan are true, he is the man! We were referred to Dan when we were purchasing our first home. He helped us and clarified all steps along the way. He kept us up to date in the process and was super responsive to any calls/texts/e-mails. One of the best things about Dan, he was looking out for us even after our purchase. He informed us of available lower interest rates and helped us refinance at a great rate! Highly recommend using him, he was an absolute pleasure to work with!< /review><name>M. I.< /name>< pictures>

Our journey into buying our first home was scary and uncertain if we would be approved. I found Dan Patty on yelp back in 2017. He was very knowledgeable on everything my husband and I asked about since we knew only the basics on buying a home. Dan made it easier and helpful with his in depth knowledge. Dan was quick in communicating with us on everything and always answered our questions quickly whether we called, texted, or emailed him. We were able to close with Dan on our first home in a matter of a month. So all of October and in our home the 2nd week of November 2017. We were being evicted since owner wanted to sell, so it was either buy our own home or rent to pay for someone else's mortgage. I am so glad I found Dan Patty. He made approving to get a loan and buying a house quick and to the point.
Fast forward to July 2020
I convinced my husband we should refinance since APR rate is low and if seemed like the perfect time to do it. I contacted Dan Patty again to possibly do a refinance with him and see what he can show to us for APR rates. We were very pleased with the rate and decided to go forward with the refinancing with Dan Patty. He is still quick to answer any questions and paperwork that was needed to continue to close. We closed just this week. Overall this time around seemed just as smooth as the first time. We are so happy with our new loan and very grateful for Dan on getting our loan closed so quickly. Very much appreciate the work he did for us!< /Text>

When my wife and I finally decided to buy our home we were introduced to Dan, and I knew from the start that we’d found the right broker. He is efficient, responsive, and highly knowledgeable. Most importantly, he cares for his clients and it shows. He took his time to explain the process along the way, helped us through small bumps in the road, and got us to the finish line! We would gladly work with him again someday.< /Review>

Where can I start?!?! Dan was very responsive, patient and very knowledgeable. He was available any day of the week through phone, e-mail AND text. I appreciate all the options he offered me and my partner. We had been down this path 5 years ago now and Dan informed us of many things that our previous lender never mentioned. You will definitely get the lowest rate possible, A+ service and the home of your dreams is made possible in a short closing time frame! Thanks Dan for all your hard and dedicated work, your passion for this line of work shines through!<//text>

Dan was amazing! He was very helpful with any questions or concerns I had. The whole process went very smooth. He was very trusting and helped me save money each month, exactly what I wanted to happen. I would recommend him to anyone and everyone looking to save and refinance their home.
He’s been a great help.
Thank you Dan Patty!</Review>

<text>I have to give a huge shoutout and thank you to Dan Patty, who was referred to us through VettedVA on FB! Being a Real Estate Agent, I’m used to working with Brokers, but Dan is in a different league.
His knowledge about the mortgage Industry helped us get a great interest-rate and to stay on schedule even when Covid tried to delay our closing date.

If you’re located anywhere in California, reach out to him and I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed that you did.<//text>< Pics>

When i had questions, he had answers. When i wanted to know my options, he sat down with me and laid it all out for me. In my case, i was curious how the interest rate was effected by the size of the down payment. So we sat down in his office, and we played around with all of the numbers to find out what worked best for my family. I will definitely be recommending Dan, to anyone who asks.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am updating my review, it was a 5 star and it is staying a 5 star. I wish I could leave multiple reviews since he did my initial home purchase, and now years later my refinance.

Thanks to Daniel and his team, they worked quickly and pushed to get me in my home as soon as possible (and now refinance as seamless as possible).  I am still amazed at how easy they made this process for me! Any questions that pop in my head, I am still able to reach out to Dan and he's happy to help!

I really appreciate everything they have done for me and will definitely recommend them to everyone who needs a Mortgage Broker.<//Review>

Integrity and expertise are just a piece of what you get with Dan Patty!  Dan knows his numbers and his process so that every part of obtaining a loan is seamless.  If you get a chance to meet Dan face to face you will see that he does a great job because he cares about you and your investments.  It’s not just closing a loan, you immediately feel like he's your greatest advocate!  I’m a big fan and would recommend Dan to anyone looking for a mortgage broker with integrity and heart!< /Review>

<Review>Dan Patty Mortage is high quality service! As a first time homebuyer he made us feel like we were always making the best choice. He was prompt, quick to respond to questions (which I had a lot of), he wrote up estimates, sent them to realtor, explained taxes, looked into loans & programs we could've qualified for and was patient with us in our process.

We had been looking for a house for 3-4 months seriously and talked to 2-3 other brokers who either took to long to respond, did not answer my questions or just told me what they thought I needed to hear based off my income. I ended up doing my own research & found Dan on google. He had several amazing reviews. I hope this just adds to the testimate of his character of his business & integrity towards his clients.
Even after we have bought our house & coming up on tax season Dan continues to check in and send us updates.Thank you Dan for the amazing service looking forward to continuing to work with you & to send clients your way.

< Review>
FIRST TIME BUYER - - To whomever is considering doing business with Mr. Dan Patty...do your self a favor and partner with him, you will not regret it! This man is on top of it! Quick responses, complete and concise answers, no BS, very knowledgeable, and very patient! Most of all, he will certainly sniff out the best possible deals for you. To other first time buyers, do yourself another favor and go with a broker, not a lender! They can typically get you much better rates than a standard lender because they have a large pool of nationwide lenders they pull from for your specific situation. Thankfully, a family member of mine steered me toward Dan because they too had a great experience with him. I was particularly impressed with how low Dan was able to get my "PMI" or Premium Mortgage Insurance. This is typically something you pay if you are putting less than 20% down and the fee eventually goes away. Some PMI fees can be hundreds of dollars if you go with a lender or just get a bad deal. Dan was able to get mine down to just 30 something bucks. Thanks to Dan, I was able to afford more house as a single man than I ever could have imagined when I first set out looking for homes. Hell, this man even promptly returned my message when he was on vacation. He is very technology savvy and is very approachable. Like most things, the hardest part of the process for me was just taking that first step and getting the ball rolling on getting pre-approved for a loan amount. He makes it easy to get started and what he sends you along the way is not overwhelming, but rather very helpful and simple. The home buying process can be inherently stressful, but Dan mitigates that feeling of stress by keeping it simple, professional, and smooth. He didn't know my realtor at all and I received several compliments from my realtor about Dan and how well they worked together. Go with Dan!< /Review>

It has been a pleasure to work with Daniel Patty and his team.  This is our second mortgage refinance with Daniel and both experiences have been very positive.  I would highly recommend working with him.  He is professional, knowledgeable and really goes "above and beyond" to make sure that all details are clear and concise. I was never at a loss for where in the process we were and when I had questions...he answered them promptly. Great communication and people skills... so refreshing!</Text>

Dan was amazing! Trusting someone with your life savings is hard but he made everything so easy for my husband and i as first time buyers. He’s was thorough from beginning to end and we closed in like 2 weeks! Can’t emphasize enough how good he is at what he does, he made us feel secure and also never pushed us to do anything we weren’t ok with. For anyone looking to buy a home soon or in the near future es definitely the guy you need!
Thanks Dan!< /Review>

We financed, then refinanced a home with Dan Patty. He walked us through everything, was patient with our questions and everything went well — both times. The initial purchase of the home had a short closing period because of a situation with the seller, and he was able to get everything done in an expedited manner. When we did our refinance, we thought about going with one of the online services, but decided we wanted to work with someone we knew, and though it cost a little more, I was happy to keep that money in Vallejo.</Text>

My wife and I had the privilege of refinancing our home loan with Dan, but the thing that stood out the most to us was Dan's persistence.  We worked with Dan starting almost two years ago to pre-qualify and map out a plan to re-enter home ownership after suffering a foreclosure (business choice) during the market crash in 2008.  Dan helped us identify areas we could improve on, and advised us of what people in our situation would have to overcome.  We stuck to the plan and were able to get pre-qualified very quickly through Dan.

We kept our eyes on the market, thought about pulling the trigger a couple of times on an offer, but then had the opportunity to purchase our family home from my parents if we could wait a few years.  We told Dan of the plan and he never once seemed discouraged to have worked on our behalf without a deal being done.  He actually helped us identify favorable opportunities that exist when purchasing directly from family (no need for a realtor, possibility of a gift of equity, inheriting the original property taxes, etc.).

As we worked towards the goal of buying our family home Dan continued to work with us and was able to offer us a reasonable loan at the time we were ready to purchase, however after shopping around, specifically through Costco's mortgage program, we were able to get a more favorable loan.  Having developed a friendship with Dan through the years I was nervous about breaking the news to him that all of his work on behalf of my family was not going to conclude with a mortgage deal, but after breaking the news to Dan he said "Mike I completely understand, this is business and you have to do what's best for your family.  This is the best I can do with the options available to me, so please think of me in the future if you are ever in the market again."

Who the hell has that understanding and long term focus?  Dan.

Fast forward to six months after we purchased our family home with the Costco loan and I get an email from Dan explaining that he is his own boss now and that with that authority and an even lower interest rate than was available at the time of our purchase that he believed he could refinance our loan and save us money.

This dude!

Seriously, after working for years and getting nothing from us, he sought us out and offered to help us.  We took him up on the offer and just as he had predicted, Dan was able to shave a full percentage point off of our APR and close to $500 on our monthly bill.

We can't thank Dan enough for his amazing persistence, professionalism, and awareness of client's needs.  We will always shop Dan first, and we strongly encourage anyone in the market to do the same.  Dan Patty walks the walk in an industry known for being full of talkers.<//Review>

Dan is the man! He is super informative and walked me through the entire loan process. He made himself available whenever I had a question (I had a ton!) and always made sure I understood everything before moving me along the process. I trust that Dan is always getting me the best deal and looking out for my interest. Dan will be the first person I reach out to if I ever need another loan again.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Dan is amazing! My wife and I were casually looking for a home in Walnut Creek, and we fell in love with a home that was in our price range. Unfortunately, we weren’t pre-approved so we couldn’t make an offer. I literally called Dan on a Saturday evening, and he miraculously got our pre-approval letter by Sunday morning. Let me add that Dan just had a baby boy, and I know he was probably on 2-3 hours of sleep. This demonstrates  how committed he is to helping others fulfill their dreams in finding their perfect home!

<Review>Glad we used Daniel Patty when we did our refinance/cash out.  The process was smooth and informative.  There was no pressure to do anything we didn't want to do.  Much better than going to a big bank in our opinion.  You'll get a much more personalized experience coming here.  Also the documents and signatures were all online and very smooth.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>People’s home equity has been so wonderful to us, and helped us move into our new home. Sean, Sherry and Annette helped us. My husband was deployed during our move into our first home and it was so stressful for me, but somehow they made it manageable. People’s home equity cares about people and goes the extra mile.

Mr. Patty with Peoples Home Equity gives highly professional service with a personal touch. He's extremely knowledgeable in his field and gives sound advice. I would request him when I have any mortgage needs and refer family and friends. Thank you. You made the grieving of my husband less painful as you helped me navigate the mortgage process.</text>

Dan is the man! He handled the purchase of my home along with 2 refinances. I would not consider anyone else. He is fast and I always feel he has my back. Look no further....Dan will take good care of you.<//Text>

The Patty Team gave us the best experience a home time buyer could have. The process was quick and easy. Even thru what’s supposed to be the most stressful parts of the process, they made sure it went pretty smooth for us. Just 30 days after putting in an application we are now first time home buyers thanks to Dan and his team of professionals.< /text>

As first time homebuyers, we had a million questions about the home buying process, and needed someone who could communicate clearly, be extremely patient, and always act in our best interest.  Also, in this competitive market, we could only use the best of the best if we wanted our offer to be accepted and successfully close in a reasonable amount of time.  Thankfully for us, Dan surpassed ALL of our expectations!  He was there for us every step of the way - starting when we had no idea what homes we could put offers on, all the way up until signing our final paperwork with us!  If you want to have some peace of mind during the stress of buying a home, then Dan is the way to go! He lives up to every positive review! THANK YOU x a million DAN!!!</text>< Pictures>

Exceptionally rude and unprofessional service from the mechanic David Lopez. He was aggressive over the phone, he agreed on an appointment time and didn't touch the truck for 5 hours and then when finished, left the truck parked in the middle of the street. Literally, he left the customer's truck parked in the middle of a busy street in between the center divider. I have never experienced this level unprofessionalism. I do not recommend this mechanic at all. Take your business somewhere else where it will be appreciated.<//text>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHOP!! THEY REBUILT OUR DD15 ENGINE AND IT ONLY RAN FOR 30 MILES WHEN WE HAD TO TOW IT BACK TO THEIR SHOP BECAUSE THE ENGINE SUDDENTLY STOPPED. THEY PROMISED US THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT AND THEIR "WARRANTY" WOULD COVER FOR ALL EXPENSES.  TWO MONTHS LATER, THEY GAVE US BACK THE TRUCK AND SAME THING HAPPENED.  THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE!! WE'RE NOW FIGHTING WITH OUR BANK TRYING TO GET A REFUND FOR THIS INVOICE. PLEASE STAY AWAY! THE OWNER OCTAVIO PROMISED US THE WORLD AND IT HAS BEEN HELL EVER SINCE.<//Review>

< Review>
The crust is thin with a nice pillow-y edge. The sauce is very subtle (and I like that) and the cheese is melted evenly. The pizza was hella greasy (I like that too). It's definitely a classic American style pie. The website was easy to navigate and the pizza was ready to pickup before the quoted time. I suggest to check in early to get the best experience with texture. The price can not be beat!<//Review>

This place is a hole in the wall joint that has some really good pizza they have all different types of pizza and specials the quality is good their services fast especially on deliveries and even on pickups this is one of my go-to places. They have a lot of good takeout specials like a pepperoni pizza for $6 or a large pastrami Pizza for $10 they definitely have all different types of food such as wings strombolis sandwiches salads so there's definitely a variety you will not be disappointed< /Review>

<Text>I came here expecting to discover an unfavorable pizza experience. I was pleasantly surprised as my expectations were met, and then exceeded.

As a local, I can say this is one of the better pies in the area.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b6f660f86c0f:0x99cacbf27fe14894< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>NEW MILLENNIUM  PIZZA... ZERO ⭐️ To those clients who are ordering thru qMenu don’t do it stop 🛑 you will get your money taken away and will not receive your order I’ve had that experience myself just today 5/6/2020, and urge the public to be aware of what you are doing if you receive a qMenu code don’t use its just gonna make like if you placed that order but in the end you will not receive your order or asked to pay again because your card didn’t come thru, so please be very careful don’t use  qMenu
To place an order. I was literally taken away $50.00, so just be careful. Yeah at times like these you wouldn’t imagine something like this to happen.</Review>< Rate>

<time>1583987789208< /time><rating>1<//rating><review>March 11 around 7 my pizza arrived. Delivery man was very respectful and I even tipped him 5 dollars. The issue began after. I open the box after he leaves and the bread isn't cooked all the way and there is a bucket of grease in the centet of the pizza on top of the cheese. I called and complaint and the gentleman who answered said he will have the delivery man bring another pizza in an hour since o explained the pizza was not edible. I waited till 9 and I called. The same gentleman answered and after I explained who I was he hung up on me, I called 3 more times after and he refused to pick up. This is horrible customer service. If your buisness is going through such a financial struggle that you need to steal from your customers then you should atleast reevaluate your employees., If I could give 1 star I would.< /review>< pics>

Great tasting pizza was a little skeptical of a random pizza spot down the street from  pizza hut it was either pizza hut dominoes or this place ended up not ordering pizza hut or dominoes and decided on this place. Gotta say I made the right choice!! this pizza spot definitely is good it's in a random area a little greasy and i love it!!!! i feel like it ain't a real good pizza without a little of it on ur pizza ordered pepperoni and jalapeno they have really good prices on the food. Thanks again definitely coming here to this mom and pop pizza spot than a pizza chain again.</review>

<Review>I ordered a L pepperoni/sausage for pick up; under $10; ready in 15 min; absolutely delicious. The pizza had fresh cheese that was yummy; excellent soft but browned and bubbly crust. Could of had more of each topping, but I really enjoyed it and will definitely return.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This little spot is cool I loved the vintage arcade games and the good service. The wait was ten minutes but that pepperoni and cheese was freshly hand tossed and baked to perfection.  This is my first time eating out in Inglewood (I live in West LA)  if the rest of the resteraunts are like this... It looks like I better fill up the tank because I'm outchere😝😏😉 thanks guys!<//review>

<Text>Stop #177 for @pizzas365: New Millennium Pizza is a solid average pizza. You get everything you want and expect from a classic delivery pizza place, and it tastes pretty decent. The main downside is a bit too much grease for comfort. 3.8 Stars.< /Text>< user>

Worst pizza we've ever had! Tomato sauce was watery like a soup and not a sauce! This made the pizza crust soggy and not appetizing! So disappointed! The Tuscan tomato soup we ordered was the redeeming item on menu otherwise I would have given a one star. Staff was friendly and helpful.</text>

Hit pizza place up, "nothing we can do, call uber eats" they don't have a number btw. In the end I paid close to $25 for 1 pizza. Uber eats nor these guys owned up. It's a measly few dollars but it's the sting of paying for something you never got. I got suckered by these guys, for some chicken wangs!! Haha

The pizza itself was barely edible, it almost slipped out of my hands from how greasy it was. Little Cesars is better than this. Take your business elsewhere, this place is garbage.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The peperoni pizza is bomb, the cheese pizza is cheesy. The bbq pizza is delish. Service is the best and speedy. The problem is when you get to the cheese stix, the cheese stix taste frozen and flavorless. The pastrami pizza is plain out bad. It has too little pastrami, too much mustard, and not enough pickles. Once that gets fixed i will come back until then i feel i and owed a pastrami pizza... The bread sticks are alright too. Wings are good but a flavor variety is needed.<//text>

<Text>I ordered some skates but before I did I measured my foot and I reached out to customer service to confirm the best size for me to get.. well my calculations and customer services calculations about what size I should get were the same so I made my purchase I received the skates. Unfortunately they are too big.  They approved me for a return but say I would pay for shipping and they pay to ship back.. WHY am I paying double shipping for skates that are too big? I went off of their size charts and the advisement of a customer service rep when I selected my size so it does not make sense that I would have to pay to get the correct size.. I saw a bunch of bad reviews about this shop after the fact and I truly wish that I had looked before I leaped. The bad reviews stand out more than the good reviews and that is sad. I should not have to pay to exchange my skates unless I am upgrading which I was willing to do and pay the difference.. I emailed customer service about the issue of me paying to reship and no response back yet. If you order from here I suggest you try to sale the skates you ordered and shop somewhere else. I'm very dissatisfied.<//Text>< gmapID>

<text>Took way too long for a pair of "in stock" skates to be shipped. Customer service communications definitely did not make me feel like a valued customer. I regret apologizing for feeling like I was bothering them and somehow being annoyed for their terrible email response time. Then it took them forever to ship my order. I will not be shopping from them again in the future.

Furthermore, I ordered the Moxie Panthers, and the leopard toe caps didn't come with them. They did put in a crab tool, but it didn't fit any of my skate wheel or truck nuts, so I ordered another crab tool along with my Luminous wheels, from Eastern Skating Supply.

If you want fast shipping and more in stock choices go to Eastern Skating Supply online or RollerSkateNation.com. Both have excellent service and faster shipping.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Used to love them, but they offer zero help when a package goes missing so order online at your own peril. Also I bought a pair of Moonlight Roller's safety dance skates online from here a few months back and they were already opened (not even put back in the plastic baggies correctly) when I got them, which was shady and I shouldn't have let slide since I paid brand-new pricing for them.< /Text>

We originally went in for skates wheels and laces but the sales lady had bad energy which made me and my friends a bit anxious once in the store (Two hour wait to get in once on the list)

The Black Moxi Skates Are great unfortunately the tool or stickers did not come In the box which is a bit frustrating for the price you are paying you would expect everything to be included. I asked the sales lady to check to see if they had a pair in stock with everything included she walked to the back didn’t look at anything turned and walked back to me and said no. Like I did not see her walk 10 feet turn around and come straight back.

The lady who cashed us out and fixed the internet was great and the young Lady who took our name when we first arrive was extremely friendly. We really just had the wrong person help us which really did not make us feel good about spending money there.</Text>

Bought a pair of Beach Bunny Moxi skates from their online website. I am a new skater and had recently been using some cheap skates and decided to get these higher quality skates. They are AMAZING! My feet feel super supported while also not being so stiff that I can’t do tricks. This place is the only spot I could find Moxi’s, and with a great price for such a high quality shoe! (Even their own website was totally sold out!)

Super satisfied with my order. Because of covid it did take a bit longer to receive but still came a lot faster than I expected. Would love to check out the actual shop if I ever visit the area.</Review>

I ordered skates May 15, 2020. I had picked a different style than what I REALLY wanted because it said the others were on back order.  After about a month, I hadn’t received correspondence as to when I would be receiving them, so I emailed asking what kind of time frame I should expect. They said due to COVID-19 the manufacturer they get them from had delays since they had to shut down. Understandable. Another two weeks go by, I hadn’t received them, so I emailed July 5, 2020 asking if I could update the address for my order since I’d be moving. It was updated no problem the following day. Fast forward two months to September 7, 2020 still no skates, so I email asking for a refund because at this point I’ve waited almost four months for $314 skates. I don’t have a lot of money and they were something to gift myself for the hard work I do. I got an email back saying they were sorry *I* was having problems with getting my skates? I’m not having trouble with getting them, you’re having trouble with processing, shipping, and delivering. I wanted to support a small business, but it seems that they’re ill equipped to handle the volume of orders they’ve got. It was also stated that refunds take 3-5 business days to process, but to allow up to 10 before I should see my money back in my account. Okay, cool. I’m just happy to get my money back after not receiving what I paid for. No harm no foul, however, I get an email the next day saying the skates have been shipped. I’m confused. I email asking why they’re being sent if I said to cancel it and refund me. I’m told they didn’t receive the cancellation in time, so their supplier went ahead and shipped it. It’s odd to me that after waiting four months, suddenly my skates are being shipped when I ask to cancel the order and for my money back? I get another email a few days later saying the skates have arrived, I check, they’re not there. I email saying I haven’t actually received the skates. I’m told sometimes they say they’ve been delivered when they haven’t actually got there yet or that the carriers put them on the wrong doorsteps and to check my neighbors house. I live in the suburbs and have received packages easily every other time I get them. I’m also told to wait to see if they show up before they move forward to put out a claim. I’ve waited an additional week at this point, we’re also coming up to the five month mark. At this point it seems like I’m getting the run around and they don’t actually want to give me my money back. It’s also disheartening to see that there are others who were able to get refunds with no issue.<//review>

I ordered skates online the day after black Friday I believe. I really wanted to support this small business. I know some reviews said the shipping was taking forever but it seems they have caught up. My package shipped in a day or two and I received it a couple of days after that. Thank you guys for continuing to work hard during this time!<//text>

<text>Made two separate orders less than 5 minutes apart from each other, then emailed to ask if they could combine shipments. I got a prompt “no”, and had to pay twice for shipping. Okay, that’s fair. It was my mistake, but I feel that it’s easy to just put the items into one box and print one shipping label... anyway. Received both orders, one of which is missing two of the items I ordered. I did receive an email back and am being shipped my missing item.< /text>< pictures>

Excellent customer service! I ordered a pair of skates, six pack of pads and toe caps. Everything but the skates were at my house in a week. I emailed customer support because I found a pair of skates that would be at my home sooner than January. I got a prompt and friendly response from Millie and there was no issue with the refund. The website is very easy to use on a desktop or phone and I'll for sure come back for my future roller skating needs 😊</Review>

< review>
Ordered a few things while, like so many folks now, I wait for some new skates. I have been rocking some old derby skates at the skate park and wanted some new wheels to see if they make a difference. Shipment came as expected, and everything was included in my order, but my wheels that I ordered were the wrong size. Knowing how busy skate shops are, I emailed them to see what could be done. I got a email back right away with a prepaid return label. I was so shocked! I was really expecting to wait at least a week before I even got an email. I dropped off the wheels at the post office and 2 days later got another email thanking me for returning them and that they would send out the correct size right away.
Folks, this is how you do it. Kindness goes so long. I was ready for a wait. I would have been JUST as happy and appreciative if I didn’t get an email back right away because we are in a Pandemic right now. I’m so happy to have been contacted this fast but more impressed with how kind the customer service is.
I would like to say THANK YOU for working so hard during this unprecedented time to get folks little slices of joy into their lives.< /review>

Also have people waiting for months to get their orders (some never receive them) and then blame it on covid. As expensive as the skates are and the fact that people are trying to support a small business and y’all just scam them is sad.

I ordered online and was originally told the wait was 6/8 weeks. My skates finally showed up 17 weeks later. About 4 weeks into having my skates ordered I unexpectedly moved and had to change my address. They told me they changed the shipping address. After 16 weeks I finally get a notification saying they shipped my skates, but I notice it says it’s going to ship to my old address still. I emailed them again and they said that they “checked” the system and it was going to the right address. Well, guess where my skates ended up? 45 minutes away in a town/house I no longer live at 🙃 After paying $300 dollars for skates, I expected better customer service. They have yet to respond to my email concerning this issue. I’ll never waste my time or money with this company again.</text>

19 WEEKS WASTED. Very disappointed. I ordered skates in May and was told that there would be a 9-12 week waiting period. After two weeks, I got an email saying the skates I ordered are unavailable and I had to pick different ones which at least the offered a discount. 15 weeks later I get an email saying that I have at least 2-3 more weeks to wait. At this point I had already moved and just wanted my skates. Since they had no idea when they could be ready I requested a refund which they said would normally take 3-5 business days, but due to covid it was upped to 10. 15 business days later, I still do not have my money back. I was looking forward to supporting a small business, and I tried to be as patient as possible (and I have lots of patience). I have never been so disappointed by  a store. Please give me my money back.<//text>

Great place to buy indoor and outdoor rollerskates. Plus, if you already have skates they can switch out wheels. Don't forget to give a tip!<//review>

<Review>Order was received with the wrong product. Conversations with customer service took days at a time to get a response. Replacements for the right product were supposed to be shipped once the return was delivered to the post office, replacements did not ship until 5 days later. Given the extensive delay in the customer service teams response with updates the skates that were purchased as a gift did not arrive in time as promised by one of the multiple people that were part of the group email. Three weeks after the initial communication to address the error and there was still no resolution, no stock on the skates and no communication for return. I originally chose to order from this company to support small businesses but the lack of communication and length of time to get a response is not worth returning for future orders. For the same price the skates were ordered direct from the manufacture site and arrived before the replacement skates left the Pigeon facility.<//Review></record>

After seeing how Pigeon's Roller Skates Shop is taking advantage of Planet Roller Skates name, and how the company behaved on the Facebook Group and the actions subsequently taken, I chose to no longer support this unethical business.  Consumers need to understand what business they are supporting.< /text>

Came by for some new safety gear and a skate leash, and they had exactly what I needed! Just be prepared to WAIT, if you wanna go to the physical shop. I showed up this morning around 11ish. They can only help one person at a time, due to Covid and such. I started out as the 3rd person waiting in line, and it was about 40ish minutes before I was able to enter the shop and be helped. The staff was friendly and helpful. Not sure if there's any way to make the line go a bit faster?  All in all I'll be back💖</text>

<Text>Really great shop online. I ordered custom jackboots and they came so well put together, just ready to slip on and ride. The only complaint I have is I had bought some expensive wheels and they went on sale a few days after I bought them and when I asked if mine would be damaged they said no mine won’t be it’s just they yellow quick. Understandable but mine came very yellowed like something that sat on a shelf since the dawn of time, so just double check your orders. Because I was told one thing then got a defect item on full price. I’m not the type to fight over that and my wheels were going to get dirty anyways but that’s really important to some people, maybe they’re making a YouTube review. Other than that I really like this place.<//Text>< rate>

I was literally just there 5/17/19. The two women working there today were helpful and polite. they made sure the skate was comfortable on my feet and all the bearings were tight. if I had ordered online I may have gotten the wrong size or a poorly put together product which is dangerous when you don't know much about skates. so I am glad I went to Moxi and I love my new Roller skates. Even if your not sure you want to buy, its good to go in and try on some or get an idea of what you may or may not like, or get advice/tips for buying especially if its your first pair or if (like in my case),its just been a while(many many moons) since you've used a pair of roller skates.  I would highly recommend Moxie,  they're awesome!!!</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd310f283b8a79:0x555fc4cf7d59ce02</Gmap_id><review>Not a review ***just a comment regarding another comment I read that was from a not so happy customer. Regarding driving back and forth 45 min. And sending her teenage boys in to pick up the skates ..etc ... I was a little disappointed in the response from the store (keep in mind my opinion doesn’t matter..so don’t pay no mind to me). But people are going to leave bad reviews, there’s no way to avoid it. Replying to the comment was the right thing to do. The reply however lacked true customer service /professionalism . Let’s assume that she did send her teenaged kids into the store and that everything you said was correct...this isn’t the place to come back with attitude. Even if the customers wrong. Customer service  is about finding a remedy that pleases the customer. Customer service is not something that everyone should assume they can do .  While the person responding may have thought it the right way to respond, it’s not a good representation of what the store would want to project to the public.  Customers are wrong and customers are right and  it’s not the stores intention to disappoint a customer regardless. Striving to win back the trust of a customer and making sure they understand how you can help them best while saving them any more unnecessary drive time should be the top priority. That’s what the customer needs to hear Every customer should feel like they matter even when they are wrong. Not that she was wrong ... anyways I’m just saying. Having one person who is extremely patient and can be kind and calm no matter how rude someone is to them- well that’s who you should have respond to complaints- “kill em with kindness”  and not a sarcastic kindness ...a genuine kindness . That’s customer service . Quality over quantity.
P.s can’t wait to come to the store and shop and meet all you wonderful gals. Do you still do that thing where you meet up and go for a skate in the evening? I think I saw that somewhere posted?  Thank you .</review>< time>

So disappointed. I ordered skates from the on-line store even though there was supposed to be a 2 week wait for shipment because I wanted to support a small women-owned business. Well 3 weeks later I got an email saying that the skates I ordered were out of stock and my order was canceled. I had also tried for weeks to reach customer service to answer a simple question. My question was finally answered after my order was canceled. Because of this and after learning about what happened on their facebook group page, I won't buy from them in the future. Yesterday I ordered the same skates from another company for less money and they shipped today.<//review>

<text>I have been waiting for my skates for a month and I’m just wondering when they will come. They have yet to send a tracking number. I understand that the circumstances are different due the pandemic but I would just like to know how long it has taken other people to get their skates during covid because I am just confused on when I am going to get mine.<//text><pics>None<//pics></record>

<Review>Can’t vouche for the “awesome customer service” since it’s nearly impossible to get into the shop.

Online service on the other hand is horrible. It literally takes 3-5 days for any kind of response.

Return/exchange procedure feels like a nightmare.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd310f283b8a79:0x555fc4cf7d59ce02<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>While in LB on vacation from Lake Tahoe the Moxi shop was on my list of to do's!!! Hiding my fan girl excitement I was able to get lots of info and try on many different skates that aren't available to try on in Tahoe area. Great shop , top tier skates, with amazing staff and lots of glitter !!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I don’t understand the poor reviews.  But my visit today to the LB location was great.  The staff was tremendously helpful and I can’t wait to return.

I definitely recommend calling to ensure your size is in stock before visiting.</review>

Ok place,expensive fashionable rolling skates the only reason for 4 stars is that the seller person didnt check the wheels to light up correctly,one wheel doesn't work as supposed to work and that will cause me to go back to exchange it and that will cost me 2 hours of my life and some money in the top of the 325 paid for the rolling skates.<//text>

Whether your you enjoy roller skating outside or you are a competitive roller skater .... These boots are great.  These high end outdoor/indoor skates.  I skated for 26 years tried these on and feel in love.   My skates are on consignment right now so as soon as they sell I am going to put the money towards a new pair of "Lolly's".

Both times I have stopped in there the girls were great to talk to and share information.  Such a fun place to visit.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a good pair for Roller Skates for outdoor/indoor check Moxi Roller Skates in Long Beach.< /Review>

<text>HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!! I bought two pairs of shoes and took them to Moxi and they told me to leave the shoes there so they could fit the plates. WEEKS later I pick up the shoes, plates, and supposedly all of the parts, get home and I'm missing all of the nuts and washers. I drive back to Moxi and pick up the nuts and washers (45 min drive ONE WAY). When I get home I start assembling the skates and realize the PLATES that supposedly were custom fit, didn't fit at all. Instead of driving back, I grinded down the plates to fit and almost fully assemble both pair of skates and realize the TRUCKS are not all the same. I call the store and speak to a teenager who says "the managers don't hold normal business hours." She had no idea how to deal with this type of complaint and said"I'll leave a message for my boss." I asked if they had customer info on file to refer back to and evidently they don't log that info. I asked for the corporate office but evidently it's a small hole in the wall business. I left my number for the store manager to call me back. Four trips, 45 miles EACH WAY because they obviously don't understand "QUALITY CONTROL!!!" And chances of them accommodating me financially due to their screw ups is slim to none. So the two pair of skates will go back for a full refund and negative commentary placed in every review app known to man....... Including the better business bureau!!!!!</text>< pictures>

{'time': 1507063314109, 'text': "Sorry you are upset. It was your teenage boys who came in so I can understand that they did not communicate with you on what actually happened since you were not here. We told the teenage boys, who were the ones who came in, over and over it is best if we do the work/mounting/labor for them. They refused. It is a VERY delicate process that, if you research, IS NOT recommended for inexperienced people to do themselves. They refused to use our services to mount and wanted to do it themselves. Not knowing anything about metal insoles or mounting skates, I can see where they ran into a problem. Typically if a customer thinks something is wrong they don't modify the item but bring it back or call into the store and ask for help. Your teenage boys did not call in to ask for help nor did they purchase the nuts or washers but when they came in the 2nd time we gave them to them for free. Your sons were very nice boys but maybe you should go with them when they purchase specialty items that require assembly so you can have all of the accurate information when you want to write a review on their behalf.\nHave a nice day."}</resp>

< Review>
I am angry at customer service. I ordered toe stops in August and didn't get my item till September. I tracked my shipment and it wasn't even processed at all!!! When I message customer service, they said that they were going to ship it soon. Then weeks later, I tracked my shipment and it wasn't even processed!!!! I message customer service and they apologize for the inconvenience and offer a skate tool as an apology. After another week, I finally got what I ordered but no skate tool!! Customer service is not good at all! If you're going to go on vacation and backing up shipment, at-least put a notification on the website that orders are on delay instead of inconveniencing your customers who are wondering where the hell is their product that they ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't even know the office was closed for labor day for like a whole week and I'm over here wondering why its taking weeks after I got a message from customer services that my order was going to come soon!!!!!!

I am fully aware that the website is different from the store but there were no yelp website or anything else to review it on. If they are independently owned, they surely are making your company as a whole look bad. Suggestion, you should get a hold of them and better their customer service!!! Other than that, upset reviews will still come through because you guys selling the same product.< /Review>

< Review>
Customer service is absolutely terrible. Our family made a special trip to LBC to get my daughter some roller skates, pads, and a helmet and were very disappointed on how horrible one particular employee was toward us. Preconceived notions about the type of people we are — and who are potentional customers — and treating us poorly based on your bias is a poor business model to follow. We were fully prepared to buy skates for both myself and my daughter after months of waiting to come here specifically and it’s unfortunate to say we walked straight out based on how rudely we were treated by the one chick behind the counter, who made it very clear she didn’t want or need our buiness — so good luck.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1532870884284, 'text': 'Hello! Your review seems to be for moxiskates.com which is not our business. Moxiskates.com is completely independently owned from the physical Moxi Skate Shop that this review is showing up on. Im not sure how someone would write a review for a website as I’m not sure there is something like yelp for online store but can you please remove this review as it is not an accurate reflection of our business?\nAlso just a heads up preorders for handmade items aren’t like preorders for things made in China that come in bulk. I understand moxiskates.com or it’s counterpart on instagram @moxirollerskates (we are @moxiskateshop and our website is Moxi longbeach.com we personally don’t sell online) didn’t advertise well enough to let people know that release date was the first 50 handmade Honeydew which were preordered by amazon and other customers in February. Each week after that would cover another 2-3 weeks of spring preorders. If you ordered in June then your at the end of the chronological list of getting that hand made item. Just so you know that no one was pulling your leg or anything. All small businesses and skate shops have experienced customers who are confused on how handmade preorders work over made in China (example Nike shoes).'}< /Response><Rating>1<//Rating><user_name>Dasja Nappier<//user_name>< user>

< Review>
Great skates, but don't order them online directly from their website - go through amazon or something. I never post reviews about anything ever but I felt this needed to be said. This whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and makes me not even want to skate anymore.

I pre-ordered the green (honeydew) color on June 12th and assumed they would ship when the skates officially released (June 14th I think), because that's how pre-orders are supposed to work. I also ordered a set of trick wheels on or around June 16th.

The confirmation e-mail they send when you place an order says "it takes 2-3 business days to process your order once it has been placed and 2 days to ship," unless they're out of stock, then they'll notify you. The e-mail also says the skates can take 1-5 weeks to make if they're not it stock. I assumed I wouldn't have to deal with any of that because, again, I placed a pre-order.

On June 26th, 2 WEEKS after not hearing anything, I e-mailed them and asked if there were any updates. After e-mailing several times, I didn't get a response until July 2nd (a week later), and was told that if I ordered after April 1st the skates would ship out in the order they were purchased... That's doesn't sound like a pre-order to me.

On July 18th I was done waiting and proceeded to cancel my orders (both the trick wheels and the skates). I would order a different color through amazon instead. The trick wheel order was canceled the same day, the skates were not.

I e-mailed again on July 20th asking them to cancel my skate order. July 25th, I WAS TOLD MY SKATES HAD ALREADY SHIPPED AND THEY COULDN'T CANCEL THE ORDER. What!? That really pissed me off - you can cancel the wheels the same day but you wait until it's too late to cancel the skates? I honestly feel like they stole my money.

I finally received my skates on July 27th.

TL;DR - IT TOOK ME OVER 6 WEEKS TO GET MY SKATES, EVEN THOUGH I PRE-ORDERED THEM. Their customer service is sporadic at best - sometimes I would get an e-mail back the same day and other times weeks later - which ended up costing me hundreds of dollars for an extra pair of skates that I now have to send back to amazon (which I received in less than a week btw, shout out to amazon).

Thank you for reading, I hope this review helps someone.

edit: I'm sorry, but for the sake of visibility, I cannot remove this review. The online shop and physical store are connected as far as branding goes - it's all the same from a customer's perspective. I did also leave this review on yelp and have seen other reviews cross-posted in both places as well (about the online shop and the location).

Either way, I was not confused, I was mislead. On the website, the summer color listings had "pre-order" in the title until June 14th, which would lead anyone to believe they would get their skates just like any other pre-order up until that date. Moxi should've been much clearer about what a pre-order means for a small business with handmade items, as it is not common knowledge. They could've done that in a number of ways (ex. through social media, in the description of the listing, etc.), so there is no excuse. Thank you.</Review>

The owners are the most active owners I know. They skate daily, in the streets the beaches roller derby or as the ever so badass Moxi Street Team!! They KNOW what they are selling, they will never up sell you on items you dont need but will help you if you should have questions about said products. Going go the skate shop is like going to the Dr, you need to write out your questions, do your research on options and youll get educated at the same time!!
Skate services are offered here!! They can change out your plates for a small fee.
Check times and hours before driving out or give them a ring. 99% if they dont physically have it in stock they will order it for you, or its no longer in production.< /Text>

<Text>I found the company over the google. They gave me really affordable price for my attic and wall. El showed me whole process of job in detail such as how they cleaned attic, sealed air leakage, rodent proofing and put new insulation. They also fixed air duct for free  which was disconnected from bathroom.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7c0d317fcd5f:0x3077eca8820c153a<//Gmap_id></record>

Fun and affordable for families as well as groups. Happy Hour is daily from 3 to 6pm. Half off all wine and sake. Downtown Culver City nearly offers every type of cuisine now with this dim sum experience.</text>

< Review>
For flavors, it’s not your typical American Chinese restaurant. For interior design and service quality, it’s not a San Gabriel Valley Chinese restaurant. For food variety, it’s not just a dim sum spot that only has alluring food cart running around. It does not serve over spicy Sichuan food that make you sweaty throughout the rest of the meal.

For the most part, the food is authentic. I tried the dry pot which has the right amount of spice. The twice cooked pork is still somehow sweet. But I am fine with that since it’s still delicious. The dim sum is BIG and tasty. The green tea tiramisu is liked by everyone.

Haven’t found any Chinese restaurant that house itself in a warehouse. The exposed wood frame smartly relates to the traditional Chinese wood structure system. The nice space divider with Chinese brush painting on it, the peach decoration around the steel column, the golden lotus wall art and the panda chopstick stand. All are elegant Chinese symbols that make you feel you are a distinguished guest being invited by a royal Chinese family. Besides the good service experience we had. (The gentleman in the second picture is awesome)<//Review>

Maggie was incredible and had the best sense of humor along with great customer service..

Some of the best hot and sour soup I have ever eaten in my entire life.

I WOULD go back and order all of this again.
Tsingtao (beer)
Hot Tea Pot
Pork Xiu Mai
Pork Xiu Mai/Shrimp

<review>Let me begin by telling you this place is fanatastic. Never been here before, but I highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back. Came with a big group and ate family style.

I was in the mood for Chinese food, since it's been a long LONG time.

I used to live on the westside and would frequent the downtown Culver City area. Many restaurants have come and go over the years, and I remember this space being a different restaurant.
Painfully so - but he has good intentions. He found this place, and off we went.

Now - we were there on a Tuesday evening, and it was RAINING (nay, POURING with thunder/lightening) - so it was a little empty. Completely understandable. So service was great - since no one was there. I'm sure the service is on par on other busy nights too - but I cannot speak to busy times.

We were both starving - so we ordered WAY too much. Fret not - I took the leftovers and they heated up nicely. :)

We ordered the Scallop app, the Fifty One noodle dish, and a bunch of different Dim Sum.

Everything came out when ready - and it was fast and furious (again, being that it was rainy Tuesday night).

The only thing that was a little limited was the drink menu. I'm not much of a drinker in the first place, so that's not much of a problem.

This place is worth checking out. It's reasonably priced, and it'll save you the time to driving to the SGV for good Chinese food.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

New Ownership!  This isn't your basic greasy American Chinese food. Will be back, the design inside is beautiful.

I love the grit here, the team behind Ooak (the previous brand) saw that the concept wasn't working. So they made the tough choice to rebrand and hire a whole new team. The new team seems to know what they are doing! This week Aug 2018, a new menu and fresh ingredients are being added to the mix.  We tried a few dishes days before the new menu took shape, and plan to go back again.

Hoping i can raise my review to 5 stars soon. We tried the spicy green beans, tofu lettuce wraps, and mushroom kung pao. Lettuce wraps were great, but Kung Pao was a little one sided, just peanuts and mushrooms, flavor was good though.<//text>

Four Stars for the Food Only.
Came here with another couple for dinner. Although the online Resy app stated nothing available, I called and was able to save a table over the phone.

Service: Poor. Upon sitting down, the waiter walks up and immediately asks us to order. We hadn’t even opened the menu QR code or anything. Then, when he returns, we ask for a suggestion of how much food would be the right amount for our table, his response, “I don’t know. Don’t ask me. I have no idea.” Once food was delivered, only came back once to check, never offered another round of drinks. Never topped off our waters. Basic points of service ignored.

Ha, if the wait staff doesn’t know, then who would? He then just walks away for a bit longer. We finally order food and drinks and all plates come as they are ready, so be advised that plates will not be portioned out.

Food: Very good! Ordered :
Wasabi shrimp, walnut crispy shrimp, crispy honey chicken(comes dry with some sauce on the bottom of the plate, should be tossed in the honey sauce).

Crispy sea bass- just bland fried pieces of fish.
Chinese Green beans: sooo good! Recommend!
Cantonese Duck! Favorite dish of the evening! With vegetables and soy paper to make wraps or tacos with!< /text>

The food was good, but the male waiter with a European accent was extremely rude. Won't be returning again.</Text>

<text>I dined here one Sunday evening, and it was such a pleasant experience. Food was fantastic, service was great, ambience was awesome. All around wonderful experience. A week after, remembering how good the food was, I ordered food to go. I ordered the same dish like what I have ordered the week before. When I got home, I was surprised the dishes were missing the ingredients that are mentioned in the menu (I ordered Fifty One Noodle with mushroom, and there was no mushroom at all, and fish kids menu with white rice, and no white rice in sight). I called the restaurant about this, and the lady who answered my call told me the kitchen is in the middle of changing the menus, thus the missing mushroom and white rice, and basically gave me too-bad-so-sad attitude about my complaint. Well, don't put it in the menu if you're going to give incomplete dishes. Overall, the food is great, but they could have handled their paying customers and complaints better.</text><user_id>116299674117193507001< /user_id>< resp>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Food was tasty and prepared well. Portions are much smaller than the usual Chinese restaurant we normally go too. Their soup was about 6oz. We got our fill by ordering Chinese dim sum which, is half price between 3-6pm all week. The interior decor is very nice and had clean restrooms. They have a very nice enclosed seating area for a large group. Table settings are very nice and there is plenty of seating with a full service bar. This restaurant has been opened 9 months and is in mid town of Culver City. The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived at 3:30PM. Our only disappointment was that our server forgot 2 items that we ordered and had to be reminded twice. For that reason they received our 3 star rating. Next to the preparation and taste of the dishes, the service is one of our highest requirements. A pay parking garage is across the street which was handy.<//review>< Rate>

Nice ambiance and good service. It's not the most authentic Chinese food but it's quite good and reasonably priced. Definitely a good option for a larger group getting dinner in the area.</Review>

This is a great place to satisfy your dimsum craving without having to drive all the way to the east side of town. We have been here a handful of times since they’ve opened. The quality of service depends on how busy the restaurant is. But they have been making steady improvements in this area. Prices are decent especially during Sunday’s when the dimsum is half off. If you haven’t tried this place yet, give it a try, you won’t be disappointed.</review>

Hot pot (with fish) and lobster tail dry-pot were delicious. Additional lobster tail for 5.20 is a great deal. They had a promo for lobster when I went there this week, ask for it.</Text>

This is a relatively new place. The food is really quite good. I had the honey ribs and they were to die for. The staff is really friendly. Our waitress keptnus laughing all night. Seems like a very friendly place for groups or families.</Text>

The waiter was great, but the food was a joke.
Fifty one noodle: it was literally just the 99 cent store spaghetti with ground beef and chopped up carrots. No flavor, just those three ingredients.
Garlic rib: No flavor! Dry! Nosauces added, just the plane rib fried without adding anything.
Lobster dumpling: A joke! The ”dish” smelled like a sauna, and the lobster was clearly frozen without additional flavoring.

The service and wine was phenomenal, but I would never recommend this place to anyone. 0/10</Text>

51 is the place to go for a good Chinese Restaurant.
Small Menu, but any choice of dish you cannot go wrong.
Nice surrounding and ambiance.
Relaxing and comfortable.
You don't want to est go for Tea Treat. Beautiful Ceremony.
A great addition to Culver City.
A must.<//review>

We stopped by Fifty One for a quick drink last night (08/21/2019) for Third Wednesdays.  It was the FINALE of the Tropical Staycation Event.

We had about ten people in our group and there were a lot of other participants waiting and excited to taste what Fifty One had to offer.

Well... unfortunately they ran out...we were super bummed that they ran out of the drink pretty early on in the event

This was one of the only stops that stopped serving, not sure how that happened as we were at other stops later on in the night that were still going strong that were even more crowded.

Cool that they participated but unfortunately I guess it was a miss for the night.<//review>

The restaurant is nice. I am not sure about the food. The eggplant was deep fried and I wasn't told they said it comes with basile but I didn't see any. Congpow chicken tasted not as good as other restaurants.</Text>

<text>The interior decor is great. The  price is very reasonable, too. However, the food is horribly prepared. The vegetables were so over cooked that the color turned into blackish yellow. In general, every is dish is sub standard. In fact, it’s the worst Chinese food I have ever had.<//text>< GmapID>

Fifty One is perfect for a rainy afternoon. Their steamed bao and dumplings have the perfect consistency, texture and flavor. We had their pork bao, chicken curry Fifty One and pork dumplings. The price is unbeatable for the flavor and quality! Both employees were kind and we were able to view them prepping the dumplings which took less than 10 minutes! We will be back !< /review>

Food was tasty and in great quantity. Be sure to ask for their in-house soy sauce, and I recommend the sesame balls for desert.
The 3-star rating is for one reason:
1) DO NOT get the duck. Comes in a vat of broth which is cool, but it's big and you have to stand up in order to get any food. Also, you have nowhere to put the bones when you are done, and there is no real way to cut the meat from the breast as they don't provide a knife. Ended up making a mess on the table. There is no true taste on its own, but the in-house soy sauce makes up for it.
Aside from the duck, a good place to eat!< /review>

Just loved it... Went out for a lunch with my colleagues and really like the ambiance and the staff was really nice too.... Dimsums here made to order so takes about 30 minutes but totally worth waiting for. Tried fried rice and that was very good too and hey for 8 people the bill was just $95. Definitely recommend the dimsums and fried rice here.< /Review>

Eh. The decor is nice. The food does not live up. The signature noodle dish named after the restaurant is pork and peanuts over spaghetti noodles. Package spaghetti noodles. Not fresh pasta. (Try rough cut hand made pasta it might hold the sauce which was the  best part). The owner/manager in the dining room on his computer doing books. Apparently complaining about the price of pork. Leaves me to believe he is cutting corners somewhere. Tea served in a coffee cup not a pot, and no coffee. Server was nice but ya just don't feel like they care ( I mean the whole restaurant )   Not going to get a second chance from me. Sorry.<//text>

< Review>
Food was tasty and in great quantity. Be sure to ask for their in-house soy sauce, and I recommend the sesame balls for desert.
The 3-star rating is for one reason:
1) DO NOT get the duck. Comes in a vat of broth which is cool, but it's big and you have to stand up in order to get any food. Also, you have nowhere to put the bones when you are done, and there is no real way to cut the meat from the breast as they don't provide a knife. Ended up making a mess on the table. There is no true taste on its own, but the in-house soy sauce makes up for it.
Aside from the duck, a good place to eat!</Review>

<text>Our new favorite discovery! Dim sum is really good and quite filling. Its bigger than traditional Chinese restaurants and surprisingly juicy and on par with the top notch places. LOVE their 50% discount on dim sum on sundays, makes it an extreme value compared to many other places. This is also a great location given that I dont have to drive all the way to Chinatown.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Most weird fake Chinese food I've had (especially the spicy sour soup), and lots of non-sense words on the menu. Only the dim sums were good probably because they got it from somewhere else<//review>

Just had dinner here today with a colleague. We had the yangchow pork fried rice, was good, and then we ordered a few dim sum, lobster dumplings, shrimp and chicken dumpling, char siu Bao and the shrimp Shu Mai. Which was all ok, and for two people this was a lot of food and we had leftovers. The food was good, and the ambiance was nice.</Text>

I was told to skip the dim sum but I had to order the pork shrimp Fifty One just so I can do a fair comparison with other Chinese places in the city. My friend was right again - the dim sum here was mediocre and seemed a little pricey.

Parents were in town and, craving Chinese, picked this spot. We'll start with how they're notoriously high maintenance so kudos first to the staff who were all kind and accommodating (not to mention surprisingly young/diverse/attractive,) especially given we had 2 kids in tow. Final verdict? Good for Chinese-fusion-esque sort of cuisine. And the prices really are pretty reasonable. It's also really inside, a little oasis of sorts.

It's in the heart of downtown Culver City; not sure how I've missed it right next to Rush Street all this time but all in all, I was satisfied. We tried multiple dishes on the menu. Dim Sum was actually tasty, and are available for dinner: prepare for large versions of Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and Shumai (your choice of chicken or pork), and the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) were actually decent.

Some interesting renditions of some dishes: Orange Chicken is served 'deconstructed' - fried slices of chicken (like chicken katsu) with the orange dip on the side. Chicken soup served with chicken on the bone on the side. The sauteed shrimp in tea leaves was one of my favorites. Even the desserts were good - sesame balls were authentic, fried coconut eggroll was warm, crispy, and hit the spot.

For just over $200 we fed 5 adults and 2 kids and had plenty of leftovers.

Only gripes? 1) They explicitly state on the menu (even the one published online) that they give 10% off your bill if you leave a 5 star review on yelp or google. Not a fan of high ratings solicitors. 2) The charge for tea was high for what it was. $6 a pot and not like you had a choice of what kind of tea. Because we thought we were making a generic ask like in authentic Chinese restaurants, we thought it was complimentary - oops.< /Text>

More like Fifty One Minute Wait. After an hour waiting with no food our first dumplings arrived, and the meat was cold on the inside. After 1h40m, we still hadn't recieved all of our dishes yet and asked for the check, and they still tried to bill us for food we never recieved and the sketchy cold dumplings we returned. The whole time they kept apologizing and saying the kitchen was busy, but most of the tables were empty. They shouldn't promote dim sum if they can't prepare it in a timely fashion.</Review>

This place does not deserve any stars at all!

We dropped in after the movie festival for a client meeting.

Overall.

This place was horrible!

The pineapple fried rice was cold....

How in the world can fried rice be cold...

1.Servers were not attentive,
2.Food was coming out late.
3.No utencils despite of multiple request
4.Have to ask for water again and again
5. The place was not even busy or crowded.

I was about to complain but as soon as I saw the check with additional tip included(party of 5+)

After unprofessional service I just gave up.

Iast night was a disaster!<//Text>

We ordered a variety of dim sum dishes along with a couple of other dishes off the regular menu. The vegetarian dim sum wasn't so great; we had potstickers and egg rolls that were too oily, and the potstickers barely had any filling inside. My favorite item that was actually worth the price was the jumbo pork xiu mai--it was definitely jumbo sized and quite filling! I also liked the spare ribs and the way they served it over rice. I'm a huge xiao long bao fan, so I'm pretty critical of XLBs everywhere I go. The XLB here is quite juicy, but the skin is too thick and all the dumplings were stuck together when they served it (making the skin break and all the juice spill out). We also tried the garlic lobster glass noodles, which tasted delicious but was overpriced considering the small portion size.

Service was good. The staff was very friendly and checked on us every now and then. Even though they mentioned that some dishes would require a bit of time to prepare, everything came out pretty quickly.

Overall, the food here tastes decent but is overpriced. However, this is a good spot for dim sum when I don't feel like driving out to SGV.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Hideously overpriced Chinese food.

The har gow and shu mai are huge, as are the lobster dumplings, but they're also priced accordingly. And the kitchen is a bit slow.

Tasty enough if you don't want to drive to 626, but the price isn't worth the convenience.<//Review>

<review>The food at Fifty One is very good, though the portions are small for the high prices. The wait staff is friendly, but can be absent minded. I waited a half an hour after everyone else in my party was served for my entree to be delivered, their signature Fifty One Noodles. The noodles were good, but not worth the wait.</review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Surprisingly, this place was pretty good! I grew up in a Chinese household and have had traditional shanghainese/cantonese food my whole life, and I really didn't expect this place to be authentic because it's in such a hip part of Culver next to the Arclight theater.

The dishes came in larger than expected portions and it never felt like they sacrificed quality for volume. The dry-pot dish is a specialty as is the tea-leaf shrimp. It's really cool that this place pulls dishes from different regions across China and pays homage to the regions by referencing them in the menu for people who are curious. Would recommend coming in groups of 4+ to have a good variety of food family-style.

Honestly, I'd bring my Asian parents here for a family meal and I'd be confident they wouldn't complain about the authenticity. It's not at all the same experience as going to a 626 seafood banquet hall - it's tastefully modern and smartly approachable for non-Asians. The whole place was spacious with tall ceilings and it's great for dates, gatherings, or family time. I even saw a banquet-ish table at the back which could probably fit a dozen of people and was semi-walled off with a wooden panel.

DEFINITELY make a reservation if you can, the place does get crowded and wait times can be 30+ during normal peak hours.

4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because I want to see more authentic Chinese places in the west side.< /Text>< pics>

First time there, food very good, wait staff little inexperienced for a Saturday night. Orders were not known what they were as they were brought to the table, restaurants own devices to keep food warm were not known how to use once at the table, and was not understood what it meant to share dishes between patrons and what types of dishes work well to do that.< /Text>

Tots very good too, and the price is good for overall good portion of food. Find a better location, cut the goofy music, and a little more professionalism and you’ve got a phenomenal burger business in your hands.<//Review>< Pictures>

I Saw this Burger pop up and decided to try their Burgers

They pitch their tents and cooking appliance on the SouthEastern corner of Balboa and Northoff on a corner of the Mobil Gas Station (Balboa side)

The Brick Burger consist of 2 Patties, they flattened them so the patties overflow from the buns, they normally come with cheese but I don’t like cheese so you won’t see it in the pictures, I ordered their 2 burgers for $11 special, I also ordered their tater tots for $6, you will get approx 31pcs per order,

The burgers we good and tater tots was nice and crispy, I just wish they were cheaper😜

There were 2 People working (cook and cashier, they were pretty nice

Just be aware that they tend to go them if it is windy.</Text>

THIS PLACE IS CLOSED - Drove all the way here at 1:15pm and they aren't ready to serve. Guy said 25min?!? So your not open at 1pm change your hours. Other people were here as well and had their time wasted. False hours, lackadaisical employees, and wasting people's time will keep your business in a Gas Station. If I was the boss of this place and I'm losing profits because we can't open on time then I'm revamping my whole staff. Clearly the owner or owners here don't give a flying fudge.< /review>

<review>This place is amazing!!!! I didn't believe the hype about this place and once I tried it-I don't know if I can find a vegan burger as good as this one. Also, get their animal style fries!!! They are absolutely amazing. The strawberry lemonade is also pretty refreshing! The place is a little bit more on the expensive side but it's honestly worth it. Parking is tough as well, but again it's worth it. And I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to amazing vegan food. I'm excited to come back. It's the best< /review>< Pics>

They make one thing, and they make it well! It's like the best version of a fast food burger. Just... don't expect anything else. Also, because it's a parking lot stand, problems pop up: the power might go out, or the credit card reader, they might run out of food and close early without any notification, there might randomly be a huge wait... It's always a bit of a gamble. But if they're open, the burgers are consistently good!< /Text>

So this place is the best vegan burger made in the world. I can go into detail but honestly, it's just the best. Even if you don't typically go for vegan food, Brick Burgers's is the real deal.</Text>

My first experience here was amazing. Staff had just started opening when they had an issue with their meat delivery. They were on top of it with letting everyone waiting know what was going on while offering a drink while we wait in sun. We waited about 20 minutes and ordered. Before we had ordered they had said not to worry about paying because of the wait. Once we got our food it was so delicious, but I was completely flabbergasted with how kind to their customers they were right off the bat. They went above and beyond just for the few of us waiting. We have came a couple times since, and have recommended friends to go try.< /review>

I REALLY want to give this place a 5 because the burgers r AWESOME. I mean we drove from Sylmar to get them. The reason I can't use only because of the long wait. I think we waited about 45 minutes for our order. I did notice that a lot of people call ahead orders so maybe we'll do that next time. I highly recommend that they hire more help though because the burgers are AMAZING.<//text>

I’ve been coming here since they first started this little pop up. It’s really delicious burgers along with polite and great service. They only serve burgers which are really good. They have chips and drinks also. Aren’t here when there’s a chance of rain or on some holidays. But I come back all the time cause it’s great burgers.</review>

They are ok
The beef patties is very thin
They have a kind of in N out flavor
But they don't put lettuce, no tomato, very basic style
Basically just put ketchup, mustard mayo and basic things
And the fries are served in a small red disposable cup and the price is $5.00 each. 😫😒
I am doing this to see if they can change the menu or prices<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Not gonna lie -- this was a pleasant surprise! It was recommended to us by my husband's coworker and we decided to try it! No regrets! It's really delicious -- no frills, just a mean old double patty (skinny ones) burger with their special brick sauce that really hit the spot. The sauce is like a little smoky, bacon-y (or at least that's what I thought), and just overall delish! This easily gets rid of In N Out from my to-go burger places. We will definitely be coming back! LOVE IT!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Absolutely delicious and really inexpensive. Best burger in the valley, by far. These guys do one burger: a nice, sightly spicy double meat double cheese smash-style burger, yum. Order two and enjoy<//Review>

I came right before their "parking lot" party ended. The band sounded great a mile away. It looked like a good time. The next one is in September so hopefully I'll see you then.< /Review>

The station is "hidden" in an upstairs suite,  located in a business area of town.  You could easily drive right passed it several times (like I did), before noticing it.  The office is very clean and they give you free KCAL (&/or KOLA 99.9) stickers upon request.<//text>

<review>Looking for a pint while walking through the city? Then stop here. Been walking all day with my wife and found this Irish oasis. Plenty of space in the alley to distance. The seating inside was also spaced appropriately. Beer choices were plentiful and chilled just right. A perfectly poured Guinness is just what you need to lift your spirits also. This is a must visit when in town.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnsxhiOvzIcE-W1vK_edhoLb9nAA9SD0wGdGZ_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO79zUBf6_ipI3_QakkrKE9KzH9cob7A-DLmBxp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPusRI1ikDlaW86jLP3EYRL_-xAsPl6CCkCeN8p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>The “Legendary” Irish Bank. Great place for gatherings and food. The drinks are good and reasonably priced. The food is authentic and delicious. Bangers and mash is my personal fav. Considering the times, their outside space is perfect. Many good times were had here throughout the years. Glad to see they’re surviving. Dos rounds up 🥃🥃🍺🍺< /text>< Pictures>

<date>1616038193225< /date><review>We went on St Pats day and I was just walking to see how it looks and the guy snapped at me saying im not supposed to walk and be here. He behaved like I must have pushed myself in and grabbed a few free drinks!! Please relax, i was just walking to check out the bar!They all say we should support small business especially in these covid times but then why should we when the staff behaves so rude!Now that people are coming in, they dont need to be nice..all the niceness was there only when there was lockdown and they needed business. There was a long wait but the staff did not follow the list and rather gave the tables randomly to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

I love the inside of the Irish Bank and I love the food, the whiskies and the bartenders. But I really love the alley. It is such a unique way to eat and hang out with your friends.<//review>

Ok Irish bar but our server kept forgetting requests like hot sauce for the quesadilla and additional beer orders. She was kind of snippy and didn’t apologize. Prices are reasonable.< /Review>

We enjoy going out. Yesterday we went to this magnificent restaurant which friends told us about. We had a beautiful time there with excellent food and a nice team and a talented  chef. We put this place in our phone list  and we will no doubt visit again very soon.  Highly recommended.<//review>

On a warm sunny day it's very nice sitting outside. They have nice Shepard's pie, and enough options for food and beers. The impossible burger is nice. Good service.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085808970c3e43b:0xe17d380c1e7aede8</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Good vibe and friendly staff are what the Irish Bank has going for it. Drink prices are ok by SF standards. The music was a bit loud for a pub, making it difficult to visit.</Text><date>1545020900788<//date></record>

<Review>Visited recently on a work trip with some colleagues, dropping by just as it was getting dark. We took a table outside in the alley (much nicer than it sounds) and started off with drinks. The drinks were good, price was reasonable. Food is standard Irish pub food, good quality. Our waitress helped me acquire some curried chips which was a nice touch.

Overall, it's a good bar/restaurant, serving good quality food and they don't cheat on the drinks either, or water them down as far as we could tell. And we conducted a thorough test. Definitely recommended for an evening, or to drop in after work.

Pro tip: The bouncer/assistant/maitre'd who greets you when you walk up and helps you get a seat, looks EXACTLY like a customer so we didn't recognize at first that he worked there and tried to walk past him. But he was a good guy and fine about it.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN01mFVNpPxrESeh_ZN_MwclsfKrKHe9rHYjhI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

One of the most authentic British pub in SF. Their fish and chip is to die for. Bring back good memories from London.< /text>

I didn't actually make it inside, but I went to the block party they put on for St. Paddy's Day 2018, and it was awesome.

Headlined by the Quiet Men who are an excellent Bay Area Irish rock band.

The whole place was packed and rocking all day.<//Review>

It's a good place. The appetizers have a fair price and there's a good amount of options. Nice list of beers (on tap and bottled) and, of course, you'll find a Guinness.<//Review>

Got to the bar and had prompt service. Good fish tacos, even with a minor mistake with my “hold the...” request. Probably a bit overpriced, but the atmosphere an Irish pub should have (well, an American urban version).  Excellent bar staff. Worth visiting.</review>

<Review>Great spot with a great vibe! If you are passing through or walking around please stop in for a beer. We did not eat any food but we had a couple of beers and a Dark and Stormy ZX everything was awesome. The waitress was friendly and even though it was packed outside she was able to help everyone out.
Thanks Irish Bank for a great memory!<//Review>< Pictures>

Great food and friendly service! The decor and location of the bar makes it a real unique spot to visit in San Francisco. All the food that we ordered was good and the Guinness pours were excellent.<//text>

< Review>
Been in there a few times, it’s decent everything, food is decent but the same girl service was extremely poor towards me compare to others around First time food thrown at me and super rude about 3 month’s back, yesterday I just wanted a soda but just had card, I said leave it open but she went on to say it will cost us too much as the card company fees would not be enough to cover the sodas I wanted. I was about to leave as she continued talking about it for a minute before a lady at the bar said she would cover me. She was very friendly with the lady after but I would never set foot In there again< /Review>

Most favorite place in San Francisco. Food is amazing no matter what you order or when you order. Breakfast food is good. Lunch and dinner have the same menu but everything is amazing. It can get loud in the evening when it gets busy but that just adds to the effect. Service is fast and friendly.<//review>

<text>The service was OK and the food was mediocre.  We sat outside and was able to enjoy some great weather.  The outdoor seating is nestled back in an alley with some neat memorabilia to look at.  I had one of the cocktails on the list which was better than expected.  I would come and likely will be pleased knowing what to expect.<//text></record>

The place is very unique, it's like being at a European cafe, but in San Francisco. It has a lot of character, the staff is super friendly and efficient. The beer selection could be better but it's not bad at all. The food was very average, but I only had an appetizer. And I'm not aware of any parking space available, street parking in this city can be very challenging.<//review>

<text>Quaint atmosphere, yet lively and fun without being boisterous & raucous. The bartender (I don't recall her name) was very personable & professional, & made great food and drinkv recommendations. Finally, the prices were definitely reasonable for a downtown SF establishment! I'll definitely be back!!<//text>< user_name>

<Review>I have a ton of love for the Irish Bank. It's rare to find a spot that's low key with great staff. I wish the food was just a little better and that the beer list had just one or two more diverse options... But overall, how can you go wrong with fish n chips and a Swithwicks?<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXfdioH6C0wuk3iHqYpWfuyXLZBOZPphPaa9tY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Solid Irish pub. Plenty of in and outdoor seating, and there were at least two groups of six when I was there so space is not an issue. The food was standard pub fair, but very generous! I had the mac and cheese one night and I came back for chicken tenders and cheese fries another night. Everything was excellent. Cider selection wasn't superb, but they have a crazy number of beers and a great wine list<//review>

We went on St Patrick's day so space was extremely limited, but they had a fantastic band playing and the bartenders were surprisingly good given the crowd. The only reason I'm giving them 4 of 5 stars was the sheer amount amount of people. I would give then 5 of 5 on a less busy day.<//review>

Drinks were okay.  Not much room by the bar even when not many people are in the establishment.  Someone bumped into me causing me to spill a bit of my drink.  He didn't even say anything and just kept going.  Not a very good crowd. Not sure why we went here.< /review>

<Text>It's in the alley!!!!! So seriously, saw the sign and came back after a day of sight seeing, to thinking they changed to a Korean restraint and just never changed the name, LMAO! Went to another bar, had the conversation with the bartender who set us straight! Was a fun experience! Drinks are great! Try a lemon drop Martini. One of the few places that carry dark beer as well 😉. Of course being an Irish pub, you should expect anything else 🙃</Text>< Rate>

Great bar in the financial district. They offer outside and indoor seating areas. They have a great selection of beers on tap. Did not have the food, but the wings and burgers looked great. Will definitely come back when back in San Francisco. Next time will try the food.</Text>

The folks that work there are super!  The food is good, and sturdy.  The prices are a bit high like the rest of downtown, but if you need a break, and a drink, it's worth it.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>We wandered in on a cool February afternoon and we were delighted to find a large number of vegetarian options. The vegetarian shepard's pie was delicious, the chips were great, and the lone employee we saw was just the right amount of friendly (polite but not fake-chatty like a lot of servers). The quiet and slightly dark atmosphere was nice, too.< /text>< pics>

<Review>My wife and I were forced to walk out of your establishment. We couldn't get any one to help us. The bartender wouldn't get of his phone with his back to us. He would look over at us then just go back to his phone. A man in the back did the same. Would look at us then run and hide in the other room. The owner might rethink his help. Maybe paying customers aren't something they need on Sunday</Review>< Pictures>

It was a bar, in an old Irish bank. Nothing overtly Irish but they had nice bartenders, cold beer, music, whiskey, and a strong locals presence. My fish and chips were tasty, but nothing unique. Good solid choice for a drink and pub food.</Review>

<review>I used to come here on regular days and St.Patrick festival. Great block party every year.
Yesterday I ordered Jameson and Stella beer, it was $16 in total. After an hour I ordered the same things again, this time price was $18.

When I asked explanation he confused and answered: "no, no this is the correct price"
I didn't believe it. Check what you pay.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

A few TVs for the sports fan (big screen for big events but arrive early for a table and bring ID) and some basic wine choices but this is really a beer and homemade food place.   Irish stew or shepherd's pie are good choices along with their fries.  No easy parking but just half a block from the Chinatown Dragon Gate.  Takes cards but also has an ATM.  Lots of outdoor alley seating but plenty of tables inside too.<//Review>< Pictures>

Excellent Irish pub in a secluded setting. I love coming to the Bank because of it's location and they have some good grub. They have a good selection of Irish and English ales and lagers, and it's a good place to go for groups.<//text>

I had been wanting to go to the Irish Bank for a while and finally had the perfect excuse. Very authentic old Irish pub in the middle of SF. The bar was impressive with all sorts of beers, bourbon, whiskey and more. I really liked how casual it is and the friendly environment. I wish it was closer to home in Hayes Valley as we need more casual and friendly bars like this one. Now I know where to go in Downtown for a good beer and glass of Bourbon. Cheers!</review>

Food menu looks good, but seriously, put some sauce on the burger so it's not so damn dry!! Beer selection good, staff friendly, fun crowd.</Review>

A properly poured Guinness! Good after-work beer spot for the Financial District crowd. A few TVs with local sports, and they pull out big screens for Euro & World Cup matches. Outdoor seating in the adjacent alley is in the shade, so best during warmer months. Chicken tenders surprisingly good.</text>

<Review>Cool poppin pub in a good location. They have Guinness, Harp, and Smithwick's on tap! It can get pretty noisy in there and it's fairly dark. I didn't eat anything. I was mostly excited about my beer. $10 card minimum, my beer was $7.< /Review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

Irish pub as an Irish Pub should be. Brown, lively, lot of locals, fantastic terrace outside where it is still allowed to smoke(!). Unique in a city like SFO. Good pub food, nothing fancy, just good. Friendly and proffesional staff.< /Text>

<text>Perfect place to stop for Irish pub food when you are in a bind at 10:00pm. The Irish stew is not bad at all - definitely a better batch here than other pubs in the city. Bar staff drew a smile when I asked for Bulmers and then realised I am stuck in the US. Its grand, they have Magners in a glass bottle. 5-stars for the epic bartender drinking grape Pedialyte in  the back while on an ibuprofen regimen. We’ve all been there bro.<//text>< Pictures>

A hip and up and coming place, with a long history, that is great for an intimate date or a young crowd.  It could be a very romantic place, but the atmosphere was more robust and energetic (as you would expect in an Irish pub).  Our waitress was sociable and the meals a decent size.  Some cool 80's music was playing in the background and noise from the TV's in the bar were audible; a pleasurable experience so much better than the typically dead atmospheres of other restaurants I've been in. A hidden gem in San Fransisco. 5 stars.</text>

They have an awesome alley to hang out in, and the bartenders/bouncers are always really nice.  Servers are hit or miss, but they're always kind of slammed so I understand that it's not their fault that management probably isn't  staffing correctly.<//Review>< username>

No service. After we walked in and were told to find any seat there was no one for 15 minutes until we went and asked only to learn you make all orders at the bar. Oh gun then I'm the waiter.....and I left a tip for that!

Atmosphere Is good but service is non existant.< /review>

<Date>1460071936310< /Date><text>This rating is mainly for the atmosphere and the fact that I love drinking here. The staff is usually attentive enough to ensure your drink is full. The food is decent pub food (nothing mind blowing) and the prices aren't terrible considering the location. They serve a great Guinness too. The atmosphere both inside and out are where its at! Great outside seating for those awesome SF nights, and a traditional pub atmosphere inside. Overall just a great place to grab a pint.<//text>< pics>

Really fun place to have some drinks. Location is tucked away which is nice but it can get very busy especially if there is an event going on in the city. One of my three favorite Irish pubs in the Bay Area, I highly recommend it.<//Review>

<review>Food's pretty good (we got the beef stew and the bangers with beans and mash, both were tasty but served kinda...lukewarm). Beer selection is okay, a bit subpar for what you'd expect at an Irish pub. Decent selection of American, scotch, and Irish whiskies. Good place to sit outside when the weather's nice. Overall, a solid neighborhood pub.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I love this pub! I come to SF at least once a year and undoubtably The Irish Bank is one of my first stops. The staff is great with a lot of great draft beers. They also serve great food and they have HP sauce which makes me happy. I feel like I'm in a proper pub which is always what I look for!</Text>

Irish Bank is a good solid bar in the Financial District.  Drinks here a priced moderately, with most people drinking beer or Irish Whiskies.  The outside patio is nice when its nice out, and there is a back room that has more tables as the main room gets too crowded.  Super fun on St. Patrick's day as they have a giant party here.  Also fun for Happy Hours.  It's a bit old and has that old bar smell.<//review>

It's a general downtown type bar - full of coworkers enjoying happy hour and suits that probably have to head home soon enough. The staff here is incredibly nice and accommodating. If you have a large party they'll save the back room or an outdoor table for you, which is super convenient for planning post meeting drinks.

Bar snacks here are decent, though I wouldn't go out of your way to eat at this classic bar.</text>

Big and laid back. We went here when we wanted to find a space for a lot of our friends to sit down and drink. We were able to sit outside and we were served really quickly by a friendly server. The food was adequate bar food and things were reasonably priced.</Review>

Great bar tucked away in a SF alley. The bartenders are friendly, fast and fun to watch. Let Mark shake you up something delicious, kick back and enjoy.
P.s. Shout out to the coolest cat behind the bar Trancito, his presence will put a smile on any face.<//review>

The Irish Bank is a great bar for outdoor gatherings.  Hidden away in an alley, the outdoor seating spreads out nicely with plenty of options to bring a big group.  The indoor portion is cozy in the front bar portion and more room is available in the back.  The staff (bouncers, servers, bartenders) is cool and friendly.</review>

I will not be going here any longer and I will convince my coworkers to visit other establishments from now on. The staff was "totally cool" but less than accommodating.

I arrived here with about 6 of my coworkers and more showed up throughout the night. The staff was unwilling to serve me at the bar due to the "table service" we didnt even want. We wanted to buy drinks at the bar and sit and chat at a table like every other bar in the city... No one was even ordering food... we sat in the outside patio and had a few drinks. I guess for them that meant one large tab instead of people ordering their own drinks individually.

When I went to close out my tab, to my surprise i was given a bill for half the table (one other person managed to open a tab separately and was charged for the other half of our group!). I asked if i could instead pay for just the drinks I ordered. No, I must pay the tab of the other members who were still there enjoying themselves.

... The waitress told me to go get cash from my table.

tl:dr; I was forced to pay for everyone instead of my own tab because I had to pay for the table service.</Review><gmap_id>0x8085808970c3e43b:0xe17d380c1e7aede8< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
A wonderful place if you want to get physically assaulted by staff.

Went here for dinner. Got a hamburger and two beers. Prices were a bit high, service a bit tame, but nothing terrible.

Came back later for late night drinks around 10 pm or so. Bought a $7 beer with a 10 dollar bill. Immediately after I purchased, went to put in a couple of bucks in the jukebox machine to hear some good tunes. When I came back, change from my beer was missing despite my being gone for less than a minute. Every bar I've been to, from SF to LA to Europe to Asia, has my change waiting for me after I order a drink.

Not the Irish Bank, apparently.

I called out the bartender on it. He told me I disappeared, despite me going to the jukebox literally right around the corner in plain eyesight. We get into a back and forth, he becoming faux defensive about me using the F-word. He gets my change from the tip jar for some reason instead of the cash register, further implying he never thought I was coming back and wanted to pocket the money. We get into a verbal altercation, I throw a beer in his face, and I get kicked out.

I know, immature move on my part. But i thought that was the end of it. I was wrong.

I sit outside a block up from the bar, smoking a cigarette about 15 minutes after the encounter. Bartender from earlier walks up and asks me if I'm the same guy, I say yeah. He starts throwing wild punches at me and kicks me repeatedly. I try to defend myself but he's vicious, throwing everything he's got at me. Bystanders witness the whole thing and cops get called, bartender runs off into the night. I spend 30 minutes filing a police report, officers constantly asking if I want to go to a hospital or emergency room to take care of my black eye and busted lip. I say no, I can take care of it on my own. They ask me if I intend on pressing charges, I say yes.

There's a lot of bars in San Francisco, and a lot in this nearby area. Don't waste your time on the Irish Bank. You'll either get overcharged for a beer or will get physically assaulted from staff. Unless your Muhammad Ali or Ronda Rousey, it isn't worth it to come here to deal with the fights. Attached is a photo of my black eye, courtesy of The Irish Bank.< /Review>

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the Irish memorabilia on the walls. A traditional pub and has pub type fare. Our chips and chicken strips were overcooked and dry but no doubt that helped us appreciate our beverages more. The tables were clean and it was decorated for Halloween when we were there but no apparent nods to Halloween in the food menu. Staff were friendly and of course you can get Irish whiskey and Guiness here.

Must be a great place to enjoy St Patricks Day and being so close to the financial district a good place work get togethers as it is bigger than it first appears.</text>

Nobody will greet you (in fact they stood and stared at me while I debated if I was able to just head to table). Also, when you are ready, go to the bar... I waited 10 minutes until I heard a buser tell a table they have to order at the bar.

After that, the service was fantastic, the gentleman that helped me was super friendly, knowledgeable, and quick.

I ordered the calamari and the Shepard’s pie. Save your money on the calamari; it’s chewy, overly fried, and completely lacking in flavor. I had to drown it in cocktail sauce just to get my money’s worth of the sustenance. The Shepard’s pie, on the other hand, is phenomenal. It comes out and looks sooo unassuming, but as soon as you let its molten innards cool you are treated with incredible flavor that you don’t want to stop.</text><rate>4</rate></record>

The beer is great and cheap. Best part of the night used to be when they added a new beer when one ran out to the old board. There are booths for larger groups, but theyre usually tough to grab. Groups also linger for a while (rightfully so), but plan to stand for a while before getting your paws on a seat</text>

<text>I love coming to the Irish Bank on warm evenings for happy hour.  Sit in the alley and kick back with a few friends for cocktails.  The place gets hoppin' after work so claim your seat early.   The food is okay but not great.  I typically just order an appetizer (cheddar fries!) to snack on while downing some tasty adult beverages.<//text>< response>

This is my first Google review. Sat down for a beer on the patio on a beautiful day. A patron sitting in the patio (a regular, based on how all of the wait staff treated him) lit up a cigarette, no more than 10 feet from the door, and smoked it brazenly, blowing smoke into the patio area as if he were smoking a cigar.

After a woman had to move closer to me, saying that she could not tolerate the smoke either (and also would not be able to eat nor bring her daughters to eat as she had planned), I went inside to ask a server to ask that they request the patron extinguish it. They made a cursory attempt to ask the regular to extinguish it, although he just held it under the table for the remainder of the cigarette.

As the woman could no longer handle the smoke still wafting into the patio area, she left abruptly. I moved to the only other open outdoor table -- seating for 10 or so. I sat at the very end. This was approximately 5pm on a beautiful Friday. While I was finishing my beer, a line formed for the patio, and I saw a number of groups leave in vain because there were no longer any "free" tables.

10 minutes later, when the man lit a second cigarette, I asked the waiter if they were going to enforce the smoking ban on the patio. The waiter said he "just got there" and did nothing. When I still smelled the smoke, this time from across the patio, I finally went inside, despite wanting to enjoy the fresh air of a beautiful day. I asked the manager (owner?) the policy for smoking on the patio. He said smoking it is "at your own risk", despite having signs prominently posted that say no smoking within 25 feet of any entrance (city law). I asked for clarification, and he said that if smokers get caught, that it's up to them to deal with the consequences. I asked if that meant the establishment makes any effort to operate consistent with city law, and he said (rather rudely) that "if we try to get them to put it out, then they just go into the alley and smoke anyway". When I pointed out that that would be perfectly legal and reasonable, so long they were removed from the entrance/patio area, he just walked away. I would not have taken the time to write this if it were not for the utter indifference and rudeness of this manager (owner)?

I would ask this restaurant, why do you condone your patrons breaking the law? Would you serve an inebriated person more alcohol "at their own risk"? What about the risk to the other patrons and employees who have to breathe carcinogenic smoke while they simply wish eat and drink?

IN SUMMARY, avoid this patio if you do not wish to have smoke blown in your face. Avoid the indoors of this establishment if the doors are open and you do not wish to smell smoke.</review>

<Text>Irish pub. Neighborhood bar for locals. Financial District bar. Out-of-towners come here too. It's a great low key pub in the heart of downtown San Francisco.< /Text>< rating>

As close to Ireland as one could get. I like getting the vegetable shepherds pie. The fish and chips are really good too. They have Guinness on tap which is my favorite accompaniment to my meal. Located in an alleyway, they have both indoor and outdoor seating.< /review>

We grabbed a table inside, the tables in the alley were full.  It's nice when you can order some decent food with the you beer.  I got the bangers and mash which was good.  It wasn't too crowded inside when we first got there, but the after work group started pouring in.< /review><user_id>111414489430298948350< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Great spot for a pint downtown. Although it's near the haute couture shopping district, the staff is friendly, the drinks are proper & the clientele are mostly unpretentious. Sláinte!</review>

One of the better irish bars in Sf, fun staff who understand when your new in town and haven't a clue. The selection of booze isn't amazing but it doesn't matter, as the atmosphere makes up for it. The fact it's down the alley makes the outside smoking area that much better.</Text>

Very cool bar in the heart of the FiDi.  We went there after an office party and sat outside.  The outside seating area is literally in the alley with a cover to protect from rain.  Very cool spot to meet some up with some friends.  The beer selection is pretty good, but the irish whiskey selection is awesome. I would definitely go back here<//Text>

The inside bar is fairly authentic recreation of a proper Irish pub but generic enough that it doesn't stand out - the outdoor seating area however, is beautiful and comfortable, the best in the area, and makes the Irish Bank worth a visit just to relax with a beer on the benches.<//Text>

Love this place.  Inside. Get The feel of an authentic Irish pub. Outside you can dine outside in th alley. Its a fun place.  Good Irish  pub food. Bangers and mash.  Irish stew. Ect. And of course don't forget the Guinness.  On tap.<//text>

A table sat next to us and we talked I informed them the service sucked. The waitress then came over and said you don't be rude to me. I said the only thing I said to you was Sheperds Pie. And she said well you as a customer you sucked!!!! I literally said my order to her only.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This place is MUCH different than described in the online reviews.  I hoped it would become my new Irish social spot. (If you were a patron of Joxer Dalys at West Portal and Durty Nellies on Irvine St., you will recall the friendly greeting received upon entering the bars and your favorite beer immediately brought to you by chatty, personable staff who always acted happy to see you.) What I found was a small, somewhat dark, antiquated, interior with a bar wrapped around a wall, some old tables and chairs in the middle of the floor, and a few large beer barrels in the corner surrounded by stools sitting against the wall.  I was not greeted by the bar staff when I entered, although there were very few patrons inside, so I sat down at a table and waited for a sever to take my order.  Suddenly, a woman rushed past me without a glance or acknowledgment; upon returning she caught my eye and quickly blurted out that I had to order at  the bar.  So, I  got up and stood in front of the bar, and without any formal greeting, one said,  "what do you want to order?"  The so-called authentic, delicious, Irish breakfast  came about 20 minutes later, tossed onto my table by the same barman, who then quickly rushed back to the bar.  As I looked down, I was shocked by the sight that greeted my eyes: Two overcooked, brownish eggs, with greasy egg whites; a burnt, tiny, shriveled piece of bacon; 2 tiny pieces of hard, overcooked white/black pudding (I couldn't tell you which was which); a small serving of (canned) baked beans and a piece of toast.  I ate it because I was starving and because my intuition told me to not waste my energy complaining about the complete lack of food quality and culinary skills in the kitchen.  I didn't want the experience to be a total loss so I decided to sit at the bar and order a beer.  One of the barman looked at me and said,  "Ready to Rock and Roll?" and then plopped my tab in front of my face. When I told him that I actually wanted to order a beer, he made a small effort to stop me but my facial expression said it all, and he left it alone, without so much as a "see you again," or "thank you for coming," as I left.  What a waste of $15.00.  Never again.  Google also recommended Chieftains Irish Bar, located on Fifth Street, for great Irish breakfast, lunch, and drinks.  I'll try them tomorrow.  Maybe they'll serve me a beer.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I am Irish and when I tried to go in I was refused entry because I didn't have a "valid ID". I showed my Age Card (which is issued by the police in Ireland), and when that was declined I also showed a Public Health card (issued by state) and a student ID (issued by national university) and still I was told no, even though all of them clearly stated my age (24, by the way). I was told I needed either a driver's license (which I don't have) or a passport (which I of course wasn't carrying around San Francisco with me in case I lost it). Also, I was arriving from work at 7pm in the evening - this wasn't a 1am occurrence or anything. Felt very unwelcome and would never want to go there again in the future.< /review>

I've only been here once, at Chinese New Year, so my review may not be representative of the rest of the year.

I thought there was a good selection of drinks and food. Seating wasn't too difficult to find, but service was overly complicated. The member of staff who started serving us said she was leaving, but she stayed there for a long time after she stopped serving us properly.

I'll go back and give it another chance because it seemed good over all.</text>

I guess this Irish pub wants a library like atmosphere since she honestly wasn't being that much louder than the other patrons.   We had intended to end a birthday pub crawl there but instead were forced to find someplace else.  The fact that she was Irish was ironic.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Cool little Irish pub. Neat back alley seating outdoors in the Financial district of San Francisco.< /Review>

Yeah they have it... but it's just standard pub stuff with an Irish twist, meaning you'll see some menu items that you expect since it's an Irish pub/restaurant. Great place to hangout with friends, and even unwind after work.<//review>< Pictures>

Went here on St. Patty day- it was epic. Prices are decent for SF- by no means cheap. If you love anything Irish, go here.</text>

<Response>None</Response><Text>I went here with a good friend St. Patrick's Day...PACKED, to the point the ladies were using the men's room.  Surprisingly kept clean in the bathroom, too.  The place is located in this sort of L-shaped alleyway steps from Chinatown.  I will say this, this makes it the ultimate setup for livebands and concerts outside, which they had.  The waitresses even trotted around the crown outside with trays of Guinness...the bar is really tight, though.  The usual Guinness and Smithwick is there as well as a variety of cocktails.  They handled the crowd better than expected, which was probably about 500 people.  I am curious to see if there are as many leprechauns around the rest of the year...< /Text>< date>

Ah, casual little Irish Pub tucked away in an alleyway - chose this place because it had open seating outside in the alleyway thought it'd be good for group of friends to chill - - but they didn't have them out that night I forget why, because forecast looked like rain?<//review>

No food after 11pm?  We were really hungry and looking for a place to eat and drink.  The Irish Bank told us at the door that the kitchen was closed....  but I thought I saw someone sitting at the table with a plate of wings....  I wish I could give this place a negative (-5) stars.< /Text>

Bouncer was a riot. Waved us down, helped us get settled, and bantered with us. Dining outside in the alley was cool. Standard pub fare.<//text>

“A tried-and-true spot to quaff a few pints of Guinness after work”, this “comfy” Irish Downtowner is the “rare place to take your drink outside in SF”, thanks to tables lined up in a hidden alley; “getting a seat” can be “tough”, but devotees are willing to wait to enjoy “great pub grub” and a “huge selection of whiskeys” delivered by “friendly” servers.< /review>

<Review>I went here for dinner with a friend.

It has a cool location in an alleyway. The food is mediocre bar food. The fries weren't very flavorful, the burger was standard fare.

People smoke in the outdoor alleyway which sucks.< /Review><time>1373065018934</time><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>3< /rate>< user_id>

The native favorites are all in abundance - from Shepherd's Pie and fish n' chips to Magner's, Smithwick's and Guiness tap. Table service is slow to a miss, but it is a fantastic pub with better-than-average food. Great for happy hour, groups, or just brooding over a beer at the bar. P.S. Keep an eye out for the confessional.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Irish restaurants seem to be highly criticized everywhere i go, making me think they are either sub-par on the west coast as a whole and i havent been exposed to anything else... or people are just stupid and snobby for no reason. as far as i can tell, this food is simple, filling, cheap, pub-style food to absorb all the alcohol you are consuming. and for me, that is just fine.

we were strolling around the area deciding on dinner, and the lovely alleyway patio caught my eye. the tables are simple no frills patio tables and the lighting is red at night...making food photography terrible btw :/

i will keep this simple like the food and experience was:

app: blue cheese fries. yum. IF you like blue cheese which is plentiful

irish beef stew: for a warm night it normally wouldnt have been my choice, but i wanted something authentic and several people spoke highly of it so i gave it a go. i liked it a lot...even with a small appetite. i would have liked it a bit chunkier with the veggies but the flavor was good.

black n tan: i just have to get it anytime im at an irish pub. well made :)

dining partner got the reuben and it looked quite tasty.

service was good...food came out quick...busser was VERY enthusiastic and diligent, it was sweet. no complains< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Serves food from morning to dinner after that like I said get ready to drink with the Irish great music entertainment live music for bull prices great happy hour prices and specials so if you want to sneak around and go to a pub that's not really a pub but just a hole in the wall this is the place to go great outdoor seating breakfast to dinner after drinking great place to hang out with friends. I go here every year for St Patrick's Day.</text>< userid>

<review>The best things about the Bank, that was actually once the Bank of Ireland: the whiskey list is great, the beers on tap, the filling pub food a cut above the usual, the cozy interior and alley seating, gets crowded, but if you want privacy they have an old confessional booth--not hokey as it might sound.< /review>< Gmap_id>

An unclear memory!
I came here with my brothers a few years earlier. We were a bit intoxicated and we really appreciated this little Irish pub for its terrace in the alley. But today it's a little cold to be outside. The interior is rather shabby, the atmosphere is not what we thought. The service is still very good and proper food. Choose this pub for the terrace.

Un souvenir pas clair!
J'étais venu ici avec mes frères quelques années plus tôt. Nous étions un peu en état d'ébriété et nous avions grandement apprécié ce petit pub irlandais pour sa terrasse dans la ruelle. Mais aujourd'hui, il fait un peu froid pour être à l'extérieur. L'intérieur est plutôt miteux, l'ambiance n'est pas ce qu'on pensait. Le service est quand même très bon et la nourriture correcte. Choisir ce pub pour la terrasse.</Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The beer selection is an Irish Pub accordingly. The food is not special, but you can eat it very well.

The location is very nice. Between two houses you can sit outside and there is a typical Irish pub atmosphere. Very comfortable, if you like it a bit louder.

The service is great 👌

(Original)
Die Bierauswahl ist einem Irish Pub entsprechend. Das Essen ist nicht besonderes, aber man kann es sehr gut essen.

Die Location ist sehr schön. Zwischen zwei Häusern kann man draußen sitzen und es herrscht eine typische Irish Pub Stimmung. Sehr gemütlich, wenn man es auch mal etwas lauter mag.

Die Bedienung ist super 👌< /review>

(Translated by Google) The bar is pretty nice, the beers offered excellent, but the atmosphere is really nothing when you go past midnight.

Le bar est plutôt sympathique, les bières proposées excellentes mais l'ambiance est vraiment au néant dès qu'on dépasse minuit.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Magic little Irish corner in this Chinatown of San Francisco. Cheap and typically Irish pub as we find in Galway. The waiters were very friendly and we had a lot of fun. We were two couples with a 9 year old who had a good laugh with the waiters. The atmosphere is warm. The food is also typical: fish and ship, Irish stew, among others.

(Original)
Magique petit coin irlandais dans ce quartier chinois de San Francisco. Pub pas cher et typiquement irlandais comme on en retrouve à Galway. Les serveurs étaient fort sympathiques et on a eu bien du plaisir. Nous étions deux couples avec un enfant de 9 ans qui a bien rigolé avec les serveurs. L'ambiance est chaleureux. La bouffe est typique aussi: fish and ship, ragoût irlandais, entre autres.</Text>
