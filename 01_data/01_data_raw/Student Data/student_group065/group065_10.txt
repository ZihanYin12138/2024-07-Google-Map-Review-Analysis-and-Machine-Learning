<Review>What can I say other than this place has always been a childhood favorite! Great memories of coming to this place for Lalapoloozas and happens to be my husband’s first job as a kid. I’m excited to see the new vegan options and coconut base for creamy velvety finish. I ordered the double scoop sugar cone but texture did not sit well on cone, which I do not mind, and put in a cup with an extra serving and cone on top. My husband loves their chocolate shake with choco chips!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnE1dCjZtKZaA949PLp_tBHZRBqWxyLjzBzSQ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTQRI3RUdiWUZPL2EbuIhozXTLH7xHeBtHeIbq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObQ1l18wZmPng9MIc5fq8IUazP5Ym8fcBBPRAG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqe8pX1HvE0dkiaoo5dHcbNp4yBTangrFjGYYI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFUbTHoBJF723PsXgYytCnDJH0MFywA0KVWdYt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU1Hy96cKZFz0dO7RlHM0VgI5hXha5kOQsf90N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<Time>1616301214269<//Time><Text>We've seen the ice cream parlor and wanted to give it a try. The ice cream itself was good, but our experience could have been better. Myself and my daughter each ordered a scoop of ice cream and after we paid, we were told to wait outside. No problem, there was a couple other customers and of course due to covid. We go to wait outside and a family of 3 come in and get served their 3 ice creams and we are still waiting. I noticed one employee cooking food and the other restocking items. I had to go back in and ask about my ice cream after waiting 10 mins for 2 scoops.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1620057442258, 'text': 'So sorry, sounds like your order got overlooked somehow.

Found this small place by off chance.

They make their own ice cream and even have a vegan option as well.

The grill area is small and all the food is made to order. Their menu is small and it covers just about everything you may want to eat, as long as it comes on bread, wrapped, or a salad.

Today they were out of (3) ice cream flavors, which seems odd. If they make their own on site, why not do so on a daily basis, or if one sells out?

The service was as good as to be expected.

We only have one scoop each; Strawberry (tasted like strawberry quick) and Swiss Chip Orange (tasted like a chocolate orange; you know the one that is sold around the holiday?)< /Review>

I don't think we have had a horrible time, the last time we were here we had Patrick as the server and he was wonderfully hilarious. He was highly tolerant of my 5 year old's tired, extra attitude. We had a great lunch with super dessert after. It is a bit on the pricey side but I tend to say it is worth it. We leave happy and full.
They should offer wheelchair rides to the car after.
Oh, did I mention they have a rewards program now? Earn points/stars with your visits. I am so happy they're back!< /Text>

Excellent ice cream. They have the best cookies and cream ice cream in the world!!! Also their almond topping is delicious. It is addictive. A few days ago I had their pastrami sandwich with a bowl of salad and it was delicious. They can get pretty busy, so be patient as their servers try their best to get everyone situated and taken care of. This is definitely the best ice cream place in Modesto. Please don't ever change anything!</Text>

Tons of flavor choices, that taste amazing!
Most choices are not made overly sweet,
but just right.
It is a hidden humble place, well known by locals
over decades.  They almost went out of business
a few years back due to an ownership change.
The locals basically "screamed for ice-cream" and
the new owners probably realized that they
had a sure thing going on.
Inside it is not fancy, but is very comfortable, with
comfy old style booths.
Besides or before you get the "required" Sundae
or BS, they do have a nice selection of dinner type
eats.  They are all quite good & made fresh.
Their service comes with lots of smiles & they are
more than happy to have you try lots of samples
as you decide what scoops to place on your BS.
Their BS is no BS!
This old school Ice-cream shop is one of few
gems in otherwise boring Modesto.  Thanks!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Used to be better back then... Tonight we had a big party for my aunts bday. We used to go all the time. Tonight... They were out of coffee??? Out of other random things.. Not all the ice cream flavors. Only got served drinks one time never came back for refills. But sandwiches and ice cream delicious still. Just need to get their inventory and customer service better.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809054251633415d:0x20685d1651a5f2b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The Ice Cream Company is the best place for ice cream in Modesto, it's pretty cheap and yummy too. It has a great kid friendly atmosphere and it's a good place for family dining. Their menu has several different tasty food options as well. I like to get the French dip, it's served with au jus and is mouth watering-ly delicious.< /Text>

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this place. French press coffee! OMG, I loved it. I only had soup and salad and coffee, but I will be back and I will try their yummy looking ice cream. This place and the people working there are A +.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Last Sunday evening around 8 PM four friends and I went to the Ice Cream Co. I had been craving a banana split all week and my wife is fond of home made ice cream.  When we tried to order we learned that the shop was out of vanilla and chocolate ice cream. In fact, they only had six to eight flavors available. Strawberry was the only flavor remotely appealing. After looking at what was available, everyone in our group decided that there was nothing that we wanted. We decided to go elsewhere. The clerk was very apologetic, but couldn't do anything about the problem. Later on , the group could not believe how an ice cream shop could NOT have vanilla or chocolate.

Yet customers who came in for ice cream were served right away.  The restaurant should stop serving regular food and should just serve ice cream unless they changr their serving priorities.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>We had a party of 5. We had to move tables to sit down. We sat there 10 min before we received our menus. Then another 10 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink. The coffee was cold. We then finally got our order in 10 minutes after that. As we sat the very large booth was getting their orders a little at a time. We got one of our orders 15 minutes after sitting. Then waited another 15 minutes for a milkshake (that sat on the counter for 8 minutes). Now I forgot to mention, when we did order they were out of coffee ice cream. So that person ordered peanut butter and coconut. The girl came over to tell us that the coconut ice cream was out nearly 20 minutes after we ordered, there was coconut when we ordered. So our guest cancelled his ice cream all together. My husband said, "Just cancel the other orders we will pay for the items we received" and we left. There was 6 people working that we could see. There was apparently someone eating there that was an employee, because they got their stuff not sure if soup or milkshakes and went out the back door. Now when we received the milkshake the people at the booth next to us party of 4 got two of their orders. How is that when we had ours in way before theirs. This seems to be common at this ice cream parlor. We are very loyal and come here often. At this point we will not be back for a very long  time or never.These people all looked new, never seemed in a rush to help or check on any of the guests in the parlor. Not sure why you are still in business. I really don't understand how you can ever run out of ice cream. The walk in guests get helped before we even got our full order is that why there was no coconut when they finally got to us???? That is not good business and not good customer service.</text><GmapID>0x809054251633415d:0x20685d1651a5f2b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We walk in all excited for ice cream and wait a few minutes. Then they ask for drinks and we all order water. Water. Then 10-15 minutes later we order our ice cream with still no water. Then about 29 minutes later another group with more people come in and they order water too and the guy immediately went to go get them and and we still wait for our water and ice cream. Ice cream was good but service was terrible!!</Review>

For the first time in years I have to say it was an awful experience I asked for the same Sunday I asked every time it's always been made right for some reason the gentleman that was making it named Corey decided to be funny while making it and didn't realize he wasn't following the what was written down when they took the Sunday back he felt he could say f****** people not knowing we were looking straight at him< /text>

<text>This is Kimball recreation center and park. There's a walking, jogging, running trial that runs the perimeter of the park...bikes can use it too. There's lots of open grass fields for playing and running your dog, and soccer fields. There's a beautiful aquatic center with a fun Children's area, two giant water slides, an Olympic sized pool, and a lap pool. I think every Thursday there's a farmer's market that sets up in the parking lot. There's also a couple electric car charging hookups.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have never swimmed here, I know many people who have visitied this pool park and love it. I know that it is beautiful and clean and has showers and club programs for kids and exercise swim sessions for adults. A great place to get away on a warm sunny ventura day. Swimming is my favorite activity of choice. When I was 15 years younger, I swimmed a mile everyday at the Pierpont Racquet club. I swam 77 miles in the 100 day challenge back in 2007.<//review>

This is a  very  nice  park.  Needs more restroom.  Only  2 outside  and  I believe  4 inside  the  pool  area.   They had big  plans  to expand  the  facilities  in 2016 and  2017  but  I guess  that  has  been  put  on hold.< /Text>

This is a great park to walk. I dont play soccer or baseball/softball but there are facilities for that here as well.</Review>

The sculpture itself is rather bland.  The aquatic center it is located within is great.</Text>

On top of not entering info in portal when order was placed into it. I stood there for 15min or more before being assisted.  That's why I used the portal to avoid such wait. And,  all that time my order was sitting right in there. Smfh!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Best Little Ceasars Pizza I've been to. Their pizza is always hot and fresh. Employees are always friendly. I've been to two different Little Ceasars Pizza places near by and at one of the places the pizza was horrible and the other the pizza was ok.<//text>

Most of my experiences at Little Caesars are just fine although this one was rather unpleasant. Sacramento county recently passed another ordinance requiring masks in public but not a single employee had one on. Quite concerning giving they handle food. That and it took almost 10 minutes for a single order of crazy bread. Won't be coming to this one again.< /text>

Just left after getting a refund. I was there over a half-hour. Worker told me twice it was coming out of the oven it never did. When I was getting the refund they had the wrong order. Very disappointing.</text>

The service was fast, they were very kind, even got my name right. Which most people don't do surprisingly. But, they didn't try to force me to buy something I didn't want. Overall good place to get some quick pizza. The wings aren't award winning, still good though. The crazy bread is fantastic. Would recommend.</Text>

We asked for no butter no parm &  light sauce and got everything we didn't want. They had to remake it, and gave us 1 order of free crazy bread... I wanted to say I don't want to wait another 45 minutes for a pizza (they can keep it) they said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I just wanted to get my money back.</Review>

<Text>Excellent pizza for the prices. Counter service missed the mark. Only one cashier on a Friday evening around 6:30 p.m. The wait time, line made me think twice about returning. The cashier handled the line with a smile which made the wait a little more pleasant, howwver this situation was not fair to her when there were numerous people in the back doing who knows what. This Mack Road location could use some TLC....<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Wouldn't recommend this location. Over priced cheese pizza. Not hot and ready at the time of order. It took them 15 minutes to make 1 cheese pizza. Even with 5 people working the back. Wouldn't recommend this location.< /review><userid>102628404740307355787</userid>< rate>

I've never liked L.C. pizza but I needed a affordable pizza for a small work party. I ordered 2 large pepperoni pizza's with x-sauce. The pizza had lots of cheese and sauce, they were DELICIOUS. Also the cashier a young lady
was very friendly and helpful.< /Review>

maybe because it was busy and they were out of the bread that they possible rushed out my order and that's why i got raw bread.  Service was nice the lady in the fromt was polite. Will try this little ceasars out again. I got the all meat pizza and added the hot wings combo to it. My son LOVES there wings so he had no complaints.</Text>< pics>

I went in to pick up a Hot and Ready for a friend. I was charged at the cash register for the pizza but when she pulled it out of the oven she said this one's not ready. I was confused since I had never ordered this before, but it turns out they expire in the oven and then they won't sell them to you. So I had to wait 18 minutes to get something called a Hot and Ready when the were 4 sitting there. It may have been hot but it definitely was not ready. So frustrating.<//Text>

1. I placed an order over the phone and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes.

2. After 25 minutes,I get to the shop to pick up the pizzas,(3). They were not ready. Older lady at the regiater said that the order will be ready soon. So i waited , and waited....

3. After an hour of waiting, they finally got my order ready. I ordered 3 pizzas and they messed up one of the pizzas. I couldn’t wait any longer for another so i took it

4. I will never be coming back to this Little Ceasars again. Poor mangement. Horrible customer service. Im suprised that they still are in business.< /Text>

Service was extremely slow and the cashier was rude. That’s fine I can deal with that. However, there were maggots in the pepperoni pizza!!!! Stay away from this place at all cost unless you enjoy eating maggots!!! Additionally, while I was waiting there for 25 minutes for a pepperoni cheese bread a 4 year old boy came in with his dad and was stealing the quarters from the pinball machine. Will never be going to this little Ceasers again!!! I have been going to the little ceasers on Elk Grove Blvd for years and never had an issue before. I called the little ceasers to inform them of the maggots I found in the pizza and they hung up on me, so unprofessional!!!< /Review><Name>Mhayra De Guzman</Name><time>1559775910616<//time>< rate>

Aside from the place being right in the heart of the MACK road. If you know what I mean. Always surrounded by suspicious characters. The team that prepares the pizza are always goofing off in the back while getting things done efficiently. They are prime example of how to work and have fun at the same time. Just saying tho. I like this place. The only little caesars pizza I go to. The team is respectable, and they always greet with a smile.</review>

I keep trying to give Little Caesars a chance but everytime I go periodically over the years it's still the same no flavor in the sauce and that pizza is like cardboard well maybe it's that location<//Review>

Ashore was sweet. I think the cheese pizza should be $6 or a hot n ready option. Not as cheap as it used to be but it was okay.</Text>

Rude cashier, when I asked for a small container of mushroom for a dollar.  She said,  I'll give it to you for 2 dollars.
Also, when can you go to any store and they have Cheese Bread ready to just take and go? Not here, not even the pizzas are ready to go.
Would not recommend this place if your expecting to get right in and go.< /review>

I've been there twice in 3 weeks. Each time I was told i would have to wait 10 min for a cheese pizza. Each time I waited more than 25 minutes. Meanwhile other customers come in and order the same thing I am but they are in and out. Tonight after waiting 25 minutes my son asks how much longer. The cashier says a minute or two. Another customer walks in orders a cheese pizza. He's told they have one almost ready. The manager then asks how long we've been waiting. I tell her over 25 minutes. She says its going to be 5 more minutes. I say forget it just give me a refund. Why such horrible service 2 times in a row. Racists...thats right. Every customer that came in in after me was black...I'm white..same scenario both visits. I can clearly see and feel the resentment and disrespect..
I guess I shouldnt have oppressed blacks by giving them jobs and a brighter future. Be careful who you disrespect, you may be sitting across from them in a job interview some day. What a bunch of losers!!

Went in for a hot and ready but the dude said it would take a while because he didn't have any made. Wtf? Thought it was hotand ready? And there were no bread sticks made. Then to top it off this dude offers the lady plates cheese and every other thing he can offer giving her way too much while I left with no napkins plates cheese chilly from being distracted by the wait. Ill never spent money here again!</review>

Cheese crust pizza was horrible. Sorry, it just was. I bought 2. After we ate the 1st, I threw the 2nd one away.  It barely tasted like cheese.  Very sour.< /review>

Find another little Caesar's to buy at terrible service unless you enjoy waiting more than 10 minutes after my order was made just sat there the woman behind the counter looked at it who it was for walked in back started bullshitting with other workers finally came back took a order from another customer then went back to the rack read again and finally called out my name.i will not be visiting this Little Caesar's again.< /text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Not the best fast food chain imo but if your gonna go to a subway you cant go wrong with this one. Open 24 hours and the staff is always friendly. But i do have to mention if you vegan,halal, or kosher they are known to touch the meat and even the pork and touch your ingredients. Glove swapping should be a common practice but hear you have to to tell them or they will get all up in there with they meat.<//review>< Date>

Of all the Subway restaurant I have been too...this is by far the most satisfying. From the food quality...to the customer service. Excellent! Small location. Some seating available. Not much. Surrounded by large shopping center. Great for quick bite while running errands.<//text>

Always open and always kept clean. It's a small location so to go orders are recommended over eating there. Don't forget to download and use the subway app even if you pay cash in store. Get those savings!<//Review>

<review>Worst experience I’ve ever had at a subway! I went in there to buy some cookies & I was racially discriminated against multiple times. The only reason I was even helped was because the Caucasian gentleman behind me in line spoke up & told them that I was ahead of him & it’s not right that they are trying to skip me for no reason. There were 3 employees behind the counter & only 1 other customer, but they refused to help me. I used to eat at the subway by my job 4-5 times a week. Never again will I give any subway my money. I’ve never had such a terrible experience as a customer in my life.<//review>< Pictures>

Website says open 24 hours until you realize pumps are supposed to be open 24 hours but as you can see they're not and 70 cents per gallon disappeared because of this and I'm poed. Although one call to Safeway Customer Service and all is well again $0.70 per gallon back on my card thanks Safeway you rule but please update your website so that people know the fuel pumps are not open 24 hours thank you<//Text>

Gas is cheap, long lines but worth the wait. If you have points you can pay up to a dollar less for Gas! Love Safeway and their gas station!<//text>

<Review>Make sure you rack up your points before you go get gas because I saved a dollar per gallon which is amazing here in California when gas is almost $4 a gallon the only thing is is you got to wait and a very long line but it's worth it a dollar savings on a gallon of gas< /Review><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><username>Elizabeth Flores</username>< UserId.>

Has always been a good experience but this last time, a CPL weeks ago, I went to fill up and would swear I was pumping AIR FOR THE LAST APPX 10 Or 15 $$. Said they coudnt put exact amt on my card for some reason and talked me into putting more than I knew I'd need on my card. Said it just wouldn't charge me if to much. I heard the gas machine click, like it shut off but the meter still rolled till the full amt was exhausted. Think I was robbed. The guy inside made mention of how they had recently been ripped off by customers somehow. I think they're trying to make back their loss. I've seen this before, yrs ago at another station so recognized the behavior of the gas machine. Buyer Beware!! Only purchase what you need and pay cash if you can!!!<//Text>

Best if you shop at the adjacent Safeway store where you can get  dime-a-gallon off points.   Recently went to free compressed air.   Caution  due to heavy traffic in the area you need to be South-bound on Lomitas Avenue on the East side of the station to enter.<//text>

The hours are posted as 6am to 12am everyday however I was just there on Sunday night at 10:35 and it closed right as I pulled in. I've tried going in other days at 11pm and they were closed. I'd rate higher if they posted the correct times they were open<//Text>

<Review>Perfect for temporary. I like that u pay half up front. Affordable. I give a three star because there are better insurances out there than fiesta. They don't offer rental service on their plan full coverage etc.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I was helped by Patricia. All questions I had were answered and she really is knowledgeable in what she does. I also didn’t last long there which made the visit even better, not overwhelming at all. Very fast and effective and I really recommend insuring with Fiesta Insurance!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Patricia was very professional and very helpful, she helped me save a whole lot of money. She is the best insurance agent I have ever encountered, everyone should ask for her when they go into fiesta. 10/10<//Review><GmapID>0x80ea6c1313a890d5:0xee0be307fb1eeb94</GmapID><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

<review>Definitely referring my friends and family to Patricia, not only is she helping me save money but Fiesta Insurance now has a customer lifetime value. Don’t see myself switching insurance companies and it’s all thanks to her, made this decision simple as we went over all the options Fiesta had to offer.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Lauren provided excellent customer service.  She helped my son find 2 pairs of shoes that had a wider width.  We found out from her, that Vans Pro give a bit wider fit.< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
I went to this store per my boyfriend's request because he wanted to take advantage of their dress shirt sale. He found a better discount in the back and bought two dress shirts. I was actually surprised with finding a small section for women and got a great deal on a white blouse with floral detailing on the front for $9. The cashiers at Van Heusen were friendly as well. Knocked off one star because the store was a mess.<//Review>

Love Van Heusen! I get all my office clothing from there as they have beautiful patterns and fit well at a great price.

When can Van Heusen provide online shopping??</review>

<Review>Okie I never had a problem with vans till today. So my classmates bday is next month, and since me and my other classmates are like the best classmates ever, we decided to get her a thoughtful gift, the black and white checkered vans. However, since we are just some broke seventh graders, it is quite difficult for us to afford, considering it is $50 ($55 with tax). Therefore, we just wanted a single shoe, (only the left or right). In this situation, we only wanted the right shoe. This is because our classmate somehow lost her right shoe at school (she has the checkered vans in black and grey). So, we decided if she were to lose her right shoe again she’d have a backup. We also came to the conclusion that the black and white vans are extremely basic. This is a crucial part in why we wanted it, since our classmate thinks she’s not basic, even though she only wears gap and her vans. She enjoys calling other people basic as well. For her birthday, we wanted the guy she likes to ask her out by proposing to her with one shoe. We decided that if we weren’t allowed to do this that we will get two single shoes in seperate sizes, (one in six for our classmate, and one in nine for her soon to be boyfriend, as like a “congrats y’all are dating” gift). So, we went up to the cashier and asked her if we were purchase the shoes as so. She replied in an extremely rude voice, and looked at us as if we were some mentally ill kids, as well as asking us why we would need that, (which isn’t right since that isn’t her place to ask). She looked like she really wasn’t in the mood to be there. So in the end, we payed for a pair of black and white checkered vans size six. We might have to sell our houses after this since this gift was so expensive. I am extremely dissapointed in the quality of vans customer service.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fceb5eb5cebf7:0xc06bc03c61a693ad<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Large warehouse with many of its products.
It looks good supply of sports shoes, of course skaters trend.
The prices still do not convince me much and I hope they improve them, because it is an oulet.

(Original)
Gran almacén con muchos de sus productos.
Se ve buena oferta de calzado deportivo, por supuesto de tendencia de los patinadores.
Los precios aún no me convencen mucho y espero que los mejoren, pues se trata de un oulet.<//Review>

<Text>Excellent meal, great service and nice atmosphere.  Not your typical Sports Bar, has some nice upscale features. Good selection of beers both on tap and bottles.
There is a beef appetizer that I highly recommend trying, definitely my personal favorite.
You can tell the care that has gone into choosing the ingredients and the preparation of all of the items on the menu we had.
Also a great option for larger groups.</Text><name>Douglas Williamson< /name>< user_id>

< Review>
The best Vietnamese restaurant in the San Jose location. For the look of the restaurant was cleanness and very nice cool atmosphere.  The staff are very friendliness with a great smile. Authentic Vietnamese cuisine was fresh, the soup broth was very flavor and hot. I have a great time enjoying tasting the foods, also excellent Vietnamese coffee, super strong, will get you through your day! Highly recommended. Will definitely be going back and try different foods on the menu.</Review>

I visit San Jose four or so times a year. This is the closest place to work and hotels that I like.   Food is quite good (be forewarned its pretty salty). Beer selection is interesting.  Docking a star as could be cleaner, especially entrance and bathrooms.</Text>

<Review>I know this establishment is labeled as Vietnamese...as it should be..but don't let that sway you.. this bar is very open and friendly to all. Stoped by to watch some sports and have a drink...first let my say don't go before 5pm if you want a mixed drink.. having said that after 5 the bartender was was friendly, accommodating and the drinks were good. Had the salt and pepper prawns.. DELICIOUS!!!! Once again I can't say enough about the bartender..ordered a well known drink he made (good) then made another and put his twist on it (better) this was my first time there but not my last. With it's location, easy to by pass or just over look as not worthy. Don't let that fool you. If you're in the area and like Asian food and good drinks it's a must< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Other days happy hour is 4 - 7pm. Lots of TV so it's like sports bar. Music is good. I recommend.</Review>< resp>

We ordered 3 dishes: Crispy chowmain, fried rice, and 1 large Pho- the portions were huge! There were 2 adults, and 2 children and we all were so full and took the leftovers. The food was so delicious and flavorful!! My family was very impressed. The restrooms were clean and the ambience is the place was good. Modern decor and comfortable seating options. The food did take a long time to be served and it wasn't busy. I thought it possibly being due to being made fresh.</review>

<Date>1486092038106< /Date><rate>5< /rate><review>I've been here twice so far.. Once for a quick dinner with friends. The second time was for a big group event for my friends' birthdays.

The first visit we just shared a bunch of plates. Nothing really stuck out to me. I only liked the crispy noodles dish. The second time I came here we had a set buffet menu my friends picked out. I loved the crab egg drop soup, and mussels! They had a buffet table set up on the side of our seating area. They were able to accommodate nearly 40 people in our party throughout the night. Very impressed! We sat in the lounge area near the entrance. Loved the decor: lighting, seats, tables. Everything!

Chill vibes, and plenty of TVs to watch sports games. Service is great here. The servers make sure you are taken well care of, and bring everything you need out quickly. Food is kinda pricey here though since it's a sports bar.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been working in this area for 3 years. I would've never stepped into this place had it not been recommended by a Vietnamese co-worker. It just didn't look like what I expected at all from the outside. All these years i'd assumed it was a classic sports bar. But that was far from reality. Inside yes, there's a bar, but the menu is clearly Viet - without question. A quick overview of the clientele confirms this. And its pretty good too. I recommend the bun bo Hue, and would come back. My only knock on this place is that it is not obvious from the outside. I would never have even considered it and would've gone on thinking it was an American sports bar forever had I not been informed otherwise.

So here I am to inform you, good reader, that it is a Viet restaurant, not a sports bar.</review>

Went there after work to watch the game.. Ambiance is good for a sports bar, slightly upscale. Good beer option with decent staff. The food sucked, albeit I tried one item which is a typical sports bar item and only a person with single digit IQ can mess up. It was double fried, no flavor at all, probably stale... Got a bad tummy ache right after #FAIL.. Go there for drinks while watching the game. Stay away from the food menu... That's what I'm doing< /Review>

During the day it's a restaurant and during the evening, it's a lounge/bar. The menu for lunch is pretty limited, but the food is pretty decent<//review>

We were @ an event late & got to the restaurant about 10:30. On Google it says that they close at midnight, but they close their kitchen at 10:30 & from 10:30 to midnight is more of a club than a restaurant loud music and cocktails but no food<//Review>

<review>I like the modern decor and lighting, but made the mistake of ordering food. The salt & pepper prawns were barely edible. There was a huge amount of salt, probably half a cup of dried red chilli pepper flakes and about 10 deep-fried jumbo prawns. The prawns might have been styrofoam packing peanuts. I wouldn't have been able to taste the difference. There were also slivers of bell pepper and onion, rendered inedible by salt and chili flakes. I can handle spicy food, but felt pretty sick after eating this. Had I not been very hungry, I would have left after the first bite. Luckily I made it home just in time to pray at the porcelain altar. Despite the place being virtually empty on a Wednesday night, I was also charged for buffalo wings I had neither ordered nor received. The waitress apologized and corrected the mistake, though. Prawns, a bowl of rice and a glass of beer were $30.<//review>< Resp>

<text>A really interesting place.  Wholly Vietnamese owned and run but feels almost like a night club vs. a traditional Vietnamese eatery.  It is very modern in design and decor but the food is pretty legit. Even the crowd is a mix of young and trendy folk mixed with business lunch crowds and traditional patronage of the older generation.  The Bo Luc Lac (sp?) is just like mom's and very tasty and the Bun Bo Hue I had was flavorful (though on the lighter side relative to other establishments) and my companion really enjoyed his Pho.  In addition, the bar attendant knew all the beers on tap but with a mid/heavy Vietnamese accent.  Not something I am used to hearing and really impressed.  I recommend this place for authentic Viet food in a non traditional modern environment and look forward to trying other dishes here in the future.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808fcc0ec732076d:0x70de2f9b4e845412</Gmap_id>< Rate>

Beers are decent price. Vibe was ok. Bartender was an ass. Hella attitude when asked for a drink menu and makes no conversation. Asks questions and then walks away as soon as you start answering and talk to the other bar tender. Won't be going back< /Text>

<Review>Food was decent just lots of confusion for this place. Is it a restaurant, bar, club? Also no pho on dinner menu and we would have random waiters doing the service.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcc0ec732076d:0x70de2f9b4e845412<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As we arrived to the restaurant, the entrance was a bit odd because you had to go right into the patio to get to the front door. The restaurant was pretty busy but we were able to get a seat relatively quick.
As we looked through the menu, we noticed the food was a bit pricey, but decided to stay because we came here for the fried calamari. We ended up ordering the fried calamari and seafood chow mein. The fried calamari came out first and it was pretty tasty. It came with a side of sweet chili sauce. The chow mein seemed to take much longer to make. In between, they brought out the wrong order which was some chicken wings. I let them know right away we didn't order any wings.
Overall, the fried calamari was pretty tasty, but the seafood chow mein was nothing special. Both dishes were $18 each so there wasn't much value. After tax and tip, it was $40 ish for an appetizer and noodles.
We don't plan to come back which is too bad because the fried calamari was good. Another down side was there wasn't much service after we got our food.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Rancho Wellness works very hard at making you feel safe being seen by the physician. Wait outside for your temperature, also to make sure waiting room is clear. Take your vitals in one place. Move to waiting area. Called very timely into treatment room. Goes Without saying best physicians around. Dr. Singh is very compassionate and follows up with me.
I feel very blessed to have such a wonderful physician.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c336a8ccce6a5d:0x4325cb7ccf822376<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I called in hopes to finally find a family doctor for my family and I to be told by the receptionist that I would have to first call my insurance to verify if they were in my network. First I will start by saying I’ve never been asked to do that before setting up an appointment. I’ve always been asked for my info and from my basic knowledge the insurance verification is done by the doctors office. The reality is an average person won’t know a lot on how to deal with all of this. They (doctors office) are the professionals and know a bit more that we (the patient) would. That lead me to think that it was pure laziness. So won’t be following up because if this is how a new patient is treated I can only wonder how it would be to go in to check up on my health.<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve been a patient here for almost 11 years! Customer service from the office staff is always friendly, efficient and helpful. Dr Singh is hands down, the kindest doctor you’ll ever meet. In addition, he’s extremely knowledgeable and thorough. He’s helped me thru some difficult issues. With 2 locations, it’s very easy to be seen in 1-2 days! Nurse Heidi is awesome and on top of it! Eric, I believe is relatively new, but has been amazing! Thank you Rancho Wellness!<//Review>

<Text>My husband and I have been going to Dr. Singh’s office for the past 20+ years we started with him when he was at the Milliken office prior to this location. Dr. Singh is friendly and very professional.
The staff are great especially Barbara Santa Cruz.
The reason for the four and not a five is the feeling of being rushed through the appointment  the last couple appointments, not sure if this is due to everything that’s going on around us right now with Covid or what but we appreciate all they do for us.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Good folks. Always given an appt within 24-48 hours of my call.  Everyone I’ve seen there has been good.  They’re personable, caring and they make time to listen to your concern.  Dr. Singh is amazing.  I’ve had him as my PCP for 8 years.  Heidi and Barbara, the PA’s are excellent, too.
Front desk staff is efficient. They follow up and get back to you with return calls and orders, etc.  Don’t mind writing a review.  Thus far, it’s been a good experience.< /Review>< Pics>

Edit: I've gone back to this place three times now since writing my review originally. They continue to be an A+ operation - very friendly, very helpful, not rushed. Can't say enough good! I'll be going here for the foreseeable future!<//review>< Pics>

Great staff, excellent customer service and care. However, due to the highly recommended reviews, you will not be able to see the doctor for two weeks.... you might be dead by then. But don't come here unless it is for a routine... it can wait, no rush, time is of no concern, I don't care about my health.... type of visit. The practice needs about 5 more doctors like Singh and then this would be a five star location. Staff is knowledgeable, straight to the point, no nonsense, try not to waste your time, type of people. Many people change their GP doctor to here, but you must understand, this doctor is great and the whole tri-county knows it, therefore no immediate visit is available. Kind of hard to live with a medical condition that arises suddenly and then wait two weeks to get the doctor to look at you. You could be dead by then.....< /review>

<Text>I had to switch from my old doctor to this practice. I really liked my old practice but they became a little bigger then they could handle. I had to make appointments months out and they wouldnt even be able to refill my inhaler prescription for months . I am so glad I switched to this practice. They are so friendly and work with me to get me seen sometimes that day. Its still new with them but so far so good. Heidi is very nice and never seems to rush me. The way they conduct business is very refreshing.  Thank you Rancho Wellness!</Text><username>Torry Scarbrough</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< rate>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Had my first appointment with a nurse practitioner Miss Heidi.
When I walked in I immediately noticed a very foul smell which is why they don't get 5 stars. The receptionist and medical assistants were friendly and professional. Wait time was less then 20 minutes. And my nurse practitioner listened to all of my concerns and made a plan personalized for me.
I did not feel rushed  or like my problems were imaginary .  That is truly appreciate it! I would definitely recommend Rancho Wellness in Upland.< /Review></record>

My husband has been seeing Heidi Larson for 2 years now and we follow her wherever she goes. She’s awesome! She sees my husband for his asthma. We’re very comfortable with her. She always listens and she really knows her stuff. Staff at both locations are always pleasant.<//review>

I've been a patient here and so has my teen daughter, for about 2 years.
I've seen Jessica Vanderkallen, Heidi Larson, Barbara Santa Cruz, and Dr. Singh.
I truly appreciate the functional medicine method they practice in solving the root cause of issues vs just writing a prescription without figuring out what the cause is.
All of the practitioners are very professional and take time to talk to you about all aspect of your health, even your diet!
The staff is very kind and one of the best office staff I've ever encountered.
Would highly recommend this office!<//Text>

Firstly we are great admirers of SAKOON chain of restaurants, especially Mountain View branch.
We visited to dine in around 9 Pm yesterday
And we were received by two ignorant waiters who seems to care-less about the customer service rather rush to their homes soon.
We ordered some beers and starter (SIZZLER) recommended by them and funny part is it didn’t come in sizzler plate but got charged the same and the waiter explanation is too silly to post it here!!   I will leave pics below for reference.
For main course we order a bread basket,curries n rice. Curries and rice were good but bread was dried up.
Pro
- good old monk beer
- tasty curries
Cons
- worst service
- bad starters for premium price
- wouldn’t recommend bread basket

SAKOON el Camino branch needs to maintain their standards. Would recommend this place to anyone. For proper SAKOON experience visit the one on the Castro street, Mountain View.< /text>

Food was good. We had one of our close friend’s farewell party. We all had (around 20people) great time. Courteous staff and nice ambience 👏☺️< /Text>

< Review>
I liked this location compared to the Mountainview. The interior is very nice. I would even say romantic. The service is usual, however the food is made upon the order, so expect a bit longer wait than usual. However, the food presentation is very good and the taste is delicious too. The quantity is sufficiently provided too. Good for multiple visits :)<//Review>

The lunch buffet is solid. The dessert was so so and there wasn’t any chai. The location is good and Sakoon was able to accommodate our large group while it was quite busy. It’s worth checking out but I do feel like the buffet may have been better before the remodel.< /text>

<Text>We recently visited this place. Beautiful ambience and amazing food.

The lady who took our order was always smiling and gave us some good suggestions. A must try is avocado jhalmuri in starters. Mango lassi was fantastic too. The non-veg and veg fare was equally delicious.< /Text>< Pics>

The lunch buffet is a great experience with so many selections to satisfy both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.  It provides a full course meal with various appetizers, salads, main courses, and desserts.

The restaurant provides a great ambience, and is conveniently located with lots of parking spaces.< /text>

Dine in has started. We visited this Friday and were 10-12 people. Food quality was good. In veg starters, try Avacado Zalmuri (Avacado bhel), its unique dish. In veg main course, personally I liked Paneer Peshawari. In non-veg starters chicken tandoori was good.</Text>

Their weekend buffet was beyond expectation. Maybe because they are new in the area. I liked how they have separate counters for veg and non-veg. I am vegetarian. Everything was super tasty, specially dahi vada and gajar halwa. They had 5 veg curries, dal and kadhi. Worth for $14.99. Staff members were very friendly. The only thing I didn't like is they charged $10.99 for kid's buffet which I feel was not fair given the adult price was $14.99. Also, they should have table covers.<//Review>

Ambiance- 2 out of 5 poor sitting, poor lightning.

Drinks: virjin mango mojito was just mixture of 2 table spoon of mango juice in plain water with some mint leives. (Glad Myra, she asked how was the drink when we shared she quickly got the another fixed one.)even at the end she did not charge for the drink.

Food:food was okay we missed the real Sakoon taste.

Serivce was on time, same as usually authentic Sakoon style.

May be next time it will be more improved.

All the best for the new branch.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1ntZa37aR1IsNXbHcaVtZW4O9MqOU6_o7oTLP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAHaO61tIbNtIpw9OIaEhaXxjvkOtQ9-o5j6wd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Health Scare Alert!
Ordered butter chicken from their El Camino unit on July 17th. Disgusting quality of chicken: large pieces that were hard and dark and were clearly from an unhealthy chicken.

This unit needs to be reported to the Health Department. If you cannot serve customers healthy food(not even tasty!) you do not deserve to be running.< /Text>

We requested him to give us a table instead of an elevated booth because my mom had recently gotten into an accident and the booth would be difficult for her to sit at. There was a table for 4 that had no one seated and had multiple dirty plates that indicated that this table was empty. He said we had to wait for 20-25 minutes for that table. However he gave that table to someone else after 5 minutes we requested for it. He kept arguing and was incredibly inconsiderate. He made our experience at this restaurant a horrible experience.

< Review>
The Lunch Buffet dessert has Rosmalai! New restaurant, so as expected -decor is shiny clean and food presentations sharp. Waiters were attentive, food is fresh. Review after two visits.
Lunch Buffet: good selection. "Shaag" was good. Kebab items make the mark. A little too much salt (cliche in many Indian Buffets).

Tried a dinner a la carte. Got a platter with Chicken, lamb and lamb rack + shrimp. Can be shared by two. Get an extra naan. The included naan is only two pieces, not two whole naan. I was unpressed by the rack of lamb and shrimp.</Review>

<text>Would give 0 stars if I could. My husband and I were there at 5.30pm (they open at 5pm) and the host was on the phone with someone making a reservation. He did not even acknowledge our presence or indicate that he would be with us soon. Nothing. He even looked at us but just continued on like we weren't there. Not the first time experiencing such horrible service here. A few months back we made a reservation for a party of 7 and we had to wait 40mins to be seated. There was a heavily pregnant woman in our group too. No apologies for the delay. Food was decent but definitely not worth the bad service by the wait staff. Skip this place and go to Mantra a short distance away instead.<//text>< pics>

The lunch buffet is great. I love the chili chicken. Dinner is a la carte. Sadly no chili chicken available but their is a spicy chicken tandoor style. In the evening the place was quiet. They have a full bar (though as a nit the old fashioned needs some work)</Review>

Ever since Sneha changed ownership and name to Marigold, the quality went down, and they cut out most of the dishes that I liked. Since then, I've been looking for a replacement Indian lunch buffet, and Sakoon is it for right now.

They can be very busy during the week at lunch. The first time I went, I left because the buffet line was wrapping back into the room at the back of the restaurant.

Their goat curry is very good. Lots of flavor, a little heat, and the goat is very tender.

None of the dishes I had disappointed me.

They also have a nice vegetarian selection. The lunch buffet is about $15.<//text>

<review>Food was decent. But we had to wait for more than 1 hr to get our food. Many around us were complaining about the delay. Even though I reminded the waiter (twice) about my drink, he still didn’t get my drink. Very badly managed when it comes to time keeping. Not worth your time.</review>< Pics>

Last week, we came here all the way from the East bay to try Sakoon in Santa Clara. We have a family member Who uses a motorized wheelchair and has a service dog. Sakoon staff / server wasn't welcoming and took us in the back and was offering us to be seated in the corner away from everyone and isolated. When we asked why this discrimination, we are told because of the dog. I confirmed it is a service dog. They still didn't want us to sit in the normal setup. The manager came and confirmed the same thing. WORST experience!! We left the place as I refuse to eat after being disrespected!STAY Away!!</Text>

Good ambience, good quality and good service but the food lacks the flavour and taste. Sakoon - Mountain view is still the best.< /Review>

<review>Birthday party dinner. Service lousy. Food took long time. Overpriced. Waiter brought all naans at one time for table of six. We’re warm at best when served. Not happy. Won’t be back. Fremont location nice. They wouldn’t have let this happen. Besides all this forced to leave a big tip because of six people. Never do that again.< /review><user>116545658626284288408<//user>< Pictures>

*Quality gone down *
The place was good 3 months ago when it was new. Now the number of items has reduced, quality has gone down and the service is really (really) bad. I need to reduce rating from 5 to 2.</review>

Buffet was sub par.
Sikh kebabs were strange tasting.
Tandoori chicken was ,eh.
Nan was decent.
About $17 bucks for lunch.
There's better to be had in the area at cheaper prices.

Review fix:
I've had saffron rice here 7 times before, each time time satisfied, and this time I took my friends and mom to share them the authentic experience. To our disappointment, there was turmeric but no saffron or any hint of its flavor. The waiter insisted that it was saffron though my nose knows that it wasn't. Dropping 2 stars from my earlier review for the bad experience. Be warned!< /Text>

<Review>Very bad experience! Poorly staffed, completely chaotic, they made us wait for more than an hour despite a reservation. It would have been much more pleasant if they told the truth about wait time in the first place, instead they kept lying to everyone that the wait time was 20 minutes. Even after 2 hours of being in the restaurant, nothing was served! Poor food, poor service and very poor management! I wish I could give it negative stars!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Took 14 people from work to this place today . We were all there for the first time . Loved the food , good quality , not too spicy or greasy . Just perfect

The only reason why it's a 3 star and not a five star is coz the actual food during the buffet is tucked inside a corner and the lines run very very very long ( about 35+people) . . had to wait 23 minutes in the food line to get my first plate and then didn't want to get back in the line . Wish they had a center table or laid it out somewhere outside so it's better approachable and the line moves faster . This was a horrendous wait for a single plate during buffet . And it was only a Wednesday afternoon .. am not sure what happens during Fridays or peak rush hour ..

However I do plan to go back along with my family in a hope that the management can think of creative moves on how to keep the lines short . The older place had a nice table in between that was stocked with food and people could get to then from both directions and didn't block everyone else around me while I was taking food by blocking the other 5 trays tucked closely near it.< /text>

<Text>This Sakoon is better than the mountain view Sakoon. The menu seems to be different, less crowded for dinner but crowded for lunch buffet. The dinner entree portion sizes are good and the service is nice. I would recommend this place for Indian dinner place in santa Clara. Their Jaipuri bhindi is really good. Overall it's a good Indian restaurant.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb58b561f5e4f:0xa020305e3839e21d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

First time visited here yesterday, for dinner.. quality of food was below average.. especially Goat curry was the worst I ever had ... also, had to wait almost 1 hour (despite not so much crowd) ..however , while billing, they came and  apologized for long wait and gave $8 discount - I appreciated their gesture ... but I hv waited longer at other places , for food worth the wait ... so , I hope they would work on the quality of food ...<//review>

<Text>This review is for the weekend buffet. Overall buffet is yummm... Number of items are relatively less compared to Ulvachuru but whatever is available is delicious. If i have to point out one improvement, i would recommend little bigger dinning tables. It hardly suffices 3 people, let alone 4.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>They have the worst service. I came here on a Friday afternoon at 2.15pm and they allowed us inside, after 10 minutes they told us “plz take anything you want, we will be taking off the buffet dishes”. What do they expect.. we have to eat everything in 10 minutes.. when they closing in the 10 min why did they intake 5 of us? Very rude behavior by the staff and the manager itself was rude n irresponsible..< /Text>< Time>

It’s nice not having to drive all the way to Mountain View anymore to go to Sakoon. If you live in Santa Clara / closer to San Jose, I highly recommend this location.< /Review>

<review>Extremely bad experience!! The lady at front desk was extremely rude,  despite the reservation they made us wait for over an hour after continuously lying that the wait time was 20 minutes to tens of people. Finally after 70 minutes of wait, we were seated at a pathetic table, the food arrived in another hour, below average food , nobody was listening, completely chaotic! Never ever stepping in this restaurant again, spoiled Valentines Eve wasting 3 hours at this horrible place, returned with headache!<//review><Rating>1< /Rating><Time>1550213549998</Time>< Name>

<Review>Three and a half stars for food -- very wide selection on the lunch buffet, quality vegetable dishes, obviously fresh ingredients, but not as spicy as I had expected -- I'm a baby boomer from midwestern USA and didn't grow up with spicy food, but have learned to enjoy it, and wanted a bit more kick in these dishes. Also, the lamb rogan josh was chewy, and the chicken dishes were way overcooked and tough. Two stars for service/experience; we arrived at 11:30 for the lunch buffet, were told it would be five minutes or so before it was ready, but it wasn't available till 11:45. By the time I was ready for a second plate the buffet line was very long -- about a ten-minute queue, so the place is very popular just after noon. Other places nearby have better food and less crowding.< /Review>< Pictures>

The buffet isn't organized well and there isn't enough space to make orderly lines and move quickly. It's set against a wall, which means there's only one point of "entry" for those picking up their first round, those coming back for seconds and for the servers bringing fresh food. The food itself was just okay, not as good as the Castro street location. The dining area was fine, no complaints.
I picked up food here another day and the food was much better than my last experience. The naans were soft and the paneer peshawari was delicious. Dahi kabab was missing some chutney, too bland for me. It's a 3 star experience, and I hope it gets better with time.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Amazing food! Much needed good ambience restaurant in the Bay area! Love the dal makhani, pindi chhole and kadhai paneer. Highly recommend it.
We also tried the buffet once and it was amazing - total value for money - had a number of veg, non veg, chaat and dessert items and everything was very tasty.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>It is a worst experience ever a customer could get inspite of having reservation. It is newly opened in this location and they took reservations through OpenTable. When reached before 10 mins of our reserved time slot, there is a long queue and we are said we are in waitlist and we have to sign up. What’s the point of reservation then???? They argued that OpenTable did the overbooking , but who is responsible for that?! Can’t they pull up a list of emails and notify about overbooking. They are truly technically challenged. I would rather choose a place true to commitment. The worst experience ever!!</text>< pictures>

< Review>
I had dinner with my son today. People and service was okay. Food not up to the mark, lamb vindaloo was too much of vinegar taste, overpowering vinegar was even hard to eat, had to send back that dish did not get or expect refund for this. Chicken chetenad was good gravy flavor, chicken was over cooked though. Naan breads, and rumali roti was okay.

I still miss the Bombay garden that it used to be. Now the whole look and ambiance has changed. If food quality improves I might visit again, but right now not fully up to mark in quality and taste.<//Review>

<Time>1547248912010</Time><Rating>4</Rating><Review>The food is very good for a buffet, especially the appetizers (veggie cutlets and pakodas). The place can get very crowded and the placement of buffet tables does not help. The naan brought to table is great. The desserts (gulab jamoon, halwa and khalakhand)  were good. Overall a very good experience very similar to Mountain View & Fremont location. The ambience has is good but the place can get loud on crowded days. The again big crowds usually mean good food.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
They helped a close relative so I reached out. They charge $100 for a consultation, which is fine. However, I asked if they could take a look at a few details surrounding my case before a full consultation (it's a very complicated case). They refused, which is fine as well. However, offering a chance to hear some details for 2 minutes, or even just reading a few paragraphs, would have been nice. I didn't want to pay without knowing, for sure, that we had a chance. Otherwise they seem nice and I'm sure they do a fine job.< /Review>

<Review>They have always being very informative and paying attention to all the details concerning my wife's  immigration process.  It is also important to mention that their email responses were always very prompt. Everyone is at least bilingual in their Practice.

I came to meet with Wilson the day after I lost my job due to my 5 months green card delays. Wilson was extremely professional and offered instant solutions to my current issue. The price is very reasonable. It actually felt very therapeutic after the consultation because he actually understands my struggle of being an immigrant. I highly recommend using his service!< /Text>

Wilson and his team at KPB have been very efficient in communicating the immigration process for my mother and I. Although still through the process, Yosef, one of his associates has been with me through this whole process informing me of updates or documents required. The option to communicate through email is a plus as well.<//Text>

We had a great time working with Wilson and his team. Very responsive to all of our questions from the beginning to after our case was finished.

We had initially tried filing ourselves, but ran into issues understanding the legalese of the forms. It was like hitting an "easy button" once Wilson stepped in. Many thanks to him and his team, and would highly recommend to anyone else.</review>

6 years ago when I moved to the United States, I would need to make one of the most important choice in my life. Who would be my immigration lawyer?
Well, I can tell you that I couldn't have made a better choice. Always open to answer your requests, besides being extremely agile and practical making everything happen with the least possible stress.
Thank you very much Wilson for being the best with your clients.Always 5 stars to you my friend.<//text>

I called this joke of a law firm to ask a question whether they can handle a specific case, and they wanted to charge me $100 for the answer. Are you even serious here? Why would I pay you if you can't do the job?</Review>

KPB is a trustable and reliable law firm and I would recommend them for anyone who is looking for a good & quick service for their needs. They are very responsive and support you all the way and is exactly the kind of law firm you can rely on for yours' and your family needs. We worked with Wilson Purves and he is very professional & communicates effectively to get the job done.</review>

Had the pleasure of registering a business with Wilson Purves and his assistant Johana E..

Every time I had any additional questions I would contact Wilson and he would respond immediately.

Our first consultation (in person) was professional and process was explained plain and simple.

Happy to say business was successfully registered.<//Review>

We’ve been to a few immigration lawyers and we were very quick to say that our case is not a winning case. KPB was different, open, friendly and told us the best way we can apply for a visa is to go back to the UK and apply from there. He made us see the light at the end of the tunnel, was realistic and wants to help us with our case.  A lawyer that seems to care ... or at least it gives you that positive feeling no matter what the outcome.</text>

Initially, when I'm searching for an attorney, Wilson was always available and quick to reply to my all emails with tons of questions I had.  He responded very quickly and received my case within a very short time and their team Alejandro, Pawel they immediately start working with my case. I just started working with them and I'm really happy and grateful. I'll keep you posted...<//text>< UserId.>

<review>I went to the office to help me with the H1B visa application process. Everything took almost 1 year, in all this process the office was always present, revised step by step with me, and prepared me very well for the interview in Brazil. My visa was approved, and even then the office supported me until I returned to the United States. Lawyer Pawel and Eleonora were two wonderful people in this very delicate period for me.
I couldn't recommend better and totally professional people for us immigrants who are looking for solutions in that country, and with all certainty, my next process I will get them again.</review>< Gmap_id>

Got more than I paid for. Wilson is amazing! Unlike a lot of folks who would try to lure you to take their service, he was honest about the case and first made sure that he transparently conveyed the nuances of the immigration system. He is updated about the ever changing rules.<//text>

Wilson did a great job for my company. I always thought that my company would not be successful in getting a H1B for my employee as it is not a Fortune 500. We are very small, less than 20 employees, but Wilson Purves got it done.</Review>

< Review>
Anything related to immigration can be a bit daunting and stressful to do alone. I tried to educate myself on the naturalization process and realized that it made more sense to go with a trusted professional. I had my first meeting with Wilson Purves. Words can't express how great him and his team treated me through the process. It all took about a year, but I'm so thankful that I had them by my side the entire time to help answer any questions. We don't know what we don't know. This is why having a team like KPB Immigration made all of the difference for me. If you're still on the fence, do it. You won't regret it.</Review>

<Text>Wilson was recommended to us by a friend, and I am so glad she did, he is great! I recommend Wilson to any one that might need help with an immigration case. Since our first meeting he asked all kinds of questions, so that he could best help us. He also answered all the questions that we have and gave very clear explanation of the possible routes for our case, what I appreciated the most is how honest he was. I really liked how organized Wilson and his stuff are. Hisae  gave us a list of documents we will need right away but also the ones we will need for our future appointments, which was a huge help because your process doesn't take longer than what it needs to. The other the thing I really liked is that because Wilson is so experienced and keeps up with the immigration laws he was able to give us updates if things were taking longer than usual. For me the only thing that I was dreading was the interview with the immigration officer,  however Dorothy (our immigration lawyer) was great!, she talked to us before the appointment and answered all the questions we had, gave us an idea of what will happen during the interview and really put me an ease before the appointment she was the BEST!

The whole team was really involved during the whole process and even after the interview, they were sure to follow up with us.

I definitely recommend them if you need help with an immigration case.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Attorney Wilson is a wonderful person and very professional!!!

His communication via email, phone, or text messages is always there to answer your questions.

We are very grateful he took our case and moved fast.

We hired another attorney whom we worked with for 2 years and she did not perform.  We had to let her go.

Attorney Wilson is highly recommended and is always pleasant to work with .

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I am very pleased to have engage KPB immigration law firm on April 2020 for their help with my naturalization application for U.S. citizenship.    It was after months of endless search for a immigration law firm who is willing to undertake my case.    The search experience was stressful.  I contacted Van Der Hout LLP, spoke to one of the associate, who thereafter did not respond to my email on how to proceed.    I also contacted Fragoman immigration law firm which helped me to apply for my green card in year 2015.    One of the senior partners responded my email and agreed to undertake my case.   I was asked to upload all my personal information on Fragoman case portal.   After doing so, I patiently waited for respond.  Week after week I followed up with calls and emails and yet there was no respond.   I was extremely frustrated for being kept in the dark for over a month.
I restarted the search on google and came across KPB.     Wilson Purves who is one of the partners took my call and has then personally attended to the whole application process.   My case is actually not complicating!  Wilson and his assistant Valeria are great.    They were attentive and timely in helping me to put together all the required documentation and completed the application forms.  Great team work!    KPB is genuine in wanting to help people cause they truly understand the emotional insights.
My application has been submitted to U.S. Immigration department in May 2020 and is a waiting process now.

Thank you Wilson and Valeria.   I highly recommend KPB .

The amount of time and energy these cases take are tremendous and the amazing team of dedicated people that truly care is what makes them so special. Going into this long process of immigration takes a lot of energy, we ended with great results and it is thanks to this law firm. They have dedicated team of people willing to go the extra mile and really keep your family together! The process is long, and tiring but worth the end result. Thank you for being part of our family! And the long hours that you dedicated to us. We are truly grateful!!</review>< Rating>

When I think of Law Firms in general, I always get a bit intimidated when I have to do business with them because of my lack of understanding of the legal system and how lawyers generally operate - not so with this Law Firm!

KPB, Wilson Purves and his team in particular, were great in that they were able to help my wife and I in making our process of immigration simple and straightforward- they guided us through each and every step we needed to do in order to make our case simple and easy - which is a quality I can appreciate given my lack of knowledge with law and immigration in general.

I would highly recommend KPB Law Firm, and would use their services again for the future!</text>

I highly recommend Christopher to all of my friends and I’m recommending him to you guys. You will have that peace of mind, knowing that you have one of the best professionals in the field.

Had a great experience with Wilson Purves and his staff recently. Him and his team were very knowledgeable, had great communication, and were always responsive to questions throughout a long case.  I have and will continue to recommended Wilson to people I know looking for the best immigration attorney in San Francisco.< /review>

We would like to say Thank You so much!! to Christopher and his wonderful, very knowledgeable staff for helping my wife get her Permanent Residence card. When we first met Christopher at his Santa Rosa Office he quickly put us at ease. He guided us step by step on the process and how long it was going to take to get an interview with the Immigration Department.  After leaving his office he said to my wife “don’t worry everything will be alright”. He was right!! We would like to acknowledge our Case Manager Andrea and Chelsea for helping us put together all the necessary documents for our case. Thank you as well to our other Case Manager Brenda Chavez for your  guidance and preparing us for our interview. They were all very efficient too at getting back to us with all our inquiries either by email or phone and answering all of our concerns with great detail. We were also very grateful to have Liliana Gallelli, someone who has great expertise,
who accompanied us to our Interview, which went really well. I would most definitely recommend anyone looking for help in immigration matters to look no further and I highly recommend Kerosky Purves & Bogue,  LLP.< /text>

Wilson & his team are awesome! I was referred to his office back in 2013 by the Consulate Genaral of Mexico, San Francisco. after I wasted 2 years of my time With a bad lawyer who simply just took my money. At any rate after joining Mr Wilson team he got me the work permit & I was able to obtain my drivers license.
Few months later, cancelled my deportation scheduled out of the country in 2014 due to a Wet and wreckless I got in 2011.
Wilson and his team we’re next to me the whole time I was at WAR with immigration! There was no ups and downs. mainly Just HEY you got approved . My wife is a U.S citizens I file paper through marriage & i became a U.S resident in 2017 with a shot of becoming U.S citizen in two years after that.
if it wasn’t for Wilson & his whole team I wouldn’t be able to have a bright future ahead of me . Thank you guys I will for ever be  grateful!</review>

Excellent legal representation that deserves an excellent review!
I desperately needed legal assistance with a pending I-751 that was in jeopardy due to a separation. The USCIS called me in for an interview and  we had a very limited amount of time to straighten things out and prepare for the appointment. I worked with W. Purves which was very comforting and helpful, he's competent, collected, and polite. The communication was great, throughout the entire process I always felt safe and taken care of. On the day of the actual interview I was joined by C. Keating, whom I hadn't met before. I don't do well with new people, but she was one of the few exceptions. She was very approachable and understanding about my situation and involved herself during the interview. I feel like I didn't thank her enough for the great help. I highly recommend this law firm, everyone was great, including the paralegals. Thank you :)</Review>

Or if you feel like you're not being helpful return the money you took at the first place because you aren't the guy who's an expert and your your opinion doesn't help, at least not in the case of discussion.

I have had a great experience with KPB Immigration Law Firm as they helped me getting my E2 visa and building my company in San Francisco, California. I can only recommend KPB for anyone looking for a professional, reliable, and efficient team of lawyers in San Francisco enabling people from around the world to immigrate in the US to accomplish their dreams.</Review>

I had the pleasure of speaking to attorney Purves concerning some persons who are undocumented and needed some Immigration advice. He was very pleasant to all of them and was very frank concerning each of their immigration situation. Everyone who to visited him felt very comfortable with sharing their story. His fees are very reasonably. He is very flexible in accommodating everyone's work schedule and can travel  within the Bay Area. He speaks Spanish and has a lot of experience. If you need an Immigration attorney, contact this attorney. He can help you throughout the United States since he represents federal issues.< /Review>

<Text>Our first consultation with Wilson was very positive . He had a very genuine character , which in this time we live in is hard to find in most people . It was a long journey but with a positive outcome and I’m so grateful to Wilson for all his hard work . Anything to do with immigration can be very difficult , emotional and stressful , but we never lost hope and were certain our attorney was doing his best . Very professional always , I would highly recommend , best to all of you in your journeys to come , Mary Lazo< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I have worked with Wilson Purves and his staff of Kerosky Purves & Bogue since 2011 on several complicated immigration cases.  The outcome was positive, thanks to competent counsel, great attention to detail, great sensitivity to the special circumstances of the cases and persistent pursuit of all legal avenues available.
I found Mr. Purves and hist staff exceptionally dedicated and unfailingly friendly to work with and recommend them very highly.<//Review>

Mr Purves is an excellent immigration attorney.  Prior to retaining this firm I hired two other attorneys who offered me no results whatsoever.  My family is already working with them and they visit him regularly at his San Francisco offices.</Text>

Wilson Purves is an outstanding attorney. He helped our firm when we needed advice regarding an H1b visa. I would definitely use his services again.<//Review>

In this day with a white supremacist leading the most powerful nation of the planet it's better be very prepared for the worst,  that is the reason why my family and I are looking for the best immigration attorneys . Please don't waste your time seating in your house waiting to be deported for ICE, call now and look for a  appointment with Purves and his colleagues.< /text>

I have been working with Wilson Purves for few years now for my citizenship and to apply for my wife's GreenCard and then now to apply for my wife's citizenship. He is the best and I really enjoy working with him because he is thorough in his process with a tremendous experience in immigration laws and always helping with a smile. For me, he became the reference to ask for any immigration questions and he always respond quickly and even remembers all his clients. I've already referred few friends to him for immigration cases and I highly recommend him to anyone who needs help in any immigration issues.<//Text>

<Text>Wilson and his team both in the SF and LA office were extremely helpful through my adjustment of status. At the very start of my process Mr. Purves brought to my attention that the way I had originally intended on going would not be efficient if successful at all, saving me a lot of time and effort. Thanks to his attention from the start we were able to correct the way I would go about it and now have successfully completed the process.
A special thank you to Eleonora Mazza at the LA office who supported Wilson with my case and was very responsive to any questions that I had.<//Text>< pics>

<text>The service that was provided by Wilson Purves was really amazing. He not only gave consultation, he guided me to get my LPR Status back in my immigration process. Really the service rendered cannot be assigned by just clicking the stars and i m so thankful to Wilson. More than aiming to charge the fees from the client they particularly figure out the solution for the challenges they are meant to face. Its a wonderful service of KPB and my sincere thanks to them.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have been associated with them for over 5 years and they consistently treat their clients with the utmost respect and consideration.  I hear from their clients how other attorneys have taken their money but did not deliver.  These clients unanimously endorse Kerosky, Purves and Bogue Law firm for attending to their immigration cases in a timely, professional manner and they produce results!  I am proud to be associated with this law firm in helping qualifying, worthy immigrants get legal help with a broken immigration system.

< Review>
Christopher Kerosky was an immigration attorney for my mother and my uncle. Their cases were different from each other and very complicated. I often helped my Mom and my uncle to translate from/into English when they went for their meetings with Mr. Kerosky. Their office staff always stayed on top of things, they were professional and punctual. They spent a great deal of time and effort to work on the cases. I worked with immigration attorneys myself and I know the difference! My uncle is a US citizen, and my mother has a permanent green card, thanks to hard work of Christopher Kerosky and his associates.</Review>

<text>I am a criminal lawyer  and am always looking for competent, creative and caring lawyers to provide immigration advice and representation to my clients.  Kerovsky, Purves and Bogue, LLP fit this bill.  I have worked with Chris Kerovsky and Liliana Galleli on cases where my clients are facing dire consequences if convicted of a criminal offense.  Chris and Liliana clearly have a great deal of experience and competence in the immigration law field and I am confident that my clients are getting the best immigration defense possible.  I would and do highly recommend them as immigration counsel.< /text>< pictures>

We do appreciate everything Christopher and his team  have done to help us to prepare a political asylum case. All the work, including paperwork, advises and preparing legal documents was done very professionally and in timely manner. We had a bad experience with our previous lawyer so we were glad to find an attorney who cares about his clients and does his job the best.
Nothing but good things to say! Always responsive with questions, suggestions, and follow-up.
We would highly recommend your attorney office for anybody who seeks an immigration advise.<//Review>< Pictures>

My cousin found and connected me up with Christopher, his assistant Hisae, and his team at Kerosky, Purves & Bogue LLP. After a rough interaction with my previous lawyer, the world of law and laywers left a severely bitter taste in my mouth and made me very distrustful and wary. However, after the initial meeting and consultation with Christopher, I had absolutely no doubt that I was in safe hands and I had absolutely nothing to worry about. They have offices throughout California but I dealt primarily with the San Francisco and Santa Rosa office.

Both Christopher and Hisae reply to their e-mails and phone calls remarkably fast, and they will explain everything down to the last detail for you. They will walk you through your situation, give you the options, and assist you through them. I had never left an appointment without my questions answered thoroughly, and I ALWAYS left feeling reassured, relaxed, and confident.

I worked directly hand-in-hand with Christopher and his team for a better part of 7-8 years (2009-2017) in regards to my immigration case, and I honestly cannot thank them enough for everything that they've done. Their work ethic and knowledge on all things immigration is remarkable, but most importantly I knew that they had my back no matter what happens. They treat you like family, they check-up on you like family, and they reassure you like family. In all honestly, they are the ONLY law group I recommend to anyone who has any immigration questions or concerns. I do not and will not trust any other law group other than Kerosky, Purves & Bogue.

If you have any immigration issues, I STRONGLY urge you to call or e-mail them. They ARE your advocate, and they truly do care about what happens to you.

Because of Christopher and his team, I no longer have to be afraid and can finally come out of the shadows after so long. They thoroughly relieved me and my husband's worries, and I am forever indebted to the folks at Kerosky, Purves & Bogue.

Thank you, Christopher and team, times a billon. Thank you for coming into our lives and becoming a part of our family, and thank you for all that you have done for me. We cannot thank you guys enough!!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Wilson and his assistant Alejandra Solorio are helping us with the process for my husband, we have already been in the process for almost a year and they always help us with so many questions that we have every time we fill out a new form. Very good customer service responds very quickly either by phone or email.

(Translated by Google) Attorney Wilson Purves and his team worked on my case efficiently and honestly. My case was defined in the time and form that they said from the beginning. This law firm works without deception and without false promises. If a case has a solution they help and solve it; but if there is no solution, they say it openly.
What I paid to fix my case was something fair and worth it, also I was able to make monthly payments and comfortable without spending economic hardships. In your office they treat you with kindness and consideration and that is why I have recommended them to my friends who have also been very satisfied with their work. I am particularly grateful to them that I am already legally in this country and I was able to get a better job and even buy my house. May God bless my lawyer and his entire team.

Esta firma de abogados trabaja sin enga&os y sin falsas promesas. Si un caso tiene solucion ellos ayudan y lo resuelven; pero si no hay solucion, lo dicen abiertamente.
Lo que yo pague por arreglar mi caso fue algo justo y valio la pena, ademas pude hacer pagos mensuales y comodos sin pasar apuros economicos. En su oficina te tratan con amabilidad y consideracion y por eso los he recomendado a mis amigos que tambien han quedado muy satisfechos con su trabajo. Particularmente les estoy muy agradecida por que ya estoy legalmente en este pais y asi pude obtener un mejor empleo y hasta comprar mi casita. Que Dios bendiga a mi abogado y a todo su equipo de trabajo.< /text>
