<Review>Eight Tables is one of our favorite fine dining experiences! I love the decore and each dishes. I was hesitant at first because I never tried fine dining Chinese. It's always been fast take outs or family style dining. Eight tables did not disappoint! In fact, they far exceeded our expectations, so much that we can't wait to come back when the menu changes.</Review><user_name>C Lee<//user_name>< Response>

Eight Tables is just a phenomenal restaurant. Everything about it from the moment you walk in, the ambiance really hits you. Then the fact that there are eight tables makes it an interesting atmosphere in the restaurant. The service was very accommodating and even realized that my brother was a lefty. The food was outstanding. Starting with a very varietal first course that brought flavors that were shared in later courses. The chefs table in the kitchen gave my family a good chance to see what goes on in this hectic kitchen. It was quite clean and very organized. Overall this is probably one of the best restaurants I have ever been too and I’m bound to come again.</Text>

This was the best dinner of my life!  My two girls and I are so lucky to have enjoyed an amazingly fantastic meal here. And as fortunate as we are to have one of the few tables at Eight Tables by George Chen, we were even more blessed to be able to eat inside the kitchen at this incredible restaurant.

The food is beyond comparison and the Chef’s Table gave us front row seats to the stage where the magic happens. We also received a  history lesson about Chinese culture as well as an education in wine that was shared with passion and enthusiasm.

I don’t think any of us will forget this night. Here are photos of the food.</Text>

<review>Absolutely magical and unforgettable experience! We came for my birthday (and turned into an engagement💍😃) expecting to sit in the dining room but as a surprise they sat us at the chefs table. The food was delicious, perfectly prepared, with wonderful wine pairing. Chef Chen came by and explained many of the dishes too! We even got to take a picture with the skilled staff! Truly amazing service as well!! Highly recommend< /review>< pictures>

<Date>1538293833026< /Date><rate>5<//rate><review>This is our second Michelin rated restaurant we have tried. Eight Tables deserves the star. This is a culinary experience! We ordered the Chef's Menu ($325 per person, 12 courses), not the main menu ($225 per person) which includes 2 more courses than the main menu (10 courses). Chef George Chen beautifully creates and builds up each course. The textures and flavors are amazing! Not one course disappointed. By the ninth course, you start feeling full. The service is the best we have ever received- uber attentive and synchronized. Even though this restaurant is expensive, the staff is down to earth. We celebrated my husband's birthday here- it definitely was a gift. Chef George Chen visits every table to welcome his guests and explains the first course. When you first arrive, you are not really sure where the entrance is, but the valet person unlocks the gate and escorts you to the entrance of the "house". You take the elevator to the second floor. Chef George Chen wants you to feel like you're at his home. It's a dining experience of a lifetime.<//review>< pictures>

The atmosphere is pretty intimate, each table feels like a private space. George came around a couple times to introduce the dishes. Nice guy!
The food itself has very traditionally Chinese flavors. My Chinese parents especially loved this experience. The dishes felt familiar and were recognizable for them.
Overall, would highly recommend, especially to those ABCs who want to treat/impress their parents 😅. Just don't show them the bill...</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOq2OIRvSuTJmhvU1OMMsxdFT_Qc4WnSyzCfeJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_0qHwkR1Q1DzUYy6acBEBOWQatxrp_pjiXLPR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

You walk down an alley and at the end is number 8. The space was on the brighter side but cozy, the staff very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious although alittle too much duck for me. Great cocktails and superb wine collection. 3 friends and I had a reservation for 8:30pm, after the final dessert course it was almost quarter to midnight.< /Review>

The best restaurant experience I've had so far. We got lucky and got moved to the chef's table in the kitchen. The food was delicious and we ordered the extra dishes like the A5 wagyu. We had the usual 10 course menu and we added the abalone and A5 wagyu beef and broccoli.

We also had a great durian cocktail that was super delicious.</review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>1. We were locked outside the door for 10+mins. No one answered the phone listed on the door. We knocked the door like crazy and finally got someone’s attention to open the door for us. Can you image this is the experience when you visit the such high-end restaurant?

2. They offered the cutlery saying that they were made by pearl. Several minutes after they took them away(we didn’t use them yet) without explanation, which made us so confused. They offered us another set later.

3. Food is just ok — it’s decent but definitely overpriced. You can get much better food at this price.

Wouldn’t come back again.</Text>< pictures>

Impeccable! Though a new spot in town, it looks like the people are giving Eight Tables two thumbs up. My thumbs are sore from being held up for Chef George Chen too.

I usually don't go for $$$$ Chinese food, because I always feel ripped off afterwards when my mom could have cooked a meal for a fraction of the price and 100x the taste. However, Eight Tables was one of a few exceptions where the food, combined with experience, is worth every penny. I can't wait to see a Michelin star or two soon for you, which is inevitable. Just glad I got to visit before it becomes impossible to get a reservation!

If you want an overview of the magic, just look at my pictures. The evening was beautiful and nothing short of perfection, and you get to learn a little bit about Chinese history along the way too.</text>

An extraordinary meal served by a chef who truly cares!  An extraordinary exploration of the best Chinese food you'll ever have, done with a modern twist but still respecting tradition.  The service is perfect.  The room is wonderful.  A top top restaurant in SF!</Review>

<Time>1556321744608<//Time><review>This is a unique and memorable dining experience.   Everything is designed to make the dinner comfortable in elegant surroundings, the best service and of course the food is incredible.  The wine pairing is so well thought through.  One in our party does not drink alcohol but was thoughtfully paired with various teas to match the courses and a pink lemonade exactly the same color as the rose champagne  that began the meal.    This is a level of creative and expertly executed Chinese food that is new to San Francisco.    It is pricey, but the evening was so completing a delightful  dining experience that it was worth every buck.< /review></record></dataset><record>

What a great meal! Service was really excellent. I took my mom for her birthday, and all the staff stopped by to greet her. A few of the Cantonese speaking wait staff also made an attempt to talk to us and describe some of the dishes.

Everything was presented beautifully and most dishes were really tasty. Especially liked the fish dish (forgot the name now). Everyone starts with the Jiu Gong Ge (nine essential flavors) which was a really nice introduction to the meal. The desserts fell a bit flat but overall the meal was great.

Would definitely recommend this for a special occasion. Love that they highlight Chinese cuisine in a refined manner.</text>

<Review>A bit hard to find the space. But if you ask staff at chinalive(owned by the same owner), they will show you the way.  High end Chinese food.  This place is still new... Give this place some time , it will climb up the ladder of Michelin.</Review>< pics>

My friend and I meet some friends here for lunch.  The restaurant was very clean and more roomy then it looked from the outside. The waiter took our drink orders right away and our meal order also.  It took the food a long time to arrive after ordering.  The food was very good and we had plenty to eat.  It's a god restaurant to visit in a busy Chinatown.<//text>

<Review>Attention to detail was great but the food was just okay and the service was slow. I was hoping the courses would implement all of the 9 tastes introduced in the first course, but was disappointed that my favorite sour bite was not a part of the following courses. Not as good as Alan Wong's or Ledbury in my opinion.<//Review><response>None</response>< pictures>

The service and atmosphere were outstanding. As good as it gets.

We really enjoyed the food, I can't say it's the best fixed menu I've ever had, some dishes were just ok, but the overall experience is certainly worth it.

The cocktail list has a lot of super interesting and theatrical presentations.<//Review>

<review>Good food. Veggie pot stickers and spinach soup are great  for starters and followed by a dish of cashew prawns with brown rice, perfect meal for two!</review>< Pics>

Our 8 course Tasting Menu (online here: https://chinalivesf.com/fine-dining-in-san-francisco/eight-tables-menu/) does not offer Veggie Pot Stickers, Spinach Soup, Cashew Prawns or Brown Rice.

Finally a true Chinese fine dining experience!!!! And with a front of the house staff that rivals the French laundry in attention to detail. Absolutely superb. Can't wait to see eight tables get a few Michelin stars. (And this was soooo much better than Benu in every way.)< /text>

I went back for a second visit and found the food and service to be just as outstanding as my first visit. They added a new mushroom/pea leaves/ bean sprout dish whose flavors and contrasting textures really popped. The juicy crunch of the pea leaves (often tough in other restaurants) and bean sprouts provided a perfect foil to the buttery shiitakes (in maggi sauce, I think). Previous favorite dishes like the velvet chicken, hongshao pork, crunchy fried rice, marinated clam, foie gras dumpling with tuile, Napa cabbage purse, sea grass prawn, iberico charsiu, sesame basil mochi, etc were once again flawless in execution. The amount of labor required to produce these dishes must be mind boggling. The staff and sommelier were a pleasure to deal with and the cocktails and desserts were exceptional. Pro tip: skip lunch before coming here.</text>

Well it's sad to say but I will not be doing business here. Twice now I've called in and order and it's been incorrect and if you show up at 11 o'clock will tell you that the cook is on break and that your food will be at least 20 minutes out. To day I waited an extra 30 minutes only to have my order incorrect. Recommendations increase staff in pay attention to your customer.< /review>

Most of there breakfast food is light and always made perfectly.  We have been there over a dozen times and never had an issues with food quality or service.  I recommend the their Mocha, it's amazing.  They also do fancy art on top of your espresso based drinks.  We love the time they take to make each order special.  This is an A+ Cafe!<//Review><GmapID>0x80d955bc5f25c6f1:0x7b87c83c62cad12f<//GmapID></record>

This cafe has very lovely and delicious lattes! The breakfast croissant sandwich is one of my faves and I've tried a couple of their other breakfast items, all taste great! The staff is very friendly and helpful.</Text>

Great local joint for hand crafted coffee and really good food at a reasonable price. I like to grab the mission burrito if I'm on the run,  otherwise the waffles are my favorite! Great job village!</Text>

< Review>
Avocado toast (Ok, ok, I'm not a hipster, but I didn't want a full blown sandwich) was bomb, asked for extra tomato since they were out of spinach...no problems at all! Red eye (extra caffeinated coffee drink) got me up & at 'em for sure. Staff rediculously friendly and helpful. Only reason for 4/5 is location...tucked away in mission area.<//Review>

Great little neighborhood cafe. The coffee is some of the best I've had in Cali and the new menu is both delish and healthy. I'm partial to breakfast food -- and the extensive breakfast menu doesn't dissapoint. It's a great spot for a quick coffee, for studying (free wifi), and most importantly, a delicious brunch.

All in all a well-run, reasonably priced neighborhood cafe with great food, personalized service and a chill atmosphere. Viva village cafe (and locally-owned businesses)!!<//review>

We have dined here for more than 40 years and my parents and neighbours since the day it opened.
I have never had a major complaint regarding our food or service, until now. My wife (who has only been there with me three times made a reservation for my birthday. She made it for a Sunday night and the manager (or whoever she was) even called back to get a time as she had not noted it before. We arrived and was surprised that the restaurant was closed! Obviously, there was some misunderstanding, so we ended up elsewhere. My wife E-Mailed the restaurant explaining what happened and how disappointed we were. After a few days of receiving no reply, I called the restaurant tonight. I asked to speak with the manager, the woman (with a marked french accent) asked how she could help me. I  to explain what had happened... honestly, I was more upset that had failed to reply to the E-Mail than I was for the reservation... before I could finish my sentence she yelled at me that NO ONE TOOK SUCH A RESERVATION... IT DID NOT HAPPEN. WE ARE CLOSED SUNDAY & MONDAY and no one would have taken such a reservation.  We must have made it at another restaurant as there is one with the similar name on Ventura Blvd. I tried to explain that we had come there for years so we certainly knew which place my wife was calling... in fact my wife recognized her voice from the time she called to make the reservation. She was shouting so loud that my wife could hear her through the phone.
I told that her attitude to yell a long time customer (or ANY customer for that matter) was just plain wrong. She replied again "it did not happen, all of our staff have been here for more than 30 years and no one would make such a mistake! I told that her attitude was appalling and after 40 years we would not be back... she said thank you and hung up. I guess she is without fault and is perfect as we know that SHE took the reservation. I was not seeking any compensation for the mistake, just a simple apology. Truthfully, they should have responded to the E-Mail in the first place. Then this phone conversation would never have occurred
There are too many fine dining establishments in Los Angeles for a place to adopt such an arrogant attitude... many places that have been in business for 40 + years have gone by the wayside.< /review>

This is my absolute favorite place to dine in Los Angeles. I have been here many many times with friends or to simply take myself out for an amazing dinner. There isn't a dish on this menu that I don't enjoy (and I've tried nearly all of them). The staff is wonderful here  and there's always familiar faces whether it's your second time or you're a frequent flyer like myself. I can always count on a delicious, relaxing meal here.< /text>

Beware if you have an infant they are not shy about letting you know they are not welcomed and be prepared to be seated away from the main dining area. Food was sub par for the price. I expected way more of a refined presentation. A night of dining for this price range would have been better at the Americana<//Review>< time>

NO, NO, NO!! I have been running fine dining French & Italian cuisines for 15 years as an owner/operator. I have NEVER been more sickened and embarrassed in an establishment ESPECIALLY when confronted by a manager/owner like I did here.

Learn how to cook Beef Wellington the first damn time and when you cant get it right after the 2nd time DO NOT engage and disrespect your patrons like we are some peasants.

Horrible food and ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE OWNERSHIP!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!< /Review>

The atmosphere was lovely and we were able to be seated with no reservation as the restaurant was not busy.  The owner greeted us at the bar as well.  Our server was a disarming mix of cheery and condescending and the quality of service was just OK.

The cocktails were absolutely amazing, but I found the food to be... just acceptable.  I found it to be bland, and a much simpler recipe than I would serve at home.  The profiteroles were AWFUL, the choux was not rested properly before adding 1-2 too many unbeaten eggs, and I'd expect at least a proper cream filling in a nice restaurant.  I could go on for paragraphs about how bad these profiteroles were and how to make them properly, but I think you get the picture.< /Review><userid>111004101768275004063< /userid></record>

Went here for my brother's high school graduation. The restaurant has a very clean and relaxing atmosphere that really sets you into the mood to try French cuisine. Waiters and waitresses are very kind, service is well checked, and the food is marvelous to try out as well as their desserts. Music is of perfect choice and very soothing. I highly recommend going to this restaurant if you're looking for a French eatery. This was my first restaurant I had ever tried a French dish and it was a perfect and a well done first experience. Five out of five stars is the perfect rating for this location as it is well deserved for its perfection and not a single lack of touch in any aspect of business! I'm happy that Le Petit Château is the place to let me try something new in my life and I urge everyone else to come here!< /review>

This place is terrible. It's very over priced and the food is not good . I took one bite of my salad and had to send it back. The salad had about 10 pieces of spinach and nasty dressing   The owner<//Review>

It might have been. But it wasn't. The service of attendants was excellent. The cost was high. The food was quite good and the menu extensive. So what was the problem?

They have a rule. A most inconvenient rule. They only accept one source of payment. Our group of ten  might confuse the attendants. They simply could not bend the rule. No matter that we were not prepared for this, or that it was our first visit.

The manager spoke with firm and abrupt rudeness. She wasn't interested in our business or that of the friends we would speak to. So out of concern I am speaking! There are many other well priced French Restaurants. Bizou to name one. At Bizou you are treated with respect and not contempt.

Oh yes. The harsh manager did give in to our request and let us pay with 4 credit cards. But made it clear that it would never happen again. Not on our account it won't.

We urge you to find another place of greater quality. Like McDonalds. Or that French fast food place called Jacque en ze Box. Seriously. You can do much better without much effort.<//review>

<Text>We went here for th first time last Saturday after purchasing a Groupon.  The escargot were tougher than shoe leather, sent back.  Service was worse than bad. Portions of the filet medallions small for the price.    Not right when you wait for a waiter and give up and go to the bar yourself.  We were in a room almost totally by ourselves, away from the main dining room  and felt totally forgotten.  Be aware the prices at online menu are not what they actually are at restaurant.  Restaurant much higher than website.  Save your money, dine elsewhere.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80c2be221d778ae7:0x2cc75f2e36b23626</gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1505931145869, 'text': "Leslie, I'm sorry your visit was less than enjoyable.

<Review>Very disappointed, extremely small portions, service with attitude, very over priced and will never patronize again. We ordered two orders of chateaubriand for four of us and we each got the three bites. Complete rip off! The server asked repeatily if we had a coupon. Very insulting.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1473779694019, 'text': 'Matt, you may have seen my comments on Yelp, but I apologize for your poor experience, small portions you received, and the frustration concerning your servers repeated inquiries as to whether you would be using the Groupon we have on offer. Since many of our patrons have used the Groupon, it was never meant to insult. But I can certainly understand you felt it was implicated given your server asked you multiple times. This comes down to simply being more attentive to our guests and hearing them the first time. I will be sure to speak with my team members in order to avoid situations like these in the future. If you have any further questions or concerns, please reach out to us directly. -Andrew'}</Resp>

Good service. Food is average with moderate portion. However, many entrees are over priced, and could possibly be overrated. Atmosphere setting is either cozy or claustrophobic depending angle of perception and where you’re seated.< /Text>

My wife and I went to Le Petit Chateau for our anniversary and loved it. The atmosphere and food were fantasic. I had the steak tartare and french onion soup, my wife had the broiled filet and split pea soup. They made my tartare right at the table which was a treat. We will definitely be back!<//review>

I hadn't heard of Bottlecraft until a coworker had suggested a happy hour here recently and well, you know how it is - I'm not longer surprised that these breweries are located in the once empty commercial spaces in San Diego. Since we're the capital of microbreweries now it only makes sense. Don't get me wrong, it's great to have it as a local industry, and Bottlecraft is a great member of that.

The space isn't to crowded and pretty modern. It has warm glow and had what I like to call a Euro/Ikea feel. In a good way. Reading the list of beers was a bit overwhelming as to me each seemed like a custom creation from a smaller brewery experimenting. I'm totally down with that. I can't remember exactly which beer I had but the addition of watermelon sold me. It was easily drinkable and enjoyable! So the bottom line is there's lots to choose from and the space is clean and simple. Definitely my kind of hangout.< /review>

<review>Small but exceptional selection of beers available in cans and bottles for take-out. I can't speak for all styles, but IPAs, stouts, and sours are all represented extremely well with old favorites and new finds. The IPA cooler has frequent turnover with lots of new releases from Alvarado Street if you like the hazy fruit bombs and Revision for some well balanced whoppers. Plus 24 taps with tasters sizes available. Indoor and outdoor seating. Just bring your own food if you're planning on a meal.</review><date>1546920187087< /date>< UserId.>

A good selection of beers in a lot of styles and price range, plus what I believe were 20 beers on tap. There is a nice outside seating area and an overall friendly atmosphere from staff and patrons.</review>

Super chill vibe, perfect for those #woke yuppies working in the area. People who spin nearby tend to frequent this place afterwards for their much-deservee glass of red wine. Dogs are welcome, as most of them are of a bulldog breed. Lots choices of beer from over a dozen local breweries. They rotate frquently. The restrooms are outside the spot in a nearby hallway, but very clean and modern, especially since their gender-neutral (sorry, ladies, I'm still root'n for ya)< /Review>

Ordered strawberry black tea with pearls and their mango special number 4, both tasty and powerful.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Purchased 2 drinks & got the 3rd free. The drinks were good, but my winter melon drink was in between an ice & hot drink since they probably just added the hot black tea last maybe - so it wasn’t too refreshing. Kind of on the pricier end, not that high quality.< /review>

Great tea all around ! You really can't go wrong here, like seriously. I go at least once a week right after school ! It can get a little busy, but it's still pretty fast and always enjoyable ! Super convenient spot, great snacks, great tea ! Staff is usually very welcoming !</Text>

When you go make sure it's something g you've had before at their place because even if you've had it elsewhere it might not be the same and they won't exchange it. I ordered the winter melon tea and thought it was too strong so I asked for a new one or another drink. They made a big deal out of it and said what drink did I want and when I said what I wanted they said I couldn't? So I chose another one from the same section and they said no. So why tell me I could?? They proceeded to pour the drink out and distribute it to the employees while saying it was good. Mind you I was a very frequent customer and I would buy multiple when I would go. Needless to say that will be the last time I go or recommend it<//text>

The drinks were too sweet the service was sooo bad, first we waited
30 mins to wait when we were first in line cause she had to make another persons drink but there were two workers, second when we ordered the worker rolled her eyes at us, third when we bought it with a credit card we didn’t know we have to give her 25 cents but when she explained we had to do that she said “Sorry you can’t buy these drinks with credit” but the policy was 25 cents to buy with credit. Please don’t go there worst service ever</Review>

Highlands center is a  great  place  to  stop to stock up on some food and drinks at the grocery  store.  Or stop by the pharmacy. There's  plenty  of parking  available  for  all. The people  here are very friendly  and  the prices are reasonable. If  you get the chance stop by and enjoy.<//Review>

IGA or Foods Etc. The store is clean and neat, courterous staff, great produce section, meat section is second to none! There is a full service deli yum! Large selection of alcoholic beverages as well as a good wine selection. Handicapped accessible, good parking and Dry ice is aviable as well. Give'em a try you won't be disapointed! 🌴🐒🐾🐹😷🇱🇷👣< /text>

The place has a laundromat in addition to a couple of Mexican restaurants, a Children's Museum, a t-shirt printing shop, and I believe a souvenir boutique.  All in all, I find it safe and pretty well maintained.</review>

I just kindly say soor not today. It is not fair for all of us. I dont like when they follow and get mad if you dont help. So i say this. The complex needs to hire security guards for the whole parking lot.

The new Paul Mitchell school in San Jose is amazing! So far the schools learning leaders named Kevin, Sonya, and Jessica are all very inspiring and motivating individuals. They walk you through the process of styling and challenge you to reach your full potential. The entire atmosphere of the school is extremely welcoming and the learning process is a ton of fun! I recommend this school for anyone who has a serious interest in hair and wants to take it to the next level! You won't be disappointed!</review>

Friendly staff, helpful stylists. My first visit was for a cut and style. While it did take a longer time than I had expected (they check and double check their work) , I was really happy with both the cut and the color.

My second visit was for a facial. The technician was friendly and very good. My face came out looking soft and healthy.

I will definitely be back soon!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I've had better haircuts at this school than I often get in high-end salons, and the cuts cost maybe a third or quarter of what they're worth. Leslie was fantastic and asked for my input every step of the way. She has amazing cutting skills, and while I'm sad she is graduating, she introduced me to a new stylist and helped me set up an appointment.

The facilities at this location are also top notch! I used to go to the San Diego school, but the facility was much older and they didn't provide as many services. This place even looks like a high end salon inside. You must expect services to take a little longer, but since the work is supervised, your stylist will take their time and do a careful job, which doesn't always happen elsewhere.

I highly recommend this location! Also, the VIP membership is the best deal around. I really want to try their skin services now because of the deep discount.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1465844046498, 'text': 'Hi Amanda,\n\nThank you for all of your awesome comments.

Amazing place for a variety of services at a low cost! The staff and students are super professional and attentive to your comfort, health, etc. The waxing and facial service areas are clean and very nice. The facials are also amazingly relaxing and calming at a great price - I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Nice facilities and friendly staff. This is a learning environment, so be ready to spend a lot of time. It usually takes about 2 hrs for a wash/cut/blow dry for me, but the prices are great and you get to help someone learn and perfect their craft. I usually go in for simple trims and have never asked for anything too complicated and have had really positive experiences. Jest be ready to spend a few hours there!</Text>

<Text>Best place to go get your hair done by soon to be Paul Mitchell Professionals - supervised by the best cosmetology instructors available.  You will never find prices like this anywhere else.  PM is located in the heart of downtown just across the street from Cesar Chavez Park.  I have had my hair done there many times, dyed, styled, keratin treatments!  Try it - you will love it!<//Text>< UserId.>

<Text>I use to go to Paul Mitchell in Ohio religiously. I moved to California about 2 months ago and saw they were here too. Last week was my first visit and I got a hair cut and color. The cut was good almost similar to what I originally asked for.. I know she's still learning I was actually not upset because she did come close to what I wanted. I wanted the deep purple color and I liked the color but expected it to be bright and bolder. I gave it a few days and called back.. I don't think it was a fault issue, I think the color just didn't take as I expected. I was scheduled for this afternoon! I love the customer service and friendly students. I think that we must remind ourselves that although it's a salon. It's a school salon and these student are currently learning as they go therefore you may not get the highest paid salon service although for still being students they are very good at what they do.  Plus the price?! You would never get cut , color , shampoo and style for $64.00!! I will never overpay for any hair; lip and nail service. It helps the program, the students and myself!

<Review>I come from Palo alto to get cut and color here. The students are so professional and talented. The quality of my highlights has been incredible, and the price can't get beat. It may take a little longer because the students are trying to be as careful as possible, but it's worth it! It seems like a really friendly environment where students can ask for help from their teachers without being embarrassed.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I am a current Future Professional at this AMAZING school. The atmosphere is so positive, and our learning leaders are great. This school truly focusses on teaching us exactly what we need to learn to be successful in this industry. Even though it has only been a week into the school year, I can already tell this is going to be a fun-filled year to come with many discoveries to make. If you are looking for a beauty school that will help you get far in life, LOOK NO FARTHER this is the school to be at!<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x808fcca3949e9485:0xebfa2a7f09c25104</Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

I can't describe how excited and thrilled I am to be the first future professional here at Paul Mitchell the school San Jose. My experience here so far has been nothing but the best and I can't wait to see what this school has in store for us. The leaders, staff and other peers are so friendly and nice which makes my experience here better. I would definitely recommend anyone who has a passion for beauty to come to this school because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to come to this school. I'm excited to start working on the clinic floor on August 4!!</text>

Thank goodness for Paul Mitchell the school San Jose! I've went to numerous amount of tours and even had the chance to interview but none of them were as welcoming as Paul Mitchell the school San Jose. I was instantly greeted and hugged by my leaders and was given a step-to-step plan on what they offer. I was completely blown away. After doing all the research about what beauty school I wanted to attend. I must say, I made the right choice. I didn't understand why Paul Mitchell was such a big brand and after the first week of class, now I know! My beauty school experience has been surprisingly influential and dare-I-say-it, life-changing. I am so proud to be a part of this industry and having the most amazing leaders and peers to guide me through my journey.< /Text>

<text>All the services are performed by students under supervision. Students keep taking advice from supervisors frequently, which increases the service time. As students get graduated, you usually won’t get the service done by same person for every visits. Compared to other salons, this facility is clean. Their membership plans are worth it.<//text>< Pics>

A few of the staff are top notch, but the Paul Mitchell studio here in San Jose has lost their way.   Their iconic brand of style and class is far from what the students are performing and presenting themselves.  The goth/gutter look is more prevalent than anything there.<//review>

OH, and when you walk in, say to Vanessa.  She not only has my god daughter's name, but she has an incredible memory and bubbly personality to match -- she's a sweet heart and blew me away that after one visit remembered my name.  Yeah, what can I say, my ego is a sucker for being recognized -- I'm so vain --

BUT THAT'S WHY I GO TO PAUL MITCHELL!

< Review>
DO NOT GO TO THAT PLACE! Doesn't matter the money and convenience don't do it! They WILL mess up your hair while treating you like dirt.
I called for a hair cut and touch up color appointment (took me couple days before I got through because no one picks up the phone at that place) and asked for LEVEL 2 PROFESSIONAL. When I got there there was only LEVEL 1 available. But the girl at the desk sweared that everything will be fine, "they are not looneys" and implied that I'm being stupid for even assuming that something can go wrong. I told her explicitly that I don't care if the girl messes up my haircut but the color need to match (I have Auburn copper). She said "we got hair color professionals on the floor they will take care of it".
OK I'm going for it because I work full time and this is the one free evening I dedicated for this, and the next one comes in couple weeks. Comes out the girl "professional" with INCH LONG NAILS! Those types of nails that won't even allow you to open a water bottle. I should have walk away at this point... We go in, girl says basically nothing, on her phone texting while I'm just sitting there. Comes out her friend, one of the "professionals" - no difference from the rest. She asks if I want the color to match my roots! My ROOTS Carl!! For a touch up color! I'm trying to explain her, she basically ignores me. Both of them pull out some samples quickly matching BEHIND MY HEAD NOT EVEN SHOWING IT TO ME! And I know at this point you are probably asking - "girl why didn't you just intervene?" It was Monday, I've been sitting in the office for 10 hours and just wanted stuff to be done. But most importantly these "professionals" and so great and never at fault that the minute you are trying to say something they treat you like an idiot cuz they are just so much better than you...
The "professional" starts coloring and I kid you not it took her 2.5 hours (!) to do it without even drying!!! She would separate 2-3 hairs at a time and color them separately. And even that took her extra time because with those ridiculous nails she could barely hold the brush. I have NEVER seen anyone doing anything do slow. At some point I told her that I have to go and asked to blow dry it really quick as I had another appointment later. She did and here comes the best part - THEY PUT BRIGHT RED ON MY ROOTS!!! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?!! ARE YOU COLOR BLIND AND CAN'T DISTINGUISH COPPER FROM RED??!! Now I have a patch of bring red on top of my head and that looks awful. When I tried to bring it up to the manager she said it "looks fine and it's just the light". I didn't have time energy or moral power to complain further with these furias and guess what I still PAID FOR THIS ABOMINATION! They didn't offer to reschedule to fix it for free (no no only if I pay a second time for another terrible job). And in the end the manager kept blaming ME for giving the professional "not enough time - it can go up to 6 hours (!!!!!)" and overall made me feel terrible.
WORST DAY, WORST EXPERIENCE - NEVER COME CLOSE TO THAT PLACE!!< /Review>

Don't go with the membership plan. It's seriously a pain to book an appointment, they won't respond to your calls and emails. And they shut down without any prior notice to the customers, it happened twice with me.</Review>

Horrible..horrible, the students are sooo amateur when it comes to a haircut or color. I took the groupon for the basic color, haircut and blowdry. The only pro in the whole process was getting the appt. The receptionist was very prompt in calling back and accomodating me. And from there on, it was a downward trend. Even my greys weren't covered, the haircut was bare minimum done, she couldn't hold the scissors properly and the blowdry was so so. During the coloring process, the student mixed in some clear color and when the teacher pointed that out, she just tried to remove it with a towel and reapply the color. But nothing worked, neither the application nor the Paul Mitchell products.So basically the end result was that i paid the groupon just to get my hair blowdried which would have better and quicker at home. the whole thing took 3 hours. Not going back just because its cheap. Not worth my time or penny.
And if you observe closely, most of the people working there including the lead instructors, their hair looks so messed up and burnt.<//review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>How lovely was it to find a groupon for this wonderful school........but there are a few areas that they need to work on.
1.  Everyone there is very friendly and helpful.  If they have questions about what they are doing, they don't hesitate to ask another more experienced student or instructor.  That's a plus.
2.  What isn't a plus is the fact that I arrived at 10a.m. to find that my stylist had not shown for work/school and I never rec'd a call to reschedule.  And I didn't get home until 3:35p.m.
3.  Another plus, someone else was able to complete my needs.
4.  Not a plus, it took 5+ hours......YES 5+ hours to do highlights/trim/blowdry.   WHAT!!!!!!!!
5.  Not a plus, I had a $25 parking fee.
So to add this "wonderful" groupon up:
Groupon cut/highlight/style:                                 $25
Tip                                                                          30
parking                                                                   25
-------------
$80
Now it does seem that this fee isn't outrageous, and it's not if you look at the big picture, I do love my hair, she did a great job.  But for the time spent (which is absolutely ridiculous)  I could've had nails/pedicure and facial plus the hair stuff in all of that time.
So my overall review is everything was great except the time it took.  If these students would gear up on the time issue this place would be the "bizomb".  Therefore, I only can give 3 stars.  We all know how important time is nowadays.  I will call on them again, I would love to see if they have taken into consideration any of what I said.

If you want to do your haircut or color here, just don't.
it took the trainee 4 hours to do my haircut. for coloring after I was on time for my appointment, they told me the student is taking sick day... the funny thing is that they called me 2 hours before my appointment to confirm the appointment. I ended up paying for parking and waste my time and driving in rush hours. Never come back to this unorganized place.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>We had a wonderful experience with Angela Poncetta from Marcy Parmley Insurance Agency!  My family needed several signatures notarized on some documents.  Angela was prompt and professional. I particularly appreciated, however, how sweet and patient she was with my elderly parents.  I will always go to Angela for my notary needs from now on.  I highly recommend her.  You won't be disappointed.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

If you are getting your car serviced at Big O Tires, walk a cross the parking lot and stop in to see Ms.Parmley. She will give you a great price on some insurance. I did.</review>

I have been with Farmers Insurance, Marcy perm lease agency for years. We have our home, autos, motorcycle, and an umbrella policy. Megan pope assisted me most recently, as we needed to remove a vehicle. She was efficient and very professional, as are the entire staff. Not only is this agency well run but the staff are all professional, very friendly, and will help and fix any problems that you may encounter. I have had numerous contacts with Megan, and she is always willing to go above and beyond what is necessary to assist me. It is always a pleasure to talk to her. Thank you Ms.  Parmley for hiring such competent staff.<//text>

Great team! My wife and I decided to buy a new car on the same day that the Governor ordered the Stay in Place policy (I know I know) and we needed to switch insurance as well. I heard great things about Marcy and her team, so I reached out to Angela Poncetta. What a lucky decision! Due to the policy, we only corresponded via email, but she was SO quick, knowledgeable and nice! I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thanks again Marcy and team!<//review>

I just changed my insurance carrier to Farmers mainly because of price. But I've been very pleased with the amazing customer service I've received at this location by Angela. She turned around a quote within a day and followed up in a week. She then gave me a very easy to understand quote with a couple options. Then she made it extremely simple to change my insurance carrier.</text>

I was assisted by Angela Poncetta in setting up my renter's insurance. She provided excellent and friendly service and made the process super easy. Since then, whenever I have had questions, Angela has been there with answers and expertise. I highly recommend this agency, with superb professionals like Angela!<//Text>

I just changed my insurance carrier to Farmers mainly because of price. But I've been very pleased with the amazing customer service I've received at this location by Angela. She turned around a quote within a day and followed up in a week. She then gave me a very easy to understand quote with a couple options. Then she made it extremely simple to change my insurance carrier.< /Text>

I have been with the Marcy Parmley  Farmer's Ins. Agency for approx. 14 years.  I have always received excellent service especially from Angela.  She is a great help answering all my questions and checking on policy for me as well as recommending any additional coverage that I might need.  I recommend this Agency to anyone looking for Insurance needs!<//text>

As a new home owner, newly married, and working to establish my new business, Marcy was a breath of fresh air. She was very honest, up front, and always felt like her and her team had my best interest in mind. I do not recall every waiting longer than an hour for a response back from her and her team, which is rare these days. I highly recommend using her services or just giving her a call if you want the best information you can get.<//review>

So me and my wife are shopping around for new insurance. And after trying 3 other places! Geico, Allstate, and another farmers insurance here in town Angela Poncetta was by far the most helpful. I work long hours so I can’t be on the phone for 30 minutes and not get a quote. So she was able to do everything thru txt and a couple e-mails and bam. New car insurance better coverage and renters insurance! Can’t beat that. Give her a call super friendly!< /Text>

Marcy has been helping with my business and personal insurance for over a year now and I am impressed with her attention to what's best for me based upon the current market.  For instance, she found an option that actually reduced my overall payments by adding life insurance.  It's things like that, that show a personal is really looking out for their customer.<//Review>

We've used Zimmerman many different times and the work has been fine...middle of the road I would say.  This last time, though, was hard to even rate a 3.

The scheduling was poor, not sure when they would show even after they provided a date/time.  The work was completed after a couple of weeks and the last visit was an expected all day affair.

After completion, the mess left was unacceptable in my opinion.  I can see if all the lights replaced were left for us to dispose of would have been fine.  To leave only a couple vs. all was just confusing.  Same with boxes from the new lights...take them all or leave them all.  And a simple sweep up of the area would have been appreciated vs. leaving a pile.</text>

I recently upgraded my main service at my house from 125amps to 225amps with all new Square D hardware. Zimmerman (Dave and Ian) did a fantastic job with the install. I passed inspection with zero issues and everything works flawlessly. My house is now much safer with the new hardware (versus Zinsco panel from 1974) and my wife can charge her Tesla with REAL power vs. the standard plug. Again, great work and I would highly recommend!< /review>

Prompt and efficient service. Was hoping Andrew was assigned (per the email confirm and also a relative had work completed by him and were very pleased). Greg arrived promptly and assessed the situation in good time. He left advising that someone else in his office would forward a quote for his recommended work. Will update review once we receive quote. So far, so good.< /review>

When I couldn't track down my former electrician nor find an available one via recommendations from friends, I took shot and hired Zimmerman via finding them on Google. The experience could not have been better: a quick appointment to determine the scope of my job and a second appointment to perform  the necessary work. The electricians were great guys and professional. Zimmerman is now my family electricians and I am sharing their contact information with all of my friends in need of their services.</review>

I've been looking for an ethical, knowledgeable, and professional electrical service company for awhile now, and I think I finally found them!  They were contacted for an emergency service.  Not only were they able to come out promptly, they were able to advise on how to temporarily resolve the situation before they arrived, to mitigate the hazardous situation.  They were very clear in communicating when they could arrive.  They were also very upfront about ongoing obligations that could impact our appointment...all very reasonable.  They ended up being able to come earlier and clearly communicated that with me and asked for approval.  We not only got the issue resolved quickly but they were able to educate me and give me valuable insight into the issue for future knowledge.  As a female dealing with 2 male electricians, Dave and Ian, I never felt talked down to or as though my questions were annoying.  This alone is a major sticking point for me so kudos to Dave and Ian!  I don't know if I want to recommend them simply because I'm going to need them in the very near future!!  And as demonstrated by the continuous high reviews, they're going to be in demand!  If you do work with them, it seems you will be very pleased!  I know I am!!!</review>

As a property manager for the last 12 years I come across a lot of electricians and contractors.  I have nothing but high praise for Zimmerman.  For me, communication is key, and I am always able to reach them either by phone or email, and they are always very quick to help explain any job that I have questions on.  In working with homeowners associations we often need quick, efficient and cost effective repairs and Zimmerman has never let me down.  I highly recommend Zimmerman for anybody needing any electrical work.</text>

Zimmerman Electric has become my "go to" electrician in the South Bay.  They respond quickly via phone and when they commit to being at the house they are always on time within their arrival window.  Ed has worked on multiple issues at my house, and he is easy to work with and does high quality work.</text>

Greg was fantastic!  Knew exactly what to do and was fast.  They was also the most cost effective.  You have to call this company if you have an electrical work.</Review>

I have used Zimmerman for close to 15 years.  They are very responsive to both emergency situations and regular improvement type calls.  I have trusted them for both our HOA business and my personal business.  I would not use another electrician in the South Bay.  Very satisfied.</text>

Great place for a burger - that is all we tried. One burger and one Primo burger with a side of fries. The service was great, family type of greeting, the food is not fast food. Like others have mentioned, worth the wait.

The hamburger was nothing like a chain burger, it had the smell of fresh cook and it was on a fresh bun with all the right condiments for an American Burger!  Bravo and thank you for the lunch.</review>

<text>Bad experience from Primo Burgers with a waiting time between ordering and being served of more than 20 minutes (at the drive-thru). The clerk taking the order was not able to me what's in the veggie melt, well forget about the veggie (a tiny bit of avocado and a slice of tomato), it's full of bacon and ham. The cheese burger was good though. But the Greek salad was just plain bottom of the run tasteless iceberg lettuce.
I don't recommend this place if you're thinking of a quick meal, and even less for a tasty one.<//text>< pics>

The food wasn't too bad, but they were out of a few different things. The teriyaki chicken sandwich was pretty good. Their drive thru was down too, so they had someone coming out to the cars and writting down the orders. The employees were friendly and hard working.</Review>

<review>First restaurant I ate at when I moved to California breakfast lunch and dinner for three days straight and ordered something different every meal and was astonished at How every meal I ordered was fantastic and the price remarkable definitely five star you got to go try it restaurant and they don't just give you little portions either every meal had leftovers to snack on later if I could find something negative to say it would have to be there's not enough of them around. Perfect for that Friday night family night meal. customer service and friendliness five out of five stars restaurant was spotless. I give perfect rating you must try the malts<//review><pics>None<//pics><Time>1603950141540</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>We decided to give it a try again,at 1 point this was the pitstop on our travels. Very oily pastrami,&breakfast was iffy, meat is questionable,*Its just not what it use to be*. Building is starting to look rundown😐 restroom DON'T Use it;its a wreck, even if you got to go don't do it! & yes unfortunately we were disappointed with the food & had to stop eating. This place use to have ridiculously good food-what happened?< /text><userid>103714700375929146805< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<name>Geoff Walsh< /name><Review>I stopped in here while driving through Mojave on the recommendation of friends, and certainly glad I listened to them. They have an extensive menu, and from what I saw being served, and the comments as people left, everything is pretty much tasty and delicious. I ordered the chili cheeseburger and a vanilla milkshake and both were wonderful! Highly recommended< /Review>< UserId.>

I'm glad they are slow and that's because its fresh and good. But after I certain time you cant call your order in advance so you wont have to wait in the drive thru forever. More pros then cons just a inconvenience when time doesnt wait on us< /review>

Burger came with shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion, and dill pickle slices on an oversized sesame bun. So big, couldn't finish it all.
The fries, oh the fries! Clearly the star of the show! Large steak fries. Perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. Seasoned, but a little salty.
The combo (bacon cheeseburger, fries, drink) was less than $6!!!
Make a stop here just for the fries. Ignore the shabby appearance and weedy parking lot.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP63it_4CFL4QiaXzKoCXyvFLyFCDNbaUjCM5Dh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY3HpVWhIvsTsuJb17r6Gt_V8-yAWSgrmIP3K9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

I ordered the chicken salad and there was so much water in it it was like soup once I put on the salad dressing. The tiny piece of avocado was dark brown and there was one big chunk of tomato in it. And to top it all off, I had to eat in the car because of Covid. I ended up throwing it away.</Review>

On a good note; the girl that took our order was very pleasant, and the fries were really good.

Now the rest; we ordered 3 meals.  Country fried steak with sunnyside up eggs, spicey chicken sandwich meal and a double cheeseburger meal.

Country fried steak was so overcooked it couldnt be cut into, leather like.  The breading was burnt.
Spicey chicken sandwich was also burnt tasting and hard to chew.
The double cheeseburger was cold, completely dried out and tasted like charcoal.  The cheese must've been an afterthought because it wasn't even melted.

We gave our remaining food to our dog, even she turned up her nose.

We waited for OVER an hour for this meal.
It's really hard to support locally (especially in Mojave) with this kind of lack of service and pride.
Sadly, we should've just went to McDonald's.

Guess it's worth it to drive for good food.<//Review>

I used to go to primos all the time growing up since I live in mojave. It used to have the place to go for quality and quantity but their service and quality has gone down the drain. I ordered a carne asada burrito today and they gave me mostly fat and gristle and rice and slapped a slice of American cheese on top. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I don’t see myself returning unless I see an improvement in quality<//Review>

I've eaten here at least five times. When I'm in the area I love eating here. The food is cooked when you order it. This place makes everything delicious, but my favorite are the fried zucchini and onion rings! Oh and the milkshakes are so thick and delicious you need a spoon!<//text>

The zucchini,  onion rings,  and the burger were just ok, taste and quality wise.  Prices were fair, but aren't aligned with the marginal quality.

The food quality used to be better.  Not sure what has changed?< /text>

<text>The good part is our food was quite good. The burger patties are a bit thin next time I will order double patties. The bad news is we stopped in when there was a Boy Scout Troop inside and the kitchen was quite backed up. It took about a half hour to get our food. The french fries are seasoned and delicious and I enjoyed the onion rings also. I only gave three stars but I will stop being again and give it another try.<//text>< pictures>

Ordered a breakfast burrito, the hash browns were undercooked and the bacon was a very low quality, great size for the cost.</text>

I have a split review on this primos . They have bomb pastrami sandwiches and pastrami chili cheese fries. But there wet burrito was horrible . Usually on a wet burrito there is a wet red sauce like enchilada sauce that goes on top of the burrito. In this case at primos they're wet burrito is covered with a vinegary garlic chilli sauce. The asada tasted rotten like it was from the day before. I even ordered a taco salad and had the asada on top of it and it still tasted bad.<//Text>

This is such an interesting area.  We enjoy eating  on the patio and trying the wines.  Interesting menu, well priced.  Have been there multiple times: brunch, lunch, and dinner, and have never been disappointed .  Convenient free garage across the street.  Friendly staff.</review>

I've been coming to Bar Via since it opened and am constantly impressed. The location is great and it provides a well needed change in vibe and atmosphere from the surrounding ballpark bars and restaurants. The drink and food menus get updated on a regular basis and always have some good selections - nice happy hour options too. If you make it up to the rooftop then the views are amazing but both bars will treat you well. The personal touch really puts them over the top, Anthony and team make everyone feel at ease and comfortable every time.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I waited forever for my food in the middle of a 5hr drive to Mammoth Lakes! I usually go out of my way to support the local economy and try something unique and different. What a mistake this time!  I heard from a local who was waiting too that the owner Barbie inherited it and doesn’t put any money back in the business.

Don’t ever expect employees to care MORE than the owner does.
OWNERS need to OWN their business!

This place is in need of A LOT of TLC!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3A3Nzvj8mM-53Hz8H2lAgkKdOEC8FEIhZycar=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsrMvR2kkQVSBT3VxVuwfkK7akJwtfNvdD-2ZR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

This place I love! A bunch of different burgers and the Zucchini fries are a must. Also, where else can you get a malted these days. The staff is super friendly and they even bring your food to your table which is pretty rare anymore. All around super place to eat.< /text>

<Text>Haven't visited in quite a while but pretty much it's the same as I remember....chili may have changed a bit but chili cheese fries are still good. Came for the fried zucchini and ended up with a salad, chili cheese fries, burger and zucchini. Same friendly service too. A lot has changed in Mojave so I'm glad Primo Burgers has held on.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><userid>113146306820363270847<//userid><Rating>4<//Rating>< name>

<Name>Natalie Marie<//Name><Review>It's pretty sad when you go out and spend a little $ expecting to enjoy a nice and quite breakfast, only to get the opposite. Don't get me wrong, the price and portions of their menu is great, but their staff is just plain rude! It was sad to see a family with 4 little kid actually being more quite and well mannered then their staff. Even though the price is good, I'd rather spend a little extra for some peace and quite.<//Review><Rating>3< /Rating></record>

I asked for eggs with crispy bacon and got a nice large serving barely cooked bacon. I asked for a burger on a bun with no sesame seeds, but they got that wrong too. Sent it back but it took a while to  fix and it was not busy at all.< /review>

My wife ordered us the creme brûlée blend as it really peaked our interest.

It was really good and tasty! Not to sweet but very nice while strolling in the park!

Cmon in and enjoy...by the way the staff is wonderful and will assist you with a great choice of beverage.</text><GmapID>0x80c224593606ff93:0x36c036a6a0952fc8<//GmapID><username>Lori Dunlap</username><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Burgers and fries are outstanding. They take a little longer than a typical fast food restaurant but totally worth the wait. Here's a tip: share the fries because you probably can't finish an order by yourself.< /review>

Terrible, fries were cold a unsalted, the BLT was the driest sandwich I've ever had and the Pepsi was extremely flat. Bar none the worst meal I've ever encountered from you store, and I've eaten there at least twice a week. Sad....<//review>

<Text>I really like this place if I'm craving something fried. There is a wait...I've sat in my car close to 45min before. I am a little bummed since I love their fried mushrooms, but this last time, for about $6, I really didn't get much. I counted 10 small caps and a random fried onion. Normally it's worth the price and unfortunately I was not impressed with this last visit...<//Text><time>1574212548639< /time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great ambiance in the patio area with slatted wood covering and lit fireplace. The wine selection was pretty darn good and I was pleased to see many from the central coast. Huevos Rancheros plate was Tex-mex in taste unfortunately. There was water or soupy stuff on the plate. I'd go back here but try something else. Not bad but not outstanding.<//Review>

The service was very slow. I ordered a burger and chili cheese fries and I had to go up to the window 3 different times to remind them about the fries. The burger patty was ultra thin and very greasy. The chili fries were soggy. 2 stars because the lady at the register was super friendly.< /Text>

This is a throwback hamburger shack from the 60's. The flavor, menu and quantity match those memories. When the shake machine is working, I like the root beer shake. Primarily run by women ever since I first stopped here on the way to Mammoth, I excuse the condition of the men's restroom but I haven't been in many that were worse.<//text>

Very good food, its on the traveled route through town, good menu, not just a hamburger restaurant, they have a breakfast menu as well, along with Frappuccinos and other coffee specialties. I got one of the house burgers specials and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everyone was friendly, I highly recommend this restaurant.<//text>

Burger was ok. Would have committed murder to actually get my drink. I nearly died of thirst. I finally got my drink as I was walking out. Not the shakes I ordered, and no cup holders to take it with me, so I left it with them on the counter.

So very frustrating. That burger was not worth the $10 I paid to not get my shake.< /Review>

I know they make the food fresh but they need more help in the morning time or something. Their really slow. Morning is the most popular time for customers to stop and grab food...Maybe more than one cook, prep food etc..But over all, the food is Delicious< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Gotta love Primo’s. They make their food from scratch so it might take a while but it’s worth the wait. I love the women who work the drive thru window, they are so sweet and always call you “honey” or “sweetie” it just feels like you’re at your family’s house and a loving woman is cooking you a meal. It feels like grandma’s hug.

Primo’s is like a mom and pop drive thru oases in the Mojave desert littered with big corporation fast food spots without that homemade touch. Try their Frisco burger with no tomato and add mushrooms, trust me. Their fried chicken is really good too. Steak and egg breakfast really hit the spot too. Yummy I’m getting hungry just thinking about it!

Wish I had pics but I always eat my food way too fast 🙈🤷🏽‍♀️</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am extremely bothered confuse and still really hungry.
I've ordered food from the primo burger location in Mojave.
I'm a butcher at a high-end location and also a professional celebrity chef.

(Chili cheese fries) I ask for fresh fries which they were not.
I eat into the chili and realize it's has no flavor. I said to myself I'll just add salt and pepper .
I did not know it's will take the bottle just to get a taste out of it.
I asked for my money back and they told me no refund, yes I did eat in the location , I was told it will come out of her check if she was to return it which is illegal.
she did ask if I want anything else but I was so disappointed at this point I put the chili cheese fries in the trash and walked out that's was $7.00 .
I was still so hungry so I asked if I can just get a steak, the manager said okay but if it's something wrong with this don't bother coming back.
This location don't have Cooks everything is pre-order.
I did take the steak and it was okay it was no bigger than my hand.
If I was not in a hotel i would have cook  for my self unfortunately im on a traveling team.
Pre warning don't order the chili cheese fries it's all (chili and water) pre-order.
The cashier was also really nice and helpful I thought she was cute and she made me smile her customer service made me forget that I was hungry.
I still did not eat the steak I was scared that they did something to it I see it in my line of work all the time .</Review>

<Text>King of greasy spoons!  Small place, with sometimes desparately slow service and the eel of a greasy spoon.  However, clean dining area decorated with vintage film photos and an expansive menu  with items you would not expect in a flea trap like Mojave.</Text>< resp>

Restaurant is not in it's best shape.  Restaurant could use a make over, but the hamburger and french fries I ordered were nothing to complain about.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.< /review>

<Text>The food here was okay, but the entire restaurant looks broken down. Having been here before I expected more from the food, but it was half decent at best, sloppily made, and didn’t have the same feel from before. The salad that one of my family members ordered was terrible. All around I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone unless you are really hungry as the next hour or so has no restaurants.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Best "burger joint" in town!
Tasty food, interesting menu, but no healthy food offerings...very upscale...a little pricey.
Go there with co-workers, very popular... but I can't eat here anymore. I eat food that's good for me, they eat food that tastes good...so no processed or fried foods....all they got for me is a $6.00 salad or $4.00 oatmeal....no thanks!
I changed to eating healthy, but with no Vegetarian food options, kinda pissed me off... can't order out anything here anymore
Hope Primo adds Whole Food / Vegan options to the menu!</Review>

This was my fourth or five time eating there over the last 7 years.  The food was allways good but the service was allways the worst of any place I ate, which is why it was never my first choice.  This time not so!  Food was brought out in a reasonable time and service was good.  Hopefully the service continues this way and if so I will be eating there more often.</review>

They got it right here milkshake definitely killer and for a fast food place to be able to put an over easy egg onto a burger, definitely Primo stop here if you’re passing through. Great little burger joint.< /review>

<Text>Food is really good especially for the price. The Breakfast menu is a must, and the Burgers are big and juicy.
The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 is because I ordered the steak dinner and it was horrible, but I chok that up as my fault because what really was I expecting for $8.99 at a burger joint in the middle of the dessert!</Text>< pics>

I’ve been going to Primo Burger for about 20+ years probably and they have never let me down they have Been very consistent  from their burritos To their hamburgers it’s basically a colossal burger which is the bomb to me if I had the money I would eat there all the time<//Review>

I've eaten at a few different primo burgers, and let me just say this one was the worst. The meat was chewy not edible at all,  The fries were soft and undercut, the the avocado they put in my food was brown! I just ate there about 2 hours ago and I'm writing this review from the comfort of my toilet 🤮. The food was horrible and that sucks because they are the only primo burger for miles. I will never eat there again, I fell so sick right now. The lady at the front was nice. I dont know how they have so many good reviews. The food was old very old, it take a long time for meat to become ruber. To feed people old food that has been sitting out for a long time is just wrong ( I'm talking to you cook) why would you do that $24 for food poisoning and I mean I'm very sick sitting next to my toilet on the floor. Your irresponsible and don't deserve to work inside of the kitchen!! Shame on you. You need to quite or get fired, integrity, morals, self respect, or maybe respect for others. I kinda hate you right now this is very personal for me, because I can eat almost anything and not get sick but you did it. Your a disappointment cook.<//review>

The Frisco burger was very good, although the fried mushrooms left much to be desired. Seriously, the Frisco burger was absolutely fantastic, which is the only real saving grace, given how terrible the fried mushrooms were... Soggy, oil-soaked, greasy and the breading had no crisp to it whatsoever. However they do provide a /lot/ of them, so there's that.

Avoid the sides, get the burgers.<//Text>

This is a gem in the dessert, the food is good not to mention very reasonable. Staff is courtesy and helpful. Place aways seems clean, bathrooms could use work, but just a great Mom & Pop burger place. We always stop when going through Mohave.<//Text>

If you want a burger I'd recommend this place because their burgers are juicy and nicely seasoned, their fries are perfectly fried and nicely seasoned.</Review>

I had a breakfast croissant sandwich, different and a good choice. My husband had the bacon and ham breakfast sandwich quite good. Latte was like just warm milk and Americano was mlm like burnt water, try a different beverage.< /review>

Very very good pastrami and philly cheese steak sandwiches. If you’re going for your lunch break make sure to call in 20 minutes or so ahead of time.< /Review>

I've gone in there a handful of times and each time it was forgettable. Every one of the burgers I have eaten from there was bland and tasteless. Thank God for other burger joints in town. About the only thing that interests me is the fried combo platter with mushrooms, zucchini, and onion rings. They give you a lot which matches the price for it. The staff did not make me feel very welcomed the times I went. It's a good place to wait for the bus, get out of the cold for a while, and get some fries or a drink as it's the closest eatery to the bus stop while waiting for what is most of the time, a long overdue bus.< /Review>

<text>I had the Beef dip (a French dip). I normally don't order beef, but I was hungry! It was huge and delicious​. Bowl of au jus was tasty also. This is not a restaurant, rather order up front and they bring it to you. It was so good we returned for breakfast. Prices are great and establishment well kept. Very old diner look. Very friendly staff.</text>< pics>

Good restaurant with a lot of helpful employees. There is one employee who consistently ruins my experience, however. She is a small african american girl, and she is always rude and often picks her nose around the food. As a minority myself with many african american relatives, this is in no way race related. I just do not want to have to worry about unsanitary food or deal with bad customer service any more. I have been coming here for a long time, but I do not go as often anymore because of this.</Text>

I LOVE Primos! Everything is fresh and truly delish. I was worried I couldnt eat here anymore, since becoming vegetarian but their Veggie melt and Garden burger are also amazing! The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because it does take a while to get your food. I dont suggest ordering if your in a hurry but the food is worth the wait.</Review>

They are slow as carp. Used to be I didn't mind waiting cause the food was SOOO good. Well I won't be waiting no more. The staff is clearly overworked. It took 15 mi it's a in drive thru. That's not include g the 5 mi it's a I sat waiting to order. I ordered sat there a while longer waiting for any indication she even heard me, than just pulled up already knowing .....YEP AIN'T COMING HERE EVER AGAIN.< /Review>

<review>Worst experience on chicken burrito. First don't put on your menu mexican food when is not the quality of it. I am full mexican and we do not do are food like that. We do everything fresh the chicken looked like deli flat chicken for sandwiches rather than really cook chicken breast, bean were smash beans mix in with rice like from a can. Your suppose to put full bean with fresh rice and onion with cilantro which your burrito don't have. I asked for some hot salsa for my burrito and you give me pico de gallo which is just tomatoes hide you need red and green salsa. I could go on in what else you guys missed in putting, but as a restaurant your suppose to know what your serving.  And how it's actually cooked please don't put food you don't know how to make i am not complaining about staff just food quality😑<//review>< pics>

But now for about two almost three months the slushie machine has been broken and apparently the owner has not fixed the machine or doesn't want to. It really sucks cause not only are they losing money but I will not be getting food there without a slushie I rather go to tehachapi or lancaster especially in this heat all I want is something cold. Now the reason I give then 2 stars is because the owner obviously doesn't care for his business.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>
