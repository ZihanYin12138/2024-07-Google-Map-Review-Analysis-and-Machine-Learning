Real simple order you would think. Asked for small order boneless dry lemon pepper.  Needless to say I got a small order of wet boneless.
Not even an apology!!! Poor customer service!!!

I found this spot near my house and decided to try it as I love Wings and always need to try them at different places.  This place did not disappoint.  I also loved the fries with chicken and buffalo sauce.  I would definitely recommend for Chicken Wing Fans!<//Review>

I would not go there again! All it is is popcorn chicken on top of fries! I got parmesan cheese and garlic  chicken but had no flavor! They give you no sauce to dip them in! They charge extra,  can you believe that! Fries cost 11.00 no sauce!!!!< /Review>

I ordered the chips with queso  and didn't know they were missing till I got home. I called back and the young lady that answered said I'd forgotten the bag. I was handed only 1 bag by them and they have lost a customer. I think customer service is as important as the food.<//Review>< Time>

<Text>We arrived at the time promised for our online order, yet the food was not ready for another 18 minutes. It was mid week, before noon, which typically is not a busy time. There was inappropriate music blasting in the restaurant that actually made me feel uncomfortable as I stood there waiting. I wonder if music with inappropriate lyrics is allowed by the owner/manager or if that’s something the young people working chose for the atmosphere?<//Text>< Resp>

I’ll admit... intriguing at first or even attempting, so definitely go for it. It is a great place to go for your cheat day. They serve lots and the sauce on it is great.< /review>

<Review>3 of us walk in together and I order first. Next two guys got their food and finished it before I got mine. Went inside to check and not sure if they forgot it or what but almost 30min from time of order until I posted this and still haven't received food.

Don’t get me wrong the food is amazinggggggg BUT even if you call or order ahead the food takes another 15minutes (even if you got there late to ensure you can just pick it up) honestly can say best wings in chino hills though so if you can get past the wait then go for it !</review>

Arne and his crew are professional, but also able to explain things in terms that people like me, non-mechanics, can understand. He told me about how the job could be done for $50 less, with the cheaper (from China parts) and that $50 can upgrade everything to best brand name. Open and honest, customer service oriented and extremely fair! I will continue to make the drive from Temecula for Arne to work on my Jeep anytime.</text>

Have been going to A&D for 6+ years - Arne and the entire team at A&D are exceptional people and mechanics. They are kind, talented, and always (always!) treat us fairly for what work should be done (compared to others in the industry who often suggest unnecessary work at unnecessary prices). Having a German car always made it challenging for me to find the right mechanic. A&D takes care of our Jetta and Lexus with outstanding skill and attention. They also have after-hours drop-off and pick-up, which is extremely helpful for my family's busy schedule. Highly recommend A&D!</Text>

I absolutely recommend coming here for your repairs! I drive a Jeep Rubicon JKU and like most jeep people I have enjoyed the perks of a great warranty and oil changes and services through the dealership… or so I thought. I've been waiting to get some much needed work done through the dealership and not able to get it done in a timely manor, not only was A&D able to find some missed issues like a choked out air filter and some electrical lines being rubbed bare but they were able to fix the broken parts I really needed done. 100% recommend coming here for all your fixing needs.
While I was waiting for my jeep to be fixed, there were 3 walk-ins and they were all helped right away and all repete custimers. Clearly they all liked the service here too. Thank you so much A&D!!!< /Review>

This is the best auto service place that I have ever utilized in my life. They are super friendly, open, totally honest and competent along the lines of a NASA launch facility. They tell you exactly what is wrong with your vehicle, what needs to be done and what is superfluous or not required. They also tell you clearly when nothing needs to be done.<//Review>

My passenger side mirror was damaged and need to be replaced. I called Arnie and he ordered the part and fixed my mirror very quickly. It was a honest and easy transaction at a fair price. I will definitely be back if I have any other car repairs.<//text>

I’ve now had brake jobs done on both of our cars here (‘07 Saab 9-3 & ‘04 Toyota Highlander) & I am very satisfied! Arne is a very friendly, professional, no-nonsense guy with loads of experience. He takes the time to show you your car’s issue & what he recommends should be repaired. Great prices & great service makes for a great auto shop!< /Text>

I've lived in San Diego a little over 4 years now and it took me longer than I would've liked to find a regular shop that I can trust, but I can say with full confidence that A&D is THAT shop. Arnie and Dave are true gentleman, a fact I cannot emphasize enough!!!</text>

<date>1572915695679< /date><Review>Arnie has taken great care of us on multiple occasions... He even saved me from a $5k repair bill from the stealership which is ultimately why I started frequenting his shop. Their careful examination of my stealership estimate led to just a $600 repair while pointing out the fact Mossy Nissan was trying to get me to replace new parts with new parts... Honest repair and maintenance facility that deserves your business... Expect to make an appointment as they're always busy.</Review>< user_name>

I've brought my Golf here a few times and have always been happy. Arne is absolutely awesome - friendly, honest, and usually talks me OUT of doing any unnecessary work on the car. I even got charged nothing once for bringing my car in for a quick check. As long as I live in San Diego, these guys will always get my business.<//review>

A friend recommended them to me saying they provided the best car repair experience he’d ever had. I thought my friend was exaggerating, but, if anything, he undersold A&D! They’re prompt, professional, and friendly. They give you real advice on what could or should be done and make a sincere effort to charge a price that’s reasonable. If you’re ever choosing between them and a dealer, I guarantee you won’t regret choosing A&D!< /review>

Great garage that tells you which repairs are worth it, and which ones are not.  Very trustworthy. Very friendly with great customer service.  These guys clearly care about getting repeat business.  I with I had found them 10 years ago.</Review>

<Review>Arne and David -- cannot say thank you enough. After recently moving here from the East coast and not knowing anyone it was hard to find a car shop you can trust. Luckily for me I found a great one. They were nothing less than excellent with their service and communication throughout the entire repair process. Completely fair and reasonable pricing opposed to the dealer, and they even got the repair done for me in a few hours. Nothing but honesty and genuine respect from these guys.

I appreciate all your help putting up with my many phone calls and silly questions, throughout this process.</Review>< Pics>

The team at A & D are fantastic.  My partner took his Ford Focus (one with all the transmission issues) in and got a motor mount/shaking issue resolved for ~$360, with some other minor services, that the dealership quoted $700.

A week or two afterwards, he noticed his engine overheating and saw that the hose connecting the coolant container to the radiator had a hole worn in it because it was out of its clip and rubbing against an engine belt.  When we took it back to get it taken care of, we mentioned that it could have been a simple mistake of them not putting the hose back after the previous service, since that was the last time anyone was under the hood.

These guys seriously stepped up and replaced the hose without charge.  We understood it was probably an innocent mistake, but we can't say how much we respect them for taking responsibility and treating us as they did.

As long as they have the same integrity and high quality of care, we will be customers.  Can't recommend them enough.< /text>

I had them take a look at my Ford explore front upper control arms. They replace them both in less than four hours. very reasonable prices. And good communication.  friendly staff.

Had another visit for a different issue and got the same great service at a very reasonable price keep up the good work!<//text>

We brought in a 2002 Subaru WRX to get the clutch replaced. They were the lowest quote of the places we asked for estimates and were easy to work with the entire time. They worked with us for the drop off time since we were both working and got the car done in one day.

They communicated the whole way through the process and were a breath of fresh air after having dealt with some shady repair businesses in the past.

You should definitely come here if you need any work done on your vehicle. I know they are going to be our go-to place from here on out.</text>< pics>

<Text>I took my 2001 Volvo in here to get some service done.  Very disappointed in this because after I got my Volvo back, it made loud grinding/rubbing noises that it never made before. Had they test driven the car and made any left turn, they would have heard it. I live almost an hour away so I don't have a lot of spare time to bring it back down.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dbffeb0cb81e49:0xa23825d074059e8d</GmapID></record>

They repaired the radiator of my volvo at a low price.
They are very reliable and honest, experienced, professional,transparent, and detail- oriented.
I strongly recommend A & D auto.</Review>

Arne is a true "rock star" and gentleman in the auto repair business! after receiving a grim and very expensive quote for an oil leak on my Volvo I decided to seek another opinion! after looking at favorable reviews I went to A&D Autowerks, best choice ever! The required fix was not even the part suggested by the dealer and the repair was no less than $2000 less! Cant thank these guys enough! Great experience.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>My Husband is stationed here in San Diego and I just recently moved here. So I was nervous with whoever I took my car too not knowing the area at all. I'm so glad I found this place. I was recommended to them by a local dealership.

Arne and David are the sweetest guys. I just got my Mitsubishi Eclipse back from them today.
Another mechanic had worked on it for me for two weeks and gave up, telling me I just needed to sell it. It wouldn't start and this guy had no clue what they problem was. I was devastated since my Eclipse is the only transportation I have here and getting to the Naval Base without it is stressful.

So instead I towed it to A & D Autowerks and they were able to diagnose what the problem was as soon as my car arrived. It was $175 to fix what was wrong causing it not to start. I also needed a new battery from it sitting so long at the other place not being started. Arne even offered to go pick up the type of battery I needed same day from a place within the area so I wouldn't have to wait for one to be delivered. Nicest gesture ever.

I can't tell you how relived I was. I got calls from both Arne and David updating me every step of the way with the status of my car. When it arrived, the diagnosis, price range, when they test drove it and when it was ready to come pick up. I'm so thankful. They were so polite and I was extremely comfortable with them.

Thank you so much guys for making my day! And this being such an easy process.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Date>1442284665808</Date><UserId.>104530329194617663479< /UserId.><username>Andrea< /username></record>

Arne and his team are a breath of fresh air: honest, patient, trustworthy, reliable, competitive prices, very experienced and expert mechanics. (everything you can wish for they are A++ all the way in communication, service and quality of work)

My wife and I were so tired of getting the run around from the local car dealer so we gave A and D Autowerks a try.(we were at the point where we were going to just trade in a young car!)  This is customer service that you will rarely find.  Our car now drives as good as new, like it should. Their motto is to treat customers like family and they really do- every step of the way. You don't feel like a number and his team is all clued up on every car in the shop. I spoke directly with Arne through the entire process. Arne personally returned every call within minutes (usually he answered the phone!) and explained everything to me. What a pleasure to do business with. A++ all the way. Absolutely amazing experience.

Update:
My wife's Volvo windshield was leaking and ended up needing to remove, dry and replace the carpet. The local Volvo dealer quoted us $900 for 6.5 hrs of work.

Went back to Arne and Dave, they took care of it for $300 with a smile and great follow up. Said took them just over 3 hours!

Never had to once check in with them. They were always on top of it.

These guys are the go to place for any Volvo auto service and repair. I didn't think they would be interested or would want to handle this but they handle everything and do it well and with excellent customer service-don't go anywhere else.<//text>

Dr. Besh had such high ratings that I traveled a distance to see him for my hand.  The staff seems nice enough.  I was told I first had to have x-rays before I would see him.  His assistant was very friendly and took more information from me.  The x-rays were on the computer with only a couple of the slides showing.
I was told Dr. Besh would be coming in without a mask though the mask mandate was still in place.  They enforce it in the office and building, but he would not wear one when seeing patients.
When Dr. Besh came into the office, his demeanor was very aloof.  He introduced himself and sat down.  He asked what problem I was having, and he touched a painful point and diagnosed me with trigger thumb.  He explained briefly what it was.  I asked about another point on my other hand and was told it was arthritis.  He never looked at the x-rays in my presence or discussed them with me.  What was the point of taking x-rays if all he had to do was examine my hand?
He said I should start with doing paraffin wax treatments along with physical therapy, ice packs and nsaids for 6 weeks before coming back to see him in 4 weeks.
I didn't want to travel that far to use their physical therapists, so his assistant was nice enough to find the name of one closer to me.  She then walked me over to the physical therapy area to get a paraffin wax machine.  I was told insurance doesn't cover it, and I have to pay $40 for it.  I later looked online, and I see the exact model for $24.99 at most places.  I felt ripped off.
After reflection, I've decided I will see another hand surgeon to follow up with.  I can't see working with such a cold and disengaged doctor especially if I have to see him more than once.  He may be good at what he does, but he appears to lack care for his patients.<//text>

<review>Might be a good and knowledgeable doctor, but extremely unprofessional and stuck up.
Have not seen a doctor more rude. was at his office twice and both times had to wait in the room for almost an hour for doctor to show up. When Dr. Besh actually showed up, and instead of apologizing for a delay started complaining that I only went to therapy once in over 1 month, when it was his office that could not get me referral to therapy. Once I mentioned a problem with his office scheduling and that it is not professional to be late for appointments scheduled, got an attitude from a.doctor that called his assistant without apologizing stated that patient is not happy with this office and send him to another doctor, got up and walked out of the room.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Absolutely worst experience ever with a doctor! My 15-year-old daughter was having wrist pain(only).  Our first appointment, he asked us many questions and did a one-minute exam on her wrist and concluded that she had an auto immune disease and needed to see an auto immune doctor. He told her that she has rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 15 with only wrist pain and no other symptoms.  I made an appointment with the auto immune doctor, but it was 3 months out.  My daughter was having anxiety over this diagnosis, so I asked her pediatrician for advice. The pediatrician immediately ran a full blood panel INCLUDING ALL auto immune and rheumatoid markers.  My daughter had a thorough exam as well and the pediatrician said that there is no reason to believe that she has an auto immune disease with perfect bloodwork, perfect exam and only wrist pain.
We went back to our 6 weeks follow up appointment with Dr. Besh and I explained to him the homework that we have done on her health while we waited for auto immune specialist appointment.  He was OUTRAGED that we saw her female pediatrician and looked for some answers.  He said to my daughter, you have an auto immune disease and by your mom not taking you to the auto immune doctor, your disease will not go away.  Broadway (she is a performer) doesn’t care that you have a disease.  My daughter started to cry.  Dr. Besh then says, why are you crying?  She says, because I am scared to have an auto immune disease.  Dr. Besh says, crying won’t make it go away.  You mother needs to take you to an auto immune doctor. He then says, as he slams the folder on the desk…I cannot help you until you see the auto immune doctor and I would be happy to sign your file to another doctor.  While all of this was happening 3 nurses came in the calm/observe his behavior. The staff and nurses are nice, and I could tell that they were appalled at his behavior…at this point, we were both in tears.  I could not believe the way we were being treated.  Especially a child.  It was a horrible, ugly, disrespectful experience that my daughter will never forget.
We went to another wrist specialist who didn’t believe that it was an auto immune disease.  He sent us to a neurologist who did a complete nerve and tendon test and confirmed that she had Carpal Tunnel syndrome. She recommends vitamin B6 300mg a day, wrist braces, rest and to set up an ergonomic distance learning desk.  With 3 weeks, (after months of pain and many tests, doctor visits) she was feeling much better.
In closing, Dr. Besh treated me and my 15-year-old daughter in the worst manner possible.  He did not care for her wellness, pain and refused to listen to her.  He was cruel and mean to a child and disrespectful to me who was trying to advocate for my daughter.  That is not acceptable behavior for anyone let alone a doctor!! I feel like he let his ego get in the way of doing what’s best for my daughter.  We never received an apology.</Text>< username>

This is by far the worst doctor’s office. The should fire Marisa the front desk patient coordinator. She lied about my appoitment and didn’t even check my insurance. How are they finding those unprofessional staff? Poor communication. She doesn’t know how to check benefits 😄😄😄😄 wow, dong trust them with your time and don’t go to dr besh not an good doctor< /Review>

I have been going to this clinic for several years as an interpreter; and let me just say that each time I've seen the staff conduct itself very professional, courteous, and friendly. They greet the patients by name - I think that adds a very nice personal touch, which creates an overall pleasant experience.
Finally, Dr. Besh's care towards his patients are straight forward, with a hint of that family love.
Everyone is treated like they belong there.</Text>

Dr. Besh is to be commended for his honesty, compassion, and professionalism. When he looked at the severity of my x-rays he really helped me through the harsh reality of the extent of the deterioration of my joints by pointing out how my joints had fused on their own similar to the way he would have done in corrective surgery. He really helped me look on the bright side. It was obvious to me that his interest of the wellbeing of his patients trumps any financial gain. He recommended that I go to his physical therapy clinic to maximize the mobility that remains in my hands. During my follow up consultation with him after I had therapy, it was my pleasure to give him an A+ 5 stare rating on the professionalism of his clinic. With gratitude, Cheri Carroll< /Text>

<Review>Dr Besh is very thorough and helpful. He takes time to understand the patients' problems and then explains to them what they are going through and what options they have. This takes time but you feel so much more comfortable. I went to him for an ailment which could have been handled by another doctor with a different specialization. Dr Besh himself gave me this advice after examining me. He then recommended another doctor and didn't take any fees even though he spent time studying my case.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Five stars to Dr. Besh, his attentive staff and the PT team! The service was above and beyond my expectations. The office is very sanitary and equipped for Corvid 19 with hand sanitizers, tissues and temperature checks managed by the receptionist prior to visits.
Dr. Besh is kind, caring & very knowledgeable. I was actually looking forward to my surgery on trigger left long finger and De Quevrain left thumb ,  knowing that I would be under his care.. Post-surgery doctor visits and PT sessions are conveniently scheduled back-to-back and on the same floor.
Would recommend Dr. Besh to family and friends. Thank you, Dr. Besh!<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><time>1581562970335< /time><Pics>None< /Pics><review>I visited Dr. Besh due to a trigger finger problem.  Office staff was very nice and professional.
Dr Besh is a very personable doctor who spent type examining and explaining my situation, and providing visuals to further clarify.
What impressed me the most is his encouragement and honesty regarding receiving therapy rather that just go for more intrusive and expensive treatment like surgery. I appreciated this, since it kept me functional and did not impact my work. I eventually completed therapy and I can say I have greatly improved the trigger finger situation. Doctors can advise, but the work is on you.
I recommend Dr Besh to my family and friends.</review>< Response>

<Text>I went to this location not knowing what my outcome or what news of my injuries would be. After meeting Dr. Besh for the first time I knew I was in the best hands. From the first meeting and all of physical therapy sessions, surgery and all of the office visits not one day was I ever disappointed. I can’t say enough about this facility, it’s just a wonderful and professional place. To Dr. Besh and office personnel and of course all the therapists thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Continue the amazing work and I’ll definitely recommend it to everyone with honor.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Dr. Besh is my hero. I have Dupuytrans contracture my ring finger & pinky were completely closed. They hadn't opened in 5 years. I went to Dr. Besh & he did surgery to release the contractures. Let's just say the man is gifted because there isn't enough space to write all the good things I would like to say about him . My hand is fixed. I can use my hand because all my fingers now open & close. He did this after another doctor (who I won't name) screwed up on 2 previous surgeries. I never thought I would ever be able to have the proper use of my hand again . Then I met Dr. Besh he fixed my hand & believe me when I say I didn't give him much to work with. I thank God every morning for Dr. Besh because once again I can wash my face with both hands. Try washing your face with one hand to get an idea of how highly I think of Dr. Besh & how gifted a doctor he is. Like I said there isn't enough room to write all the good things I could say about him.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>In absolute disbelief at this doctor and how RUDE he is and total lack of respect for anyone but himself.
Had seen him prior and he had no problem taking my insurance money.
I made an appointment for today and they called me and told me they had made a mistake and my appointment time was unavailable and I needed to come in 30 minutes earlier. So, I arrive prior to the newly scheduled time, asked if I needed to have X-rays, etc. and was told no that was not necessary.
After waiting for more than an hour past my originally (later scheduled time), I asked the receptionist when I would be seen as I had moved multiple other appointments to accommodate their error on scheduling. She assured me multiple times that I was next, well that is clearly a lie Dr. Besh tells his staff to tell people, because I watched as all the new people coming in the door with later appointment times be seen before me. I asked again at the front desk, and she said that I was next….oh, that line again, and I explained to her that people arriving more than 40 minutes after me with later appointments were being seen before me and that was not right. She just stared at me blankly and said I am so sorry.  BTW very time in the past I went there similar wait times were experienced but I had never been treated this terrible before or I would not have given them my business again. I can in good faith say I will NEVER give them m business again.
But here is where things get ridiculous. I was taken into a room (FINALLY) after waiting well over an hour past my appointment time, and was asked by Dr. Besh’ assistant for my medical records from a different doctor I had seen prior, I told her I did not have them and was not told that I needed them otherwise I could have gotten them. I explained to her that I simply wanted to have a brief consult with Dr. Besh, which mind you I was paying via insurance handsomely for, and she said “ I’m sorry you cannot see him without your records”, and I said this is not even related to those, I simply want to discuss options with Dr. Besh and if needed I could happily return for another appointment with any paperwork or imaging he needed.
I told her that I had all my previous X-rays on my phone I could forward/show to her, but she said, without a formal medical report I was not permitted to meet with the doctor. I said I do not need a diagnosis, I just want a follow up visit/consult for which I had seen Dr. Besh for previously and had an appointment for.
She said “No, I’m sorry you cannot see the doctor” She then told me she would like to send me down for X-rays and that she needed the medical report so when that was done she could schedule another appointment. I repeated that I had the x-ray results with me and that I only wished to consult with Dr. Besh at this visit and she said, “well you can’t until you provide us with your medical records”
What the heck, so I have to have every doctor I have ever seen in my past history records to be able to have a simple 5 minute conversation with Dr. Besh? Which I paid to have!!!
Yah, no thanks, won’t be seeing this doctor EVER again, and will refer anyone that asks away from him. Poor unethical business practices, if this is a reflection of his skill as a surgeon, then I certainly dodged a bullet there.
Hope others do not experience the same treatment.
I should have headed the warnings from other reviewers on his lack of professionalism, yelling and poor treatment of his employees, and inconsiderateness in making patients wait ridiculous lengths of time.
Run, don’t walk from this doctor.
By the way, I have NEVER written a bad review anywhere in my life but this warranted warning others.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

I had this shooting/stabbing pain under my left thumb nail for over 10 years, which was random on almost all the time and often kept me awake at night.  I went to different doctors, dermatologist, neurologist, acupuncturists, nobody had a clue, some doctor even said it's in my brain:-)  Dr. Besh is a very experienced hand specialist, he immediately suspected it's Glomus tumour and a simple MRI scan showed this to be the case. He did an excellent small operation (15mins of surgery) and removed the tumour.  Now my nail is growing back and I've had NO pain since then, and I can sleep well every night, what a relief! After over 10 years, it's magical! Thanks, Dr. Besh!< /Text>

I just found out a nurse that is taking care of me in the hospital has also a trigger thumb and is in a lot of pain, and I told her to ask her PCP to refer her to Dr Besh.

I meant to write this some time ago but forgot. Dr. Besh was the most interested, caring doctor I have ever met. He made me feel that I was the most important person around. Never rushes; answers every question as if nothing else mattered. And the surgery was very successful. Physical therapists and x-ray facilities all on the premises. I give them all an A++.< /Text>

I had an unique experience with Dr Basil Besh as he treated for Cubital Tunnel Syndrome on my left elbow area causing severe nerve pain on little finger with a surgery and follow up service. He has good understanding of the Patient problem and provide just right medical advise and services. I would recommend for his service and physical therapy facility very conveniently located in Fremont.</review>

I had a bicycle wreck and injured my finger badly. The front office was able to squeeze me in the same day, first thing morning after my accident. Within about 40 minutes I had been checked in, x-rays expertly taken, and Dr. Besh gave me some very helpful advice and explained what to expect from the healing process. I'm so glad I got seen quickly by such a competent, knowledgeable, friendly doctor and staff.<//review>

Dr. Besh was polite and direct. His therapists have cultivated ways to get patients up to 100% which must have taken years to compile. These steps are a little out of the box solutions, but they contributed heavily to my recovery.</text>

< Review>
TL;DR: Remember the TV show about Dr. House, a physician who loved solving medical mysteries? Well, Dr. Besh is not that kind of doctor. I guess he might be able to help you, if your issue is completely mundane, like a typical case of carpal tunnel syndrome or run-of-the-mill trigger finger. With anything more complicated you'll probably be better off going elsewhere.

I saw Dr. Besh for an injury that was difficult to diagnose. I'd seen another surgeon before him, and that first doctor had told me that he wasn't sure how to treat my injury. Dr. Besh was recommended to me as an experienced hand & wrist specialist, so I decided to get a second opinion from him.

Dr. Besh barely looked at my injury. What he did look at were previous doctor's notes and conclusions from my CT scan and MRI. When I asked why he was only looking at radiologists' conclusions and not at the actual images, he said that according to some study radiologists were better at interpreting them, so he never even tried. Hopefully you can see the problem with his reasoning here.

Dr. Besh essentially took previous physician's notes as gospel. The previous physician wasn't sure what exactly was wrong, and Dr. Besh repeated pretty much the same thing without even trying to perform his own examination.

In an attempt to stimulate his thought process I told him about a case report where a rare injury with symptoms very similar to mine was treated surgically. He looked like I punched him right into his ego. He said that maybe I should see the doctors who wrote that report instead of him. Ironically, that was the only good advice I got from him.

At some point Dr. Besh said "your injury doesn't make sense to me". He speculated that my arm was just stiff from the cast that I wore right after the injury and recommended physical therapy and pain medication. When I asked what pain meds were for, he said that I would need to push through pain when doing PT and therefore would need something to manage pain. Then he stopped and stared at me for several seconds. I guess he was trying to see if I was an addict trying to score some pills. That was quite an unpleasant experience.

I refused the pain meds but decided to give PT a try and talked to a physical therapist working with Dr. Besh. Unlike Dr. Besh he told me that pushing through pain during PT wasn't a good idea, which was more in line with what I'd previously heard from doctors and physical therapists. I asked to show me some exercises and then tried doing those exercises for a few weeks. Apart from increased pain there was absolutely no effect.

Eventually I found a specialist who was able to come up with a more specific diagnosis. It turned out I did need a surgery after all.

Overall I was very disappointed with Dr. Besh. All he did was read me my previous medical records, which I had already read myself and recommended treatment that could cause more harm than good, especially if I did push through pain as he suggested. If I continued working with Dr. Besh, I could still be doing painful and unhelpful physical therapy, possibly getting addicted to opioids in the process.<//Review>

My experience has been on going for over a year and a half and all I have to say about Dr Besh and his staff are amazing things. I would seriously have to name every single individual on his staff if I wanted to tell you who's amazing. Some people who have gone above and beyond are Dr Besh, Kim, Erica, both Kevins, Andrew, Racheal, Kelly T and my favorite Stephanie. Every one of you have made me a better person just by knowing you. Thank You

On a side note MARTIN A is an absolute meathead. Most of your posts are negative on your laundry list of comments . What's up with your ridiculous comments about Stephanie at Dr Besh's office? Singling out a person because of there opinion  doesn't feel very good does it? I just hope that you said something to her face and not just the Net like a real man. These folks at Dr Besh's office are Saints. Every one of them and people that think other wise are just negative Nancy's in our beautiful nation.

Conservative,

Dr. Besh & his staff are very friendly,  polite, professional & very knowledgeable about their profession, very clean office, waiting room.

The staff over at PT are very polite and team, professional, knowledgeable of their profession, very sweet, caring, gentle, understanding about your pain, very clean room, friendly staff.

I have been going to Dr. Besh & PT for the past 2 1/2 yrs having problems with my hands, fingers, wrist & they all are very good & helped me relieve most of pain, I love them all, you can become friends with the staff very quickly cause they are so sweet, kind, friendly people.< /Review>

<Review>Dr Besh was excellent . He had me back to work within 3 months after a broken hand and a surgery to repair it along with physical therapy to ensure my hand would heal 100%.
This was a great experience  and I would recommend him to anyone who needs a doctor who can get you back to work as soon as possible</Review>< user_name>

I was in a bad car accident last July which resulted in a dislocation and fracture in my left hand. I met with Dr. Besh the day after and I was in surgery the very next day. Amazing results and the best staff as well. I never felt insecure about the process or nervous about the results.

The PT staff was amazing to work with as well and over the course of 5 months my hand is back to its former self.

I would highly recommend Dr. Besh and his staff to anyone. Hope you never have to meet him like me.</review>

<Review>Dr Besh and Crew, are very professional and I had an over the top experience, The only reason, i give 4 stars is the Paraffin wax dip, to my opinion that is nasty and bacteria sharing with other patient's. I opted out, get the sterile warm hand wrappings instead. Thank You !</Review>< pictures>

And I got  my hand fixed which was messed up and Dr Besh fixed it with no hassle at all.  he was right to the point from the minute he walked in to the post op visit . That guy rocks and REALLY know his stuff.

Personal opinions in the workplace should be kept to yourself. As I was in this office today at about 1:30. An employee named Stephanie decided to stop as the television was playing a clip of our president speaking and said he looked like a redneck. I let her know this was not something she should be saying when she was at work. Very disappointed.</review>

< Review>
Had smashed my right index finger 4 months ago and had seen a few Hand Surgeons who were either to busy, lazy or uncaring to give me a prognosis. After a internet search and reading the reviews written of Dr. Besh made an appointment. Dr. Besh took the time to examine, listen and relay to me that the healing was going to take much longer than expected, what to do in the meantime but that the finger will heal. Why can't other Doctors be this professional?<//Review>

I am Dr. Besh’s patient and I was happy with his diagnosis.  He recommended therapy.

I am a Medical Interpreter and I interpret for him and Spanish speaking patients that he treats.

I recommend Dr. Besh highly since I see positive results as a patient, as well as, his patients that I interpret for.

His staff are very courteous, efficient, professional, friendly and helpful.  They try to accommodate all his patients and they always leave his office happy with the service they all provide.

I have referred a lot of patients that want to have a second opinion to Dr. Besh.

The only issue patients comment is that Dr. Besh needs to give them a little more time because they feel he seems to rush to go to the next patient and they feel pressured and sometimes they forget to ask the questions they wanted to ask him..

He is the best Hand-Surgeon out there. He is a fresh of breath air and he treated me like I was his family. He is a kind hearted doctor that made me feel so comfortable while I was dealing with two broken fingers my middle finger and my right ring finger on my right hand last November. I was referred to him from my primary care doctor and it was the best decision I had ever made to see Dr. Besh. He did my surgery right away because I was in so much pain and couldn't handle it. Its been 8 months and I'm getting back to normal everyday. Its going to take some time for my fingers to get 110% better. But whatever Doctor Besh has recommended to me I have listened and I do my finger exercises at home. His staff from his front office, to back office, to his therapy department, to surgery department they are all an exceptional and phenomenal group of healthcare workers. All healthcare offices should actually learn a thing or two from them. They make you feel like your at home and give you the utmost respect.  Thank you so much to Dr. Besh, his staff Josh, Kevin, Stephen, Veronica, all his medical assistants, front office staff and back office staff for making me feel welcomed during my time of need. They have become more than just my doctors office, they have become a second family to me. They have been there for me through the up's and downs in my life. I appreciate every single one of you and I recommend anyone who has any type of hand problem or a broken bone to go to Dr. Basil Besh he will fix it right up and make you feel back to normal. Thank you once again to Doctor Basil Besh and staff you guys are amazing!

< Review>
I have been going to Dr. Besh and hand therapy for about 2 1/2 years. I started with therapy I was afraid to have surgery for carpal tunnel and cubical tunnel. Dr Besh knew I needed it but waited until I was ready. Once I had surgery I was mad at myself for waiting so long. In the end I had bilateral carpal and cubical tunnel surgery and bilateral basil joint. Thank you Dr. Besh, your office staff and hand therapy you guys are great.</Review>

<Review>The 1st appointment itself Dr Besh gave an understandable explanation for the pain, treatment options for a wrist injury that has been troubling me for close to 3 months. Dr Besh office is very professional and efficient. All requisite forms emailed to me prior the appointment. Promptly sent me for another X_RAY into an adjoining office and X-RAY digitally available for Doctors review withing minutes. Dr office also scheduled an MRI appointment within hours and btw the open box MRI @ the Farewell facility is so much better than the enclosed ones.<//Review>< pics>

William St. Lawrence DVM is the best. His follow up puts you at ease when  you're a wreck cause you don't know what's going on with your pet. His staff is great too. Joanna at Portola has helped me tremendously.</text>

Candice and her staff were amazing! They were so friendly in the most genuine way I felt welcomed and they really showed me that I can trust them with handling my puppy. Candice showed her professionalism in such a way almost like we were friends! It was really refreshing. I really trust this place to take care of your pet needs, honest. I appreciate their commitment and family service (:</text>

<review>I have been taking my dog and cat here for over a year. They have performed two surgeries for lipoma removal on my dog and dental extractions. Their prices are reasonable and the staff is amazing! They have always been extremely responsive and treat my pets like they are their own. Our friend who works at a different vet office actually recommended them and now we are customers for life!<//review>< pictures>

<text>Our dog Maker loves this place! Everytime we are close he recognizes the smells of warmth, kindness and compassion. The staff here are great and are very responsive to include the doctors returning phone calls in a timely manner. We have been going here a long time and will continue to do so, due to the great customer service and their love for Maker!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdbBTqis1mQQpRRKD-3t_yoRlBxRUuJzgiS8ta=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
All my three babies (a dog and two cats) go to Village Square Woodside Vet. The doctors and nurses are super caring and experienced. The charges are reasonable as well. They don’t try to sell me unnecessary exams like some other vets I used to go to.< /Review>

I couldn't ask for better care for my dog. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they charge reasonable prices. When the practice changed hands a year or two ago around 2018 there were a few bumps in the road but everything seems to be running smoothly now. Highly recommended< /text>

< review>
Ollie had spinal surgery for herniated discs in his lower back a few months ago in Houston. With a lot of after care, he did very well. We moved to California 2 months ago and he continued to recuperate until a few days ago. Same congenital problem. Took him to emergency care at another clinic because Ollie was in pain and began dragging his foot. An anti-inflammatory/pain reliever, sedatives and confinement were prescribed. We could be looking at more surgeries. Took Ollie in to our regular vet at Woodside Vetinary Clinic where they suggested we try an alternative to surgery and another long, painful recovery. Acupuncture. I was apprehensive, but the doctor explained the procedure in great detail and how many dogs find relief (in addition to lifestyle changes).  Very calming and caring staff. Day 1 immediately after acupuncture, Ollie is calm and relaxed.  Also started an anti inflammatory/neuropathic pain reliever, Ollie appears to be pain free and is eating and wagging his tail again. Not so when he was previously sedated and in a zombie state all day. Day 2, still pain free. Will see how it goes after 2 more sessions. Surgery would be the last alternative. Here is Ollie relaxing during his first session. Can barely see the needles. Will update.</review>

Very considerate. They have a little sign at entrance saying if the light's on, that means someone is saying goodbye to their loved pets, and please be quiet and sensitive. That's so nice!

The staff are nice and always willing to help. They answer their phone promptly. Great appointment availability. The rooms are neat and bright.
Although, the veterinarian is always in a rush... Wish she could slow down and be more patient.<//Text>

< review>
I just needed to share this about Village Square Vet Clinic on Woodside Road in Redwood City
It breaks my heart to write this review. I just started going to this clinic, and I am finding the care and results to get my dog out of pain is not working due to the care she is receiving. My dog has a spine shoulder injury. Over the years she has done I cannot even count how many acupuncture sessions​. She hates them​ and starts to shake, and tense up, but in the end,​ at another vet​, I have seen results so that is why I take her. The last vet not only uses a calming spray​ but also ​creates a calm​ environment​ he placed a needle in her to calm her down. This hasn't happened at Village Square. Out of the 5 appointments 2 times they have run late. While sitting in the room my dog is sitting and shacking tensing​ up. When the vet came in today I asked her with my dog being so tense doesn't that defeat​ the entire purpose. She told me I could reschedule that it isn't ideal. When it happened on Tuesday I did the treatment with no​ results so I booked Thursday. When they ran late again today I realized it didn't make any sense​ to spend over 200 plus dollars to have a treatment, and take my dog home in pain again. They need to show the same respect I showed them by showing up on time to the animal. The last vet who I have a phone call out to who spent the calming time with the animal I asked when he knew when to take the needles​ out. He said they start to come out. I watched this happen with a couple of dogs I brought to him. The time at Village Square they put the needles in is more of an appointment time thing estimating​ 20 minutes. The other vet spent an hour for less money, and what is most important I received​ better results. They need to get it together. You pay top dollar but do not get top service.
I have had a good experience with the Portola Valley Clinic years ago, but I am wondering if purchasing the Redwood City Clinic was a good idea. Maybe they​ should focus on one clinic.
I will say the people are nice, but nice and results​ are two different things. I am going for results. Running late two out of five times for this treatment with this animal isn't OK. Nor will it provided the needed results to get my dog out of pain.

08/01/19 - Decided it would be counter-productive​. Left without treatment.
07/30/19 - $215.00
06/20/19 - $215.00
06/15/19 - $279.50

<Text>Would give 10 stars if I could! Front office staff was super polite and respectful. The online sign up made it all a snap. Booked my appointment and set up my payment without ever having to call or set foot in the office. Once on our visit, Greg was very gentle and thoughtful about my dog's experience at the office. He was very generous with treats, and insured that my dog had a positive experience with everything, from the table, to the scale, the needles, and the technician. One of the best vet visits we have ever had. Thanks guys!!</Text>< name>

Wonderful touch to show they care and remember our pet. Super easy to come back and get more antibiotics, the vet even remembered us and asked how our dog was doing. Discussed the issue and gave recommendations for the next two weeks. Really love this place and highly recommend. Would give more stars if I could!</review>< Pics>

Great place! I followed Dr. Ravn here from another office and I am happy I did!  The staff is welcoming and processional from the moment you walk through the door. Despite what some of the other reviews, said about cleanliness, I've never seen the lobby or exam rooms in need of a cleaning.  My pets have received nothing but the best care here!< /text>

I had my first appointment 7/11/19 and even though the vet seemed personable and nice I did not appreciate the snarky attitude of the dirty-blonde haired assistant. I felt like she judged the way I train my dogs and that's none of her business.<//text>

<text>Very unreliable and unprofessional vet. They just want to charge you for everything. The doctor doesn't know what toxoplasmosis is (a common parasite in cat feces that can cause birth defects in pregnant women) and didn't recommend a test although we clearly mentioned that my wife is pregnant. Our physician was shocked to hear that. Don't waste you money and time. Find another vet!< /text>< Pics>

This used to be a great practice before new management took over. I was appalled at the decline in service since then, particularly with the veterinarian! The first experience I had with her, I was asked to reschedule after dragging my cat out due to an emergency, or wait a long time, which I could not, so the veterinarian spent very little, rushed time with my cat.
Then my cat got ill from exposure to a virus at that visit, so I had to return a week later. Again, the veterinarian was rushed, looking at her watch, which I understand, as I was 15 min. late, due to weather conditions. However, there is no excuse for how rude she was towards me, treating me like I was a stupid child, asking me to tell her what she just said and why, being condensing and demeaning...unbelievably disrespectful and never present with my animal, always in a rush.
If you care about your pets, take them somewhere else!</Text>

I have worked with Dr. St. Lawrence and Dr. Calhoun, and have been very impressed with both.

Dr. St. Lawrence was thorough in explaining options for my dog when I brought her in for anxiety and pacing, and happy to answer all of my (many!) questions. He sent follow up emails to check on my dog several weeks after her appointment, and even filled a prescription over email when I decided to get some meds for her a couple months after her anxiety appointment.  I have recommended Woodside to a friend who brought her dog in for blood work, and Dr. St. Lawrence sent her a follow up email to check on her pooch too.

Dr. Calhoun saw my dog for a consultation and then a dental to remove all of her teeth. He was incredibly understanding of my need to understand and know about every charge on our bill, and was very honest about what is and isn't needed and the pros and cons of every decision. On one visit he came out to the waiting room as I was paying just to say goodbye to my dog -- he clearly was enamored with her and it's wonderful to have a vet that so clearly loves pets as much as their owners do. In the weeks after her dental Dr. Calhoun continued to help me figure out the most cost effective plan for post-op pain meds, even if it included ordering some things online not through the clinic.

Do your own research for your needs, but from what I've gathered Woodside seems on the low end cost-wise for vets in this area, and I couldn't be happier with the care my dog has received.

Update: I have since also worked with Dr. Ravn and she was wonderful. SO thoughtful and thorough with explanations and care of my beloved pup.<//Text>

Loved my stay here at the Sea View Inn, the location was great and just a short walk to the beach. The room had an amazing view of the ocean which gave great sunset views. Staff was extremely nice and room was very clean. Highly recommend staying here as well as utilizing the free beach accessories provided by the hotel.</text>

<Review>This is a great place to stay at, staff is very courteous and helpful. The grounds were kept clean,  rooms are very spacious and comfortable. My wife and I had a great time. Reasonable prices for a location so close to the Beach. Definitely will stay here again!</Review></record>

<Text>The Sea View Inn has gotten it right, from the incredible location and views of Manhattan Beach to the down-home charm of vintage art, clean, cozy rooms with lovely views (even from the shower), balconies, and freshly ground coffee, to a heated pool, free use of cruiser bikes and beach gear, convenient parking, and impeccable service. This place has a futuristic-retro vibe that makes us want to return again and again. Meeting the owners was a true pleasure, as I had already been singing their praises to my Girlfriend before I realized who they were. We have both traveled extensively, and highly recommend the Sea View Inn.</Text>< Time>

<Review>It was my first time to go to Los Angeles especially Manhattan Beach. My friends told me that we would stay at one of the greatest hotels which we could see the beautiful sea from the room windows and yes, it was all true! For me, this hotel gave me such a warm feeling to enjoy my time with my friends. The rooms were so clean and smell good. The staffs were so friendly to us and so helpful too. Our concern at the time was only the WiFi which did not work really well, but we didn't really care since we had so much good time to chit chat at the balcony of our room. Moreover, it's so close to go to everywhere around Los Angeles. And the best moment that I had is when I borrowed the bike from the hotel to go around the Manhattan Beach. It's so fantastic! If you consider to visit Manhattan Beach area or maybe Los Angeles, then this is the first hotel you can choose! So recommended!</Review>< date>

The location was good.   Nice added amenities like bikes.  However walls are very thin. My room was located next to the office and stair case.  Could hear everything and kept me up all night.  People checking in until 11pm right outside my door and then being up luggage and then being woke up again as early as 5am. Plus they are remodeling and they started at 8.  Very noisy and was not relaxing.  If you stay hete be careful what room you get.</review>

The area is very nice and is close to everything, but also feels like you're not really in LA.<//review><Time>1606435200000<//Time>< username>

<review>The cutest vintage beach style cottage. Free bike rentals and beach gear was so convenient! The oven didn't work guessing because it's really old (vintage style) but the stove worked and it was fully stocked with Kitchenware. The cottage is upstairs and the walk from the beach back to the cottage is a good uphill hike so I wouldn't recommend it for elderly or people who have limited mobility. Otherwise, great place, location and staff!< /review><GmapID>0x80c2b3de2d486ba3:0x6538e461d627cd5e< /GmapID>< Rate>

<Review>We had a great stay in early March. Cozy room to hide from the weather with super soft sheets. The view was also beautiful when things cleared up. Very close to some great cafes and bars, and not a long walk to the pier.

<Text>I wanted a reasonable and decent hotel near the beach for a quick family trip. I think Sea View Inn was a good choice.Front desk was friendly. Location is good with restaurants within 5-10 minute walk.My only concern was we were in one of the upper rooms at the back and there was no smoke detector on the hallway. I didn't feel completely safe.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
I stayed here just for some mom me time. It's close to my house and every time I passed by I would say I'm gonna stay there one day. My room was tiny and I would've chosen  somewhere else had I known just how smal rooms were but I was rushing and just booked it. If you're from out of town do your research. If you just want somewhere to sleep after you get tired of surfing or boarding it's perfect. Luxury will slap this place in the face with a white glove for a dual but it's clean, has free wifi, and you can walk to several dining spots and convenience/liquor stores. The walk to the beach a skip. It's got a retro beach bum vibe. Totally dude!</Review>

<Text>The room is small in the original hotel but comfortable. If you want a bigger room you should upgrade. The bed is comfortable and everything worked like it should in our room. It looks like the rooms have all been updated. The hotel will let you check out chairs, buggy boards, umbrellas and bikes for no charge. The beach is about two blocks away. The neighborhood is very quite.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRPZ-zfEnBvVXi1Hh8Ccwll2mvyQPtZatkrmtO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVRBfpDwPi8dpmisemb-GDWWpMAU6hkf4FGUXs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuW8l1uWTpK0ORbPtuamtKxHZ2ZWwYhxvlfsSH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORdGL7QURMw_JDV7HwJW1xTzlqH2G2ifr8XWVZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The most disappointing was the cleanliness of our room. The floor was very dirty and when i took my shoes off i felt dirt and dust under my feet. I expected more considering this hotel is in Manhattan beach.</Text>

<Review>The place was a mess. I spent the first 20 minutes when we first arrived on my hands and knees cleaning up dead flies throughout the apartment and killing a cockroach in the kitchen. Zero percent chance that the apartment was cleaned between visitors. The beds were made but the floor and overall cleanliness was seriously gross. I honestly don’t need a spotless place, but the condition of this place was intolerable by anyone’s standards.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Adequate rooms with an unbelievable view. The room was clean and had coffee (this is important)

Great location with a bakery downstairs (with coffee) close to lots of restaurants and Moon’s liquor store.

The rooms are quite a value and it’s just a short walk to the beach.< /Text>

The property was clean and large enough for our family. We had the 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment and the rooms were a good size. The view of the water was pretty but not as close as I thought it would be. The location was just a walk down a steep hill to the beach. Staff was excellent, friendly and helpful. The only bad thing I can say is the WiFi is extremely slow and sometimes not working at all so be prepared for that. They have a pool but we didn’t use it since we were by the beach. I would definitely stay at this property again.</Review>

This hotel is in a great location! The best thing about it is the complimentary beach equipment including chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards.  We took advantage of the free bikes and had a glorious ride down the coast! Keith at the desk is very nice. Only downfall is a bit noisy from room next door. Thin walls!</text>

<text>I really loved our stay at Sea View Inn!  It’s not fancy or pristine. But it’s just so nice and welcoming and I left feeling great about our time there. If you don’t go expecting five star hotel perfection you’ll just love the view, the proximity to the beach, it’s affordability, and your feeling of being a part of Manhattan Beach instead of a separate tourist.  And the unit really had everything we needed.  I think we’ll go again and stay longer. After a four day stay it felt like home and I miss it!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Sizable rooms just blocks from the beach. We were in a large 2 bedroom unit with 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, and excellent views of the ocean. Parking is available but large cars will be tricky. Pool is on premises. Several good restaurants and a corner market are within 1 block.< /Review>

<Date>1487721600000<//Date><Rate>None< /Rate><text>Our room at the top floor of the northwest unit had a sea view, although not a beach view, so you saw the ocean but not the waves. The two queen beds were very comfortable, the linens and towels were high quality. The room was a good size. The check-in and check-out were easy and the hotel offers free use of bikes and beach equipment (we didnt use those).It was great to have a coffeemaker provided with real coffee rather than the packaged pods. Nice refrigerator and microwave.The location is great for access to local restaurants within 1 to 4 blocks. You could choose from four breakfast spots, pizza, sandwiches, Mexican, beach cuisine, and sports bars, all local rather than chain restaurants.The beach is down a significant hill, but once you take the hike you can enjoy walking or biking on the Strand for miles, wading, surfing, etc.Biggest drawback: The shower has no soap dish at all. You have to put your soap, shower gel, shampoo, etc. on the floor of the shower. Thats a slipping hazard as well as inconvenient. The bathroom itself was quite small without much space to lay out your grooming articles. The shower enclosure goes to the ceiling, I believe, so you cant even bring your own hanging shower trolley to use. This is why I gave room comfort a 3 score.That said, I would likely choose this hotel again as I loved the rest of the features and the location.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Stayed in a good sized one bedroom cottage. Had a full kitchen which was awesome. Nice bathroom. Comfy bed but most importantly was the location to the beach. It's a minute walk away. So beautiful. With the window open in the bedroom at night you can hear the ocean. Not super luxurious but I didn't stay for that I stayed for the proximity to the beach. Great place.< /text>

Service was excellent, we were able to check in early.  Free bikes were OK.  They are cruisers w/o gears so hills were tough.  Room was very nice, we were at the end of our trip so didnt go down to the beach, but it was visible, about 2 blocks away.  We did go for drinks and dinner within a few blocks.  Its about 2 miles from the pier and downtown area with tons of shops and bar/restaurants.< /review>

Take advantage of the free beach equipment they have to offer; bikes, beach chairs, body boards, etc.  I can’t wait to go back; Manhattan Beach is awesome!!!< /text>< Response>

<Text>Loved that the facility has free three hour bike rentals, but you have to have them back by 7 which is a bummer. It's nice there is a pool but is not heated and even I  September it's too cold to use. I was in the smaller of the two penthouses and it was two bedroom one bath with a kitchen. Great unit that sleeps 6 when using the pull out Couch. Awesome view, would stay again for sure.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>dont show up late. no keys, no messages, no one at the desk, hotel voice mail full, and no credit. 1:00 AM my business partner had to find another hotel - Management here is completely unreasonable. Said they left a note taped to the door. Did Management ever consider that a taped note could come off the door? There was no message. Had to find another Hotel. thankfully the Residence Inn Marriott is close by and had a live body to talk to and rooms available.< /text>< Pictures>

I called, explained the situation and they continued to impress us with their understanding. We will be back at the Sea View Inn any and every time we visit southern LA. You guys rock!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>We truly enjoyed our stay at the Seaview Inn at the Beach.  The staff was friendly and helpful - recommending restaurants, providing beach cruiser cycles for The Strand. The overall vibe was casual and friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable and we had a nice wide view of the ocean from our balcony.  Its a great location if youre looking to hang out on Manhattan Beach and Hermosa beach.< /text>< rate>

So my time in California was brief, so to make the most of it, we rented here as it was close to the airport. I unfortunately left a pair of shoes under the bed in my room. I let my sister know right away (the same day that we left) and she called the hotel well before the next person was able to rent the room that day, and they told her there were no shoes in the room or in the lost and found.  Now I brought and left with my 1 carry on bag. Now tell me again how there was no shoes in the room???? The door was locked when we left AT 4 AM. No one was in the room except the cleaners. Not even new tenants before we called. If I were you, I wouldn't stay here.<//Text>

<rate>None<//rate><text>This is a small cluster of older buildings and is a short walk to a quiet beach. We stayed in the beach house which is a 1 BR apartment. It is nestled between buildings with no view. Very clean and quaint. Good eats nearby (breakfast at the Local Yolk is wonderful).Adequate free parking, it is  nice that you can get free beach towels/ chairs/ umbrellas/volleyball/ from the desk for the day. Beware that the office is closed at night so you have to check in before they close. We were here in October and it was quiet, beach was not at all crowded.  Lovely time. We were here for our college daughters Parents Weekend at USC.  Decided to stay well away from campus and downtown LA. Easy to get to. Will come again.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

What a cozy hotel with amazing views of the ocean! Clean rooms, and many with a balcony and a view. Literally blocks away from the beach, it's like a vacation away from home. Friendly staff can help you navigate the town, and even provide beach supplies!

Pro tip - there are different buildings the rooms are in, I suggest asking for the ones in the water side. That way you don't have to cross a fairly busy street when you head down to the beach!</text>

<text>The location is perfect! It lives up to it's name--the view is gorgeous. It's 3 blocks from the beach, and they have bikes and beach supplies to check out. It's also close to great restaurants and shopping, and the pier. The rooms are clean. Our room has 2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, and a great living space. It's been perfect for our family trip. Cons: Some features are dated, the beds are not great, and our sliding bathroom door was kind of broken and difficult to close.<//text>< gmap_id>

What a GEM! As a family we have never come across a more family friendly space.That space is in a very cool, on the beach, corner of LA. Nothing is too much trouble, the rooms can cater for everybody, from singles, all the way up to families of six (as we are) with no drama at all, that means no rollaway beds or sofa beds to cope with the extra family members. Bikes, beach towels, boards, all available (FREE).Do your self, (and whoever you travel with) a favour and get yourselves into the SEA View at the beach.You can thank me later.
Sam, Matt, Jackson, Cooper, Hudson and Jesse. (Yamba, NSW Australia).
P.S. The Sea View is what you look at from every window.< /Review>

Quite possibly the friendliest establishment in the LA area. Location is perfect for business meetings in nearby El Segundo or at LAX and is just steps away from the beach and running path. Walking distance to all the great restaurants in El Porto/Manhattan Beach. Clean, comfortable room with a view ... plus free parking and WiFi.</Text>

In all likelihood, the worst hotel room, and value for money, that I have experienced.I have stayed at more hotels than I can possibly remember - but I will always remember this room. The pits in every way - terrible smell, damp/leaking, cramped, no outlook at all, old, dilapidated, dirty etc etc. Honestly, there would be basement rooms in 19th century prisons that would have been better.Just a disgrace all around - and there is no way that anyone serious about running merely a decent customer-driven business would include such a hotel room in their room portfolio.The staff were also poor - particularly the check-in experience.I cannot speak for other rooms in the hotel - but for all ever contemplating staying at this hotel (dont - there are PLENTY of superior local choices - I know, as I have stayed at several of them - avoid Room 226 as if your life depended on it!!</Text>

This was my second stay at this Inn and I am truly DISAPPOINTED.  The walls and baseboards are dingy and the top lock doesn't lock from the inside.  I told the font office (about the lock) and his reply was "Maintenance is gone for the day . . . don't worry, you are in a safe neighborhood."  This will be my FINAL stay @ Sea View INN.  #trulydisappointed #neveragain<//text>

<review>Decent little place four blocks from the beach. The room was clean and looked nice but was quite small; still had a mini fridge and microwave though. The room looked renovated but seemed rushed; there were a couple of paint drips on the tile in the shower and the power outlets were lose (cell charger kept hitting the floor till I pushed the nightstand against it). Overall, it's on point for the cost per night. Another benefit of staying here are the bikes and all the beach gear you can rent for FREE! They also​ have a heated pool but I didn't get a chance to check it out. Bottom line, I'd stay with them again! Safe & Fun Travels​!</review><Time>1494218266493< /Time>< pics>

This place was fantastic! Excellent location just a few blocks downhill to the beach and all the beach equipment you could ever want available to borrow for free. Incredible views and literally only a block or two to coffee shops, breakfast joints, lunch/dinner, and liquor store w/small market. James, the General Manager, is about the nicest guy you will ever meet. We checked out at 11am and had the day at the beach until our 7pm flight. He was more than accommodating by letting us borrow a room that afternoon to wash off our kids before we headed out. There just aren't laid back hotels around like this anymore. This place is a can't miss in my opinion.< /text>

My husband and I stayed here for two nights last April and couldn't have asked for a better place.  Beautiful Manhattan Beach is just a block away and we could see the ocean from our bed.  Our room was lovely, clean, and airy, with a (small) private balcony and sliding glass doors.  We enjoyed shopping and dining on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, a short walk from the inn, and for night there are several local bars just down the street if you don't want to walk that far.  Go get fish and chips at Shellback Tavern while you are there!  If we had more time, we would have loved to borrow bicycles and make use of the convenient paved coastal bike paths.  Highly recommend this place!</Review>

<review>The people at the Seaview are really helpful. On a rainy day last week, after we had checked out, the manager offered our family the use of a room to hang out while we waited for our flight. We already loved the location and hearing the sound of the waves in our room - plus, this could be the freshest air in LA!<//review>< Pictures>

Location is great, staff is nice, price is very reasonable for the area. Rooms are clean but simple. Wifi never worked, maintenance requests were ignored. Overall i would go back, but don't expect anything fancy.< /Text>

I want to make an observation regarding the attitude of the worker or owner I do not know who was On August 2 my girlfriend and I booked the executive suits #504, my girlfriend arrived a few hours before and she was the one that made the reservation but she was wrong in the number she gave me by text a room #405 when I arrived at the office and I asked the young man where he was in that room he answered that he could not tell me which and  I agreed, but that if I could call To say that I was there, when him called the room they told me that they did not know me then I apologized and I retired because I knew that my girlfriend was bothering me we were texting so when i cross the street in front  the office my girlfriend from the balcony  called me and leave the door open so I left the office but when i stand only 5 meters from the door  this guy cross the street and saying that I could not go because it was private property, he told me to talk to her first so like  that she came for me,I wanted to text her but my cell die I had no battery in my cell phone, I had to leave for about 30 minutes while charging my phone, my problem was that my girlfriend wanted to go before 8pm to the pool and it was less than an hour for that Hour, as you will see I became a problem, thanks to that action I do not consider correct on the part of him, because he noticed when she called me and she  left the door open was my worst birthday thanks to one action out of context I think that the best thing that had to do the young man to see that I ran out of battery in my cell phone was to walk 5 steps with me and verify effectively that it was my girlfriend, I do not understand why if he  ran out of the office and crossed a street, Could not take 5 steps with me I went to check if I was actually going to my room</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) Our stay would be a cottage with a separate bedroom. But this space was a kind of student flat afterwards where the sofa bed was bad and the double bed was very bad. Have back pain after sleeping 1 night. Furthermore, it was very small and for 4 people with luggage not practical. From the rooms we looked at blind walls. How nice is that! We could not put bags anywhere else than on the kitchen bar and the armchair in the 'living room'. Furthermore, the bathroom was dated and full of ants. This too was too small for 4 people to put away a toilet bag and the like. We had booked 4 nights, so assume that we could store some of our luggage in the 'cottage'. Unfortunately this was not the case. Furniture was very dated and of poor quality. After 1 night we packed our bags and booked a Best Western in Manhattan Beach. This was cheaper and incl breakfast compared to the Sea View Inn. We asked for a discount because we could not cancel the 3 nights, but still had to pay the full price. And I think they have rented the space out again! Afterwards a terrible experience without empathy from the manager. In short, definitely not recommended. You have been warned.

(Original)
Ons verblijf zou een cottage zijn met aparte slaapkamer. Maar deze ruimte was een achteraf soort van studenten kot waar de slaapbank slecht was en het 2 persoonsbed zeer slecht was. Hebben er  na 1 nacht slapen rugpijn aan over gehouden. Verder was het zeer klein en voor 4 personen met bagage niet praktisch. Vanuit de kamers keken we op blinde muren. Hoe gezellig is dat! We konden koffers nergens kwijt dan op de bar van de keuken en de fauteuil in de 'woonkamer'. Verder was de badkamer gedateerd en vol met mieren. Ook deze was te klein voor 4 personen om toilet tas e.d. weg te leggen. We hadden namelijk 4 nachten geboekt, dus ga ervan uit dat we iets van onze bagage kwijt zouden kunnen in de 'cottage'. Dit was helaas niet geval. Meubels waren zeer gedateerd en van slechte kwaliteit. We hebben na 1 nacht onze biezen gepakt en een Best Western in Manhattan Beach geboekt. Deze was goedkoper en incl ontbijt itt de Sea View Inn. We hebben om een korting gevraagd omdat we de 3 nachten niet konden annuleren, maar moesten toch de volle prijs betalen. En volgens mij hebben ze de ruimte nogmaals verhuurd! Achteraf een verschrikkelijke ervaring  zonder inlevingsvermogen van de manager. Kortom zeker geen aanrader. Je bent gewaarschuwd.<//text>< Pictures>

Das Zimmer sollte ein Deluxe Room sein aber es war alles andere! Das Sofa Bett war sehr unbequem so das unserer Tochter alle Knochen weh taten. Die Brause konnte nicht verstellt werden weil der Halter defekt war. Die Einrichtung war verwohnt und wir fanden das Preis Leistung gegenüber günstigeren Hotels nicht passt. Der Pool war eiskalt und konnte nicht genutzt werden und unsere Zimmertür ließ sich kaum sperren.Wir haben den Mitarbeiter darauf angesprochen aber er meinte es war das Zimmer das wir gebucht haben.Ich kann mich nicht erinner das ich ein kaputtes abgewohntes Zimmer gebucht habe.Wir waren schon öfter in den USA aber sowas haben wir zum Glück noch nicht gehabt.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) We booked 4 nights from September 11th to 15th, 2019. Arrived at 7pm on the 11th, after 10 hours of driving, we were exhausted. Pick up our room and went for dinner, and grocery shopping being the room was very well equipped. Then we went back to relax. At bedtime, around 1:00 am, we saw some bed fleas, on pillow and bedspread. The front desk being closed, we recovered the insects, put in an airtight bag. There was also down the bed .... obviously sought another hotel to finish the night ... at 2:30 in the morning, a little shaken.
The next day, we went early to see the person at the counter, who did not even look at us when we spoke to him. He told us that it was probably us who brought back these insects (we did not even have time to unpack our bags !!!!!!)
Can not talk to the manager, not on site, do not want to talk to us. Wants to charge us the night we were there ..... we did not even sleep there!
Despite several reminders, impossible to talk to anyone, or even an answer by e-mail.
This is our 7th trip to California. We have made a multitude of hotels. This is the worst service for life, and we are pretty simple and discreet people. I do not recommend this hotel, be careful.

(Original)
Nous avions réservé 4 nuits du 11 au 15 septembre 2019. Arrivés à 19:00 le 11, après 10 heures de route, nous étions épuisés. Récupérons notre chambre et nous sommes allés souper, et faire une épicerie étant que la chambre était très bien équipée. Ensuite nous sommes revenus relaxer. Au moment de se coucher, vers 1:00 am, nous avons vu quelque puces de lit, sur oreiller et couvre-lit. Le front desk étant fermé, nous avons récupéré les insectes, mis dans un sac hermétique. Il y en avait aussi en bas du lit....avons évidement cherché un autre hôtel pour finir la nuit...à 2:30 du matin, un peu ébranlés.
Le lendemain, rapidement nous sommes allés tôt revoir la personne au comptoir, qui ne nous regardait même pas quand on lui parlait. Il nous a dit que c’était probablement nous qui avions ramené ces insectes (nous n’avons même pas eu le temps de défaire nos valises!!!!!!)
Impossible de parler au manager, pas sur place, ne veut pas nous parler. Veut nous charger la nuit que nous étions là.....nous n’avons même pas dormi là!
Malgré plusieurs relances, impossible de parler à personne, ni même une réponse par e-mail.
C’est notre 7 ème voyage en Californie. Nous avons fait une multitude d’hôtels. Il s’agit du pire service à vie, et nous sommes des gens assez simples et discrets. Je ne recommande pas cet hôtel, faites bien attention.</Review>< response>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Joost Visser< /Name><review>(Translated by Google) Spacious and beautiful apartment.
Free WiFi (which did not work optimally despite a reset).
Very good service and friendly people at the reception.
The apartment was cleaned daily but that could be better.
It is of course never as clean as at home 😉
Free towels, beach chairs, body boards, umbrella and bicycles.
That was pleasantly surprising!
Perfect location right by the sea and plenty of dining options nearby.
Worth repeating.

Gratis handdoeken, strandstoelen, bodyboards, parasol en fietsen.
Dat was aangenaam verrassend!
Perfecte locatie vlak aan zee en voldoende eetgelegenheden in de buurt.

(Translated by Google) Beach Cottage 1 Bedroom - Lower - DO NOT BOOK - JUST A BASEMENT !!!!! Stay from 21/07 to 26/07 - 5 nights
Of our 3 week US tour, this was hands down our worst place to stay. The Sea View Inn website states that this apartment is equipped with a Queen Size bed and a Queen Sofa sleeper. You therefore assume that a family with 2 children can stay perfectly. So nothing true. The apartment is outrageously small! Access to the apartment is via a narrow alley, so you constantly have a view of a blank wall. Just the same on the other side of the apartment, so a view of a blank wall. So absolutely no nice view.
The apartment is hardly suitable for even 2 adults. There are only 2 chairs / bar stools, so certainly not provided for 4 people. Then when you ask for 2 additional seats, they just say they don't have one.
When the seat is converted into a sleeping place, there is no room at all in the "living area". We had to place the coffee table on its narrowest side to make some space.
The bathroom is very small, barely 1 meter wide by approx. 2 meters long (fully enclosed shower, WC and toilet trough included).
The apartment is hardly equipped with a decent closet to place clothes. The bedroom has a built-in wardrobe, but it only has a hanging area. Furthermore, no shelf to put anything on.
On one side of the bed is barely 15 to 20 cm. The same at the foot end. Only on the other side is room with a bedside table and a little space to place the travel suitcases.
The kitchen is completely outdated with hardly any decent facilities to eat something, let alone even prepare something. Refrigerator is many years old and often makes a lot of noise.
When we made our disappointment clear in the reception, the owner appeared to be present. This one minimized the facts and laconically said that we were under no obligation to stay (knowing there was little chance of finding anything else in the high season). About the refrigerator he simply replied that it worked anyway and that we should be satisfied with that. According to the owner, the apartment was presented no differently than it actually is on the website. In our opinion, the photos clearly give a wider view than reality.
The owner was just the first unfriendly American we meet on our vacation. He himself said that we just shouldn't be so rude and aggressive.
Based on the many reviews, the other apartments will in all probability meet today's standards, but the apartment where we stayed certainly does not. Outrageously expensive for what we got for our money.
As for the accommodations that are provided, the bicycles may be better maintained. Not a single bike that was in good order.
Only plus for us was the location. The apartment and the entire complex of Sea View Inn is located 250 meters from the beach. Hence the only star we give.
We will never come back here !!!!

Beach Cottage 1 Bedroom - Lower - NIET BOEKEN - PRECIES EEN KELDER !!!!! Verblijf van 21/07 tot 26/07 - 5 nachten
Van onze 3 weekse rondreis in de VS was dit zonder meer onze slechtste verblijfplaats.  Op de website van Sea View Inn staat vermeld dat dit appartement voorzien is van een Queen Size bed en een Queen Sofa sleeper.  Je gaat er dus vanuit dat er perfect kan verbleven worden door een gezin met 2 kinderen.  Niets van waar dus.  Het appartement is schandalig klein!  Toegang tot het appartement is via een smal steegje waardoor je dus voortdurend uitkijkt op een blinde muur.  Aan de andere kant van het appartement net hetzelfde, zicht op een blinde muur dus.  Dus absoluut geen enkel mooi uitzicht.
Het appartement is zelfs nauwelijks geschikt voor 2 volwassenen.  Er zijn slechts 2 stoelen/barkrukken, dus zeker niet voorzien voor 4 personen.  Als je dan 2 bijkomende stoelen gaat vragen, dan zeggen ze gewoon dat ze er geen hebben.
Wanneer de zetel wordt omgevormd naar slaapplaats is er helemaal geen plaats meer in het "leefgedeelte". De salontafel dienden we op zijn smalste kant te plaatsen om toch wat ruimte te maken.
De badkamer is bijzonder klein, nauwelijks 1 meter breed op ca. 2 meter lang (volledig ingesloten douche, WC en toilettafal inbegrepen).
Het appartement is nauwelijks voorzien van een deftige kast om kleding te plaatsen.  In de slaapkamer is wel een ingebouwde kast maar deze is enkel voorzien van een hanggedeelte.  Verder geen enkele legplank om iets op te leggen.
Aan de ene kant van het bed is amper 15 à 20 cm.  Hetzelfde aan het voeteinde.  Enkel aan de andere kant is ruimte waar een nachtkastje staat en daarnaast nog een beetje plaats om de reiskoffers te plaatsen.
De keuken is totaal verouderd met nauwelijks deftige voorzieningen om iets te eten, laat staan zelfs iets te bereiden.  Koelkast is vele jaren oud en maakt regelmatig een hels lawaai.
Wanneer we in de receptie onze ontgoocheling duidelijk maakten, bleek de eigenaar aanwezig te zijn.  Deze minimaliseerde de feiten en zei lakoniek dat we niet verplicht waren om te blijven (wetende dat er in het hoogseizoen weinig kans was om iets anders te vinden).  Over de koelkast antwoordde hij gewoon dat ze toch werkte en dat we daarmee tevreden dienden te zijn.  Volgens eigenaar werd op de website het appartement niet anders voorgesteld dan deze in werkelijkheid is.  Volgens onze mening geven de foto's duidelijk een ruimere weergave dan de realiteit.
De eigenaar was gewoon de eerste onvriendelijke Amerikaan die we ontmoeten tijdens onze vakantie. Zelf zei hij dat we gewoon niet zo onbeleefd en agressief diende te zijn.
Afgaand op de vele recencies zullen de andere appartementen naar alle waarschijnlijkheid wel voldoen aan de normen van vandaag, maar het appartement waar wij verbleven doet dit zeker niet.  Schandalig duur voor wat we kregen voor ons geld.
Wat betreft de accomodaties die geleverd worden, mogen de fietsen beter onderhouden worden.  Geen enkele fiets die deftig in orde was.
Enig pluspunt voor ons was de locatie.  Het appartement en het volledige complex van Sea View Inn is gelegen op een 250-tal meter van het strand.  Vandaar ook de enige ster die wij geven.
Hier komen wij nooit terug!!!!<//text>

Da ich beruflich dort genächtigt habe war mir die Nähe zum L.A. Int. Airport wichtig. Das Hotel glich eher einem Motel. Das Peronal war sehr komptent und freundlich. Das Zimmer war o.k und sehr sauber. Was aber diese Hotel so empfehlenswert macht ist die Location. 5 Gehminuten zum Beach, ein endlos langer Beach mit sehr gepflegter Promenade. In unmittelbarer Umgebung eine Menge kleiner erschwinglicher Restaurants und Caffees.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The rooms do not match what is "sold" by booking. No storage in the rooms, the household is light however very well located near the beach.

Les chambres ne correspondent pas à ce qui est "vendu" par booking. Pas de rangement dans les chambres, le ménage est light par contre hyper bien situé à proximité de la plage.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>First time back after covid 19 closure, super nice as always. Very clean they actually wiped down the area after the customers leave. They are not over charging like the bellazio! And the nail techs are taking their time with each customer. Don't let it bother you that they are inside of wal-mart. You will get quality service.< /Review></record>

Got a full set done by Tina with the metallic foil design they are awesome! My fav design I've ever got. Tina is AMAZING! I also got a pedi done by a rly sweet lady who gave me a wonderful massage. Every one is kind and polite and make u feel very welcome and comfortable unlike some places I've been. I recommend making an apt tho cuz they get busy and wait times can be long.<//Review>

I asked for thin and short form  nails and they are thick, long and uneven. They are also not smooth they are lumpy.She was rough and in a rush.  I’ll have to go see someone else to fix them. The girl didn’t want to do the form nails after saying she could. I should have left but I didn’t want to be rude.</text>

Kathy and her husband both have done my nail's,  Kathy is better!!  I'm also a nail technician,  so I'm extremely critical and picky, but she has no problem working with me to make sure I'm happy, that is awesome customer service. I'm very happy with her job and highly recommend her. For the price and quality, plus color selection in polish and or Gel,  I doubt you would find better at a salon.</review>

<Text>They did a poor job, and was over priced especially when I asked for white tips. She pulled out these press on solid white nails so she didn't have to paint them ( haven't seen those sense I was a teen) then charged me $35 when this was clearly a $25 set. I normally go to "Magic nails in yuba city" they are amazing and do wonderful nails for good prices, and the staff is awesome! I've gotten jewels and done crazy things with my nails and it never cost me over $50 so when Wal-Mart charged me $35 I knew they were ripping me off, and she cut my finger with the nail Clippers to add to the horrible visit. Which yes that may be the prices their, but for the quality work it's not worth the money and I was disappointed when I saw my nails and I told them why is this $35, it's not worth $35 cause people should be honest and they both just babbled on, look at bored, look at bored see, see..... Umm yes I see but these look like I pressed them on from a Wal-Mart kit not got them done. Anyway my review is NEVER GO THEIR.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had my nails done here, French tips.  They turned out beautiful. A week later, the tips started chipping off, breaking. I went back in and showed them. The lady said, it was because I did hard work, I said I did not. She said, 'that's what they all say! She called me a lier. I could not believe it. They refused to fix them  and said Id have to pay the regular price to have them redone. I've had acrylic nails many times. That lasted for a very long time, staying beautiful. I'll never go there again. Very rude. And cheap work.</review><resp>None</resp>< Time>

<Review>Yipao coffee gave me a taste of home. Delicious coffee from Colombia that is not bitter or sour like other coffee places. Best coffee in town. Selection of coffee bags for purchase from different coffee regions in Colombia. Juices and tea also available. I only wish they had Colombian pastries but having this superb coffee will do for now. Two locations: North Park and Cardiff. Yipao also has a mobile unit so try them out you won't be disappointed</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd39KHT9pU4JODfIxEZlYpvl5hu9ixlhYEN6ng=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwc7706B44kvkEmYhDNYDwvyDoN_0PVerhfyBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSEULq9H6l9WZ4DthDH_0ZaNDf-32vikuCoNPD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZaiA3sb8fYt2qpFrz-hYCn5nMSBX0N3rthqnK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

This place was amazing! The gentleman at the counter was so patient and kind. I ordered the raspberry latte and it had a light raspberry flavor that paired nicely with the coffee. It's convenient that they have a window so you don't have to worry about being inside. Everything was clean and it wasn't busy on a Friday afternoon. Great stop for anyone passing through town for a quick cup of coffee. They have a great story (see photo), so I highly recommend Yipao!< /Review>

<text>Obsessed with Yipao Coffee is an understament! I love their coffee, my favorite is Los Cambulos and my favorite part is they're pet friendly (free treats for your furry friends!) Great location and the friendliest staff you'll ever find. Definitely recommend their Pour Over and Oat Milk Latte!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzxa4hR3Zy8OZ1TSoGnbwoa5dCAU1puMHSsjI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrrx-I_eB31Srm92igm2q5cKX9UKNnbOjQZfw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Best coffee in town. They care about every aspect of thier coffee. The owners are from Colombia and what to make sure you enjoy real Colombian coffee. If your not sure what you want ask the barista for a suggestion. Great people and great coffee.</Review>< Resp>

<text>I passed by this spot because I had picked up some food at the Thai place across the street and I purchased a bag of their Planada coffee. I got to say that this coffee is the best I have tasted in San Diego so far, it’s highly addicting! Love it.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d95585157389d5:0x33dc664660a86bda< /gmap_id>< userid>

Very yummy coffee! It’s nice to have specialty coffee in the neighborhood and being that the place is colombian, I think it brings needed diversity to the university heights community. I recommend the pour over if you’re a specialty coffee lover.<//text>

Coffee cart! This is a solid go to place on the UH area. They are a small trailer on a lot with a patio. You can tell the owner has put in the time and thought into creating a vibrant space to sit and have a good coffee with friends or grab it to go. Price is fair and the coffee I thought was really good. All of the espresso staples, plus some Colombian types.
I would definitely come back.</text>

After calling several local Doctors to try and be seen and no one being able to get me in for several days or weeks I decided to go to this walk in clinic. The staff was friendly and made the sign in process very easy. Once I was taken back to a room both the male nurse/tech & the female doctor were very helpful. The doctor took time to look up several medications to be sure they didn’t cause more issues with what I already had. I will definitely return if needed.< /Text>

I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a more pleasant urgent care experience. You can make appointments which makes the whole process so much smoother. The staff is friendly, waiting room is clean, and you are taken care of very quickly. I was checked in, seen by the doctor, and out the door within 30 minutes. That's unheard of!  I felt almost as if it was my own doctor's office and not just another urgent care facility. I cannot recommend this place enough. I will definitely be in again!</Text>

Nice people, short wait time and helped me.

I was coughing a lot for two days and felt like I couldn't catch my breath.  The nice women at the front desk welcomed me, and got me checked in quickly.  I was seen by the doctor and he gave me a breathing treatment and got me feeling better in 20 minutes.

I am so grateful that this Urgent Car has chosen Moorpark to be their new home.  I'll be going back, but hopefully not too soon.< /Review>

Dr Rajinder Maan is my favorite practitioner ever. Very attentive to ones needs, extremely professional, courteous and excellent bedside manners. He just happens to be on call at the urgent care in Moorpark when I came in. He is normally attending patients in Simi. I was comfortably surprised when I saw him as my urgent care Doctor. Adventist Health is definitely my choice and my recommendation to friends and family. Ask for Doctor Rajinder! You won’t be disappointed!< /Review>

I had to go there twice this week for an infected leg. I saw 2 different doctors, both highly professional and competent with good bedside manners. In fact, I could say the same for all the staff members there that I dealt with. It's my new #1 urgent care!<//review>

I scheduled online at 9AM and was sitting in front of your nurse practitioner at 10AM.
The Dr met with me shortly after.
He gave me a thorough exam and diagnosis.

Last week I needed to visit the Urgent Care Center in Moorpark and I found the customer service that I received was excellent from the greetings at the front table to the physician who examined me.
The facility is new, clean, and bright and I did not have a long wait to see the doctor.
Thank you very much for the quality of your care.< /text>

<review>I called to schedule an appointment and was advised to come right in very little wait time. When I arrived only one person waiting in the lobby. After two hours I had to leave. I  lost my patience sitting in the examination  room being told that the Doctor would be in shortly.< /review>< rate>

I ended up here on a Tuesday for a chest x-ray because of lung congestion. Then Thursday I was panting and called  urgent care on phone and actual doctor got on the phone with me and urged me to go to ER “just in case you might have an embolism.“ The comment from this doctor probably saved my life  as I did have an embolism on CT scan at hospital.

The facility is very large and clean, even the assistants  and secretaries were kind and friendly. Next time I need an urgent care I will go here!!</Text>

The staff of 12 year olds were very rude. My sister wanted yogurt mill, and I suggested this establishment instead. Was a huge mistake. The girls were all sitting down when we walked in. Didn’t bother to greet us. Kept rolling their eyes when we asked questions. I’ve worked in customer service for years now and this is not how you treat customers. We were seated for a few minutes and a couple women walked in. I’m assuming they knew the workers because the customer service they received was night and day compared to what we received.< /text>

<text>This is my favorite locally owned business in Ceres!!! They offer frozen yogurt, sno cones, and many delicious hot and cold drink creations. Various seating options are available inside the establishment, and they have a drive thru! There's also handicap parking available in front of their location. Support small businesses all year because every day can be small business Saturday.< /text><Name>Pumped Up</Name><Time>1562273184451<//Time><Gmap_id>0x8091ab2c8c45123d:0xa8ac8722b61e786a<//Gmap_id>< pics>

Our first time there will be our last.  The female at the cash register was rude. I asked her how much would our yogurts be and she said she didn't know,  she just works there.  And continued to stand there while the guy made our yogurts.< /Text>

Excellent service and very good food. I had a delicious salad with chicken added.  I also had a couple slices of marghuerita pizza which was great. We were a party of 3 children and 3 adults celebrating a birthday.< /text>

Nice Italian theme in the decor, which was well supported by the music and the rest of the atmosphere. My breakfast needs are pretty basic, so I can’t comment on the majority of the menu, but it seem unique and inventive, compared to standard breakfast menus. Service has been great so far!</review>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I visit plenty of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very chummy and the cuisine they serve is so good. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner here. I highly recommend this place.<//text>

Good place to go.. The wines are delicious. My main item i loved was the folded gelato... Even though I am extremely lactose intolerant I would eat that over again. The vegetables were my next favorite, the wine and then my cod.</Review>

Nice traditional Chinese Restaurant housed in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut. Food was very good and so was the service. I was there for lunch with some friends and everyone enjoyed their food. I can't say anything bad. I wish I lived closer and I'll definitely be back!<//text>

This place is my favorite place.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. when  I I need a proper supper, this is the place that comes straightaway to my head. splendid and varied  food and a large list of dishes.generous staff members, and great spirit. Not less important, the pay is reasonable. I sent my friends to this restaurant with great pleasure.< /Text>

<Review>Absolutely the worst service ever. McDonalds is a 5 star service compare to this one. After sitting for 30 min in an almost empty restaurant I had to go ask for waiter to come. 10 min later he showed up reluctantly took our order and asked if we wanted bread. Brought us oil and literally 10 min later bread. We been here 40 min to finally get bread. And just so you don’t think I’m picky here is the place right now

But in fairness once the food actually arrived it was really good

So the lesson is - if you are in a hurry this isn’t a place for you, but if you have a few hours to spare and you want good food - you found a perfect place</Review><rate>1</rate>< Name>

<Date>1551672375626< /Date><review>Located in the Weston hotel.
Waiter was helpful and gave good recommendations.  It helped make our visit to the area complete with a special meal.
The Grigliata di Pesce Misto (  grilled seafood medley) and Cappellacci di Zucca ( butternut squash pasta ravioli filled with squash and walnuts) were delicious. Flavorful and cooked perfectly meals.
We had an appetizer, a soup, two meals , a coffee , a tea and  shared a dessert for $110 + tip, Worth the price.< /review>< user>

Okay food for such a pricey place. We came here for breakfast and had the eggs Benedict and bacon omelette, and while fairly good, neither was worth the price. The interior is nice, but there's not much of a view. The service was amicable and decently quick.</review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>I preferred the dog pile over the burger. It's pricy and large so def split it. It had two patties on top of crispy fries or tater tots with their sauces. You can also ask to split your dog pile with half fries and half tots. Both are made well. They've been crisped up real nice which I always love.< /review>< pictures>

The initial experience was not great, because it took 10+ min to get waters after getting seated, and it took another 10 min before we met our waiter. Once the waiter came by the rest of the night went well. Food was good; I got the lobster spaghetti and it was very flavorful (very "sweet", pairing with the sauce, moreso than I expected). Others in my party got the salmon, chicken, and a seafood plate. The dessert tiramisu was solid also.< /review>

<review>This is a phenomenal restaurant if you are looking for good Italian cuisine. The pricing is reasonable in comparison to other restaurants in the bay area. The atmosphere is very "high society" and the service is great. Perfect place for a dinner date or lunch with co-workers. Truly one of San Jose's hidden gems.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Great Italian, good wine selection. Portion size is large... You won't go hungry here. The food is very flavorful and colorful, with a lovely presentation. Casual atmosphere, with good sized tables. Only complaint is the chairs are not comfortable. Highly recommend it.<//Review>

Classic Italian cuisine with great service.  Was here for a work banquet and was not disappointed.  Chicken and fish dishes were outstanding and the banquet room well staffed.  Definitely recommend if in downtown San Jose.<//Review>

Great Italian food and Amazing wine collection.
Ambiance is Nice.
The arugula salad was full of flavors.
I ate the Mushrooms Risotto and it's rare to find a place which does justice to flavors and textures of a well balanced Risotto.
I enjoyed dessert also. It was very yummy.
Overall I Like this Place.<//text>

If I could rate this zero stars, I would have no problem doing so. I had such a terrible experience here and I will most definitely not be going back. I have a severe nut allergy and I did inform the waiter, he assured me that there were no nuts in what we were ordering. Others in my party ordered a meatball appetizer, which the waiter came back almost five minutes after we had it at our table to let us know that there were pistachios in the meatballs. I’m lucky I didn’t take a bite out of the dish. They also never refilled our waters when we were there, and it took forever for them to bring us the drinks at first. The food is extremely overpriced for the serving sizes they have and the service that comes with it. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, don’t even think about coming here. Everyone, save your money and go somewhere else. 0/10 would not recommend.</Review>

<text>This is a phenomenal restaurant if you are looking for good Italian cuisine. The pricing is reasonable in comparison to other restaurants in the bay area. The atmosphere is very "high society" and the service is great. Perfect place for a dinner date or lunch with co-workers. Truly one of San Jose's hidden gems.</text>< rate>

I won’t say it’s experience but still more on fine dining side. They keep changing menu and have specials. Quite a bit wine pairing options. There bread is good, I usually don’t eat that but wasn’t able to pass on this.

Decent vegetarian options and good part is there willingness to make it work and customize.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I had a fish Stew with lots of shrimp, scallops, shell fish and something white. The soup was good but a bit too spicey. One friend ordered pizza, which was just okay and enough for two. The pasta dish was not bad. The chicken with spinach was good as well. The restaurant was a bit classy. The food was okay. The taste was normal. The waiter seemed a bit 'salty'.<//Text>

I have been to Il Fornaio for Happy Hour and have always been impressed with the quality and service. The same holds true to weekend brunch. Wonderful menu choices. Excellent service. My son said it was the BEST eggs benedict he has had, and he loves to eat out. It was a lovely choice for a delicious brunch before walking to the children's performance of the Nutcracker in downtown San Jose.<//review>

When we with my wife stop by, we would like not see sour-faced waiter, when he heard, that we are here to spend some time with cup of coffee and would like to see desserts menu only.
And I would prefer to get a cheque after I ask for it, but not when we haven't finished yet.< /Text>

Medicore Italian food. I had to send back my homemade pasta dish with a huge clump of uncooked pasta. How do you, not see that when dishing it up? Other dishes in our party were not so good either.< /Review>

Good spot for quality Italian food. Good place to catch up with friends. The staff was friendly and sociable. The bill was appropriate. Feels like a place in Los Angeles I liked.< /Text>

The spaghetti with house made meatballs was delicious, and the complimentary bread was warm and fresh. They have a limited selection of non-alcoholic drinks. It can be quite crowded, but we were seated during a busy lunch without waiting.<//review>

<text>I have been to this place twice and each time it has been a major disappointment.  I love the staff, the decor and service but the food is way over priced for mediocre taste.
I ordered a Ribeye Steak, which my butcher says is one of the best tasting meats and it was flavorless, and much to fatty.  I rather cook my own steak than have these "chefs" cook one for me.  Go for drinks but for meals keep walking!<//text>< Pics>

Loved the risotto - one of the best I have had (it wasn't on the regular menu though so not sure if it was a seasonal menu).  Service was a bit slow when we first got seated due to the packed house of concert goers.

One thing I really loved was the use of paper straws instead of plastic.<//review>

It resulted in the server always ignoring our drinks needing to be refilled. 3 people ordered lasagna at our table and another person's lasagna looked burnt on top. My serving was cold inside and medium burnt on top.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I dined there two nights in a row, as my hotel was just across the street. The dining room is nice, not too loud, considering the amount of tables set up. Their wine selection was good, but a tad expensive for selections by the glass. I thought their spinach ravioli was the better of the two meals I had. The sauce on the ravioli was good enough to dip the bread in, after I polished off all the ravioli. The bread was warm and tasty, and came with oil and vinegar. The second night, I had their free range chicken, with a (slightly) spicy sauce. The chicken was cooked very well, and the spinach side was prepared perfectly. The potatoes that came with the dish were the only low point, as they were somewhat hard and dry. Service was attentive, but just a tiny bit on the slow side one evening. Still, the waiter was friendly. I watched him go over almost the entire menu with a table of four next to me, after they just couldn't decide what to order. He was patient, and professional.</text><userid>104056637590735815636</userid></record></dataset><record>

Downtown area so parking has to be managed.  The restaurant is in the hotel and the entrance is from inside the hotel also.  Service was great and personal, food was fresh and served very well.  Place can get loud if you have a large party.  Overall a little tight on the layout.  Very friendly and accommodating to kids.< /text>

Good ambience, fantastic staff and finally a nice Risotto! I ate the Mushrooms Risotto and it's rare to find a place which does justice to flavors and textures of a well balanced Risotto. This place definitely delivered!<//Review>

<Date>1566792262342< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I took a seven year break after a couple awful service experiences at the Walnut Creek location but thought, maybe this location and after all that time, things might be better. NOPE!

They were terribly short staffed and the food was not great. The burrata salad was bland and there was no offer of balsamic. The minestrone was good but super salty. My pasta was served sloppily in a bowl with splatter all over it.

It took 15 minutes for the server to even greet us. We were literally about to walk out. Our server barely checked on us after taking our order and i had to ask for refills for the table as none of the staff noticed our empty glasses that had been on the table for quite some time.

If only there was a way to tell if the local theaters and convention center would be busy this weekend? If only there was a way to know that there were lots of things happening downtown in SJ so they could call in extra help... If only...

This isn't Olive Garden. Our expectations were higher. That was the worst $80 I've spent in a while.<//text>< pics>

Wow!  They treat you so well!! Went here on our anniversary and the manager greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary. We even received complementary sparkling wine and dessert.  They made our time very special.  A special thank you to our server Tristen.  He made us feel so special and welcomed and answered all our questions and gave wonderful recommendations.  We will definitely be returning with friends!< /Text>

Hostess probably worked at a fast food restaurant before coming here.  Booked a reservation for Mother’s Day, came 15 minutes, and was told table will be ready in 5 mins.  I then sat right outside with my family for 20-25 minutes, maybe 10 past my reservation time, and asked about my table.  Hostess looked behind her and said, oh, tell them to come in table is ready... she was previously standing there with 3 other coworkers just chatting.

When we walked up to the table, my chair was wet, so the same hostess said she would help clean it.  She grabbed a towel and just glide over the chair, leaving it still wet and actually sticky.  I walked back up to her to suggest a new chair or be moved to a different table.  She then came back over, grabbed our menus, and put it on a different table without any words said.

Besides the worst hostess in any restaurant I’ve been to, my entree came out room temperature warm.  Is this even expected?  Didn’t want to ruin Mother’s Day so I just kept quiet.  This will be the last time I go back and will make sure never to recommend this place.

Thanks for nothing.  Please give the hostess a warm warning to do a better job<//Text>

This place sees a lot of traffic and it would be easy for the staff and kitchen to fall into a routine of turning tables and spinning plates. Cece isn’t doing that at all. We took a table in the bar tonight and — despite being slammed — Cece gave us personal recommendations and lit us up with a warm smile while everyone else was frantically running about. Best meal we had in San Jose this trip.<//Review>

<Review>My coworker's and I had lunch at Il Fornaio since we were at a Conference.  We all ordered salads. Nothing special about them and  my chicken was overcooked and dry. Service was just OK. I remember when this place was really great. A lot of competition in the area. I suggest management to review top to bottom and step it up. The bus boy, man, was great. Our server, not so much.<//Review>< Pics>

My girlfriend and I went there for our 1 year anniversary because we wanted to splurge a little. Side note: And also because we're boycotting Olive Garden for supporting Trump's reelection.

First, the service was great. All of the servers were aware of our needs and were filling up our waters almost every time they walked by. Second, the dinner was absolutely DELICIOUS and SIMPLE.

My girlfriend got the gnocchi al pesto and the pesto, you can tell, is homemade and absolutely delicious with blasts of flavor. Plus the gnocchi was incredibly soft, it complemented everything so well. I received the penne with the vodka sauce without bacon because we're vegetarian and OH MY WORD, that pasta dish was made with so much jam packed flavor. The sauce was absolutely amazing. Overall these two dishes tasted incredibly authentic and the portions were absolutely perfect and worth the price.

The dessert was probably the biggest surprise of the night. We opted out for the almond chocolate cake and salted caramel gelato with raspberry sauce. WOW. That's all I have to say.

You can truly tell this restaurant cares about being authentic and utilizing fresh ingredients that have incredible flavor. Will definitely be coming back for another special occasion and I highly recommend supporting this local place if you live in the Downtown San Jose area. Thank you for having us and being LGBTQ+ friendly!</Review>

Efficient and friendly service. I recommend ordering and sharing an appetizer, salad, and a main course. Salmon is farmed but good. Finish the meal with sorbet and grappa.</Text>

< review>
I had a thin crust pizza called fradiavola which was sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onions covered with a spicy oil. Very delicious! Kind of spicy but I like my pizza like that.my daughter had the Conchigli al pollo. She liked it a lot. Juicy chicken with pasta, broccoli and garlic cloves.My sis had the Insalata Di pollo dal Girarrosto. Basically a very nice and fancy cob salad. I will say that they use some very nice pieces fresh bacon on the salad. My wife loved it!<//review>

Our waitress was super nice and really accommodating. Excellent service aside, I thought of the food wasn't exceptional especially given the hotel pricing. I didn't have a bad time but I wouldn't to go back and I wouldn't recommend it.< /Text>

This restaurant is pretty great but don't expect top leave with your wallet.   The arugula salad was full of flavors.   I did add Salmon and unfortunately it was overcooked.   I will probably reserve this place when on a work trip...< /text>

Huge portion, made reservations and showed up earlier and they were able to serve us. Quick service, delicious bread, I was only vegan and asked to make a simple pesto and capalini yet waiter didn't seem to be bothered with the request, he actually seemed irritated the entire time yet the rest of the staff was friendly.< /Text>

Tucked away in the same building as the SanJose Hyatt, you will find an Italian menu, but over - priced, with decent portions. Personally, I think they're trying too hard. Their Caesar dressing was far too fishy and lemony, the risotto adequate, and the penne with vodka sauce was drowning with bacon. The bread was very tasty.<//Review>

<review>It's a quite fancy restaurant with good decor and ambience. The people who work there seemed to behave as if they know of such a situation. We went twice thIs particular week as it was close and for the guests. However, the experience during the two visits last week was less than satisfactory.

Perhaps, it was too busy. But, it was difficult to get attention. Upon getting the attention and asking for a few things, it took several minutes to respond making what were requested more or less meaningless for the meal.

One of the guest's meal was subpar where the parts of the spaghetti pasta were clumped and thus undercooked, causing some efforts to avoid those portions. In fact, my fish/salmon was undercooked in retrospect, which I thought at the time was intentional. Anyway, the guest was gracious enough to not cause issues with the pasta and thus found out only toward the end of the meal. We considered bringing this to the attendant but decided not to due to the earlier slow and somewhat ignorant responses and we didn't want to be late to the next event.

Lastly, about the food... It is okay but really it's missing something as the food tends to be blend and doesn't really bring out the exclamatory wows. I should have voiced objection when this was picked bringing up how I got sick (once each at the San Jose and Santa Clara restaurant) after eating at Il Fornaio previously. I am glad that I didn't get sick after eating the undercooked salmon.

Italian cuisine is one of my favorite. But, it's been less than average experience here at Il Fornaio unfortunately, especially when one considers the price...

I considered 1 star rating... The second star is for the decor and ambience...</review>< pictures>

The appetizers were good as was the risotto. The salad needed some TLC, and the main and the cannelloni was an embarrassment. the potatoes that were served with both the sea bass and the salmon were so rubbery im sure they would bounce if they hit the floor. The fish was dry and the veggies bland. I would have been upset if I got this quality of good at a Denny's.  Maybe there having an off day but i won't be back to give them a send shot nor any of the members of the party I was with.< /text>

<text>Came here for my parents' 30th anniversary lunch. We decided to come to the lower-reviewed San Jose location because it is closer to us and to avoid the lunch rush in Santa Clara.

I have to say that the reviews are right; service was pretty underwhelming. Our server was pretty aloof, and I never caught his name. He seemed a little annoyed about our questions about the menu. He never checked in with us after the food arrived, and we spent about half of our eating time trying to locate him to get our glasses refilled and order a drink. We felt like we were interrupting him. What for the food was also pretty long, but that doesn't usually bother us. Has some nice date night ambience, but it was kind of spoiled by the service.

The food was solid. We have had Il Fornaio catering that has blown us away, and this didn't do that. With the exception of the bruschetta, which was excellent. Petto di Pollo a la Peperonccini - essentially a grilled chicken with a spicy sauce and a kind of boring salad. Ravioli - Good! The sauce was very fresh tasting with a bit of bit. Lasagña - good, but very rich. Very soft and sauce-like.

So... probably worth it to go to Santa Clara for the better service. Also, parking validation for Convention Center parking only, just fyi.<//text><user_id>113632914739697554993<//user_id>< Rating>

Might be good on a normal visit, but we went for Thanksgiving dinner and were mostly ignored by the staff, then served a few cold, rubbery slices of turkey, unseasoned green beans, and sweet potato slices so hard that I couldn't get my fork into them. The pumpkin pie was good, at least, but yeah, I won't be eating there again.<//Review>

Pasta was pretty good; salad wasn't anything special but was fresh. Service was real slow, only had the one drink over 2+ hours.  Had to ask for water multiple times.  If you're on a tight schedule, this would be a bad choice.</Text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>The Olive bread was very good.  After that everything went downhill.  The Caesar salad was not fresh and had some brown pieces in it.  The cheese was a very salty batch that they probably got a discount on.  The pizza I order was supposed to be a Margarita Pizza and it wasn't even close.  That is a pizza that is supposed to have the three colors of the Italian flag with fresh slices of tomato, mozzarella and fresh basil.  I got a cheese pizza with two little pieces of basil.  It was salty and hands down the worst pizza I have ever had.  The average Italian would think we are idiots for eating such low quality dishes at a sky high price.

I also tried other dishes from family with me.  The salmon was the cheap Costco farm salmon and was dry.  The scallops were over cooked. Ravioli was something bad.  The lamb shank had far too much salt on it and was the best dish at the table.

What a huge disappointment the restaurant was.  They need to fire the chef.  I give it two stars, because the olive bread was good.<//Review><resp>None</resp>< user_name>

This place has the rudest staff ive ever came across. I came in with my wife to pick up a to go order and when I first got here I went to the reception desk by the front door and I asked the lady with glasses kindly "where would I be able to pick up my order?" And she rudely answered "at the bar" while she waved her hand like I was some dog she was trying to shoo away. So then I get to the bar and I stood there for approximately 5-7 minutes before I took it upon myself to ask where I could pick up my order. The bartender was a older lady with short hair who had looked me in the eye multiple times and never acknowledged to help me. I received my order and left. This place is know for good food but also know for rude and slow service unfortunately. I will never go to this place again and take my business somewhere else.<//Text>

The food was really great, but what was really disappointung was the service, it was really long to be served, and this until the bill. It takes 2 hours and we were only 2...only 1 waiter was there, and all the other employees were only preparing other tables.< /review>

This is one of our most favorite restaurants with tasty meals, attentive staff, and wonderful service. For affordable eating out, enjoy their Happy Hour (4-6pm M-F) menu. If you want something more, try their Festa menu offered 2 weeks each month (check for exact dates) featuring cuisine from different regions of Italy. Their regular menu is always excellent as well.< /Review>

This place barely gets a four-star rating. Overpriced, the food is good. The thing about my last visit was the waiter made me feel like I was bothering him. And a bit snooty when my friends stated she didn't care for the drink. By the way, they still charge us for the cocktail. I'm in the fast food restaurants. Comp more than they felt was necessary. I've been on the pathetic side still, it's solid Italian food.<//Text>

Convenient to California Theater for symphony. Based on the price I would have expected better service (had to ask for refills on water, iced tea and coffee) and properly prepared food (potatoes under cooked and veal over cooked and tough).</text>

Was in town for a conference and stayed in the hotel this restaurant is located in so we wound up visiting here 3 times. When we showed up in the evening the first night for drinks we barely got any service. When we had a reserved room for a large dinner party we got impeccable service. When we ate here out of exhaustion on our last night, we got mediocre service. The food was alright but very expensive.</Review>

Excellent Italian food served by slightly harried waiters in a comfortable setting. We both chose appetizers and an entree.

My wife had a seafood sampler from the regular menu - it was exceptional with squid, tuna, scallops, and shrimp. There was a light sauce that enhanced, not overpowered, the seafood. I chose the Jota alla Triestina (borlotti bean soup) from their Friuli menu and it was an exceptional rustic soup, hearty but not rich.

We both ordered entrees from the Friuli menu. The Risotto Miramare was excellent with perfect risotto and seafood (shrimp, calamari, crab) in every bite. Balanced with peas and tomatoes it was a fantastic meal. The Gamberoni alla Busara was amazing - prawns larger than some lobster tails sauteed in paprika, garlic, brandy, capers, marinara and cream.

After our food we didn't have dessert because we were full. But I'm excited to check back for their regional specialties coming up.<//Text>

< review>
solid and dependable.  it’s a chain so you can basically go anywhere and get the same consistency.  plus it has been around for a long time so there’s that.

service was slow on the saturday before christmas but to be expected.  no real issues there but just be advised.

location is in the westin san jose downtown (formerly the saint claire).  parking in the area kinda sucks.  street meters max out at an hour and there is public lot across the street but at $6/hour and a $22 max it’s really not a bargain.  valet at the hotel is $15 for the first two hours with validation or $30 after that.  so factor that in.  dinging a star because of this.

food was solid if not remarkable.  parents had the tagliatelle and the linguine mare and i had the ravioli.  it’s tasty but not amazing (sorry, i got spoiled living in NYC for nine years).

worth a visit if in downtown SJ, mostly because italian here in general is very meh.  this is better than most and the decor is great.</review>

Terrible service. The staff and our waiter specifically could care less about you or the food or your experience there. One star was for the food which was ok but they still got the order wrong. Had to ask the guy several times for water, which finally came half way through our meal. He didn't check up on us until we had virtually finished lunch, and all he said was "thanks" while walking away and dropping off the check to us. I'd understand if it was really busy but he had three tables including us. I've had better service from Del Taco.< /Text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>I've been dining at this restuarant (at this location) for nearly 20 years and the food is always good.  I wish I could say that about the service.  Lately, meaning for the last 1-2 years, service has been slow.  Slow to ask for drinks, slow to take food orders, slow to serve the food.

I like the food (angel hair, risotto, calamari, desserts, etc..), and it's one of my favorite Italian restaurants, but I hope the service improves.

We stopped in here before a show downtown. The ambiance was ok, it was around 6pm and the afternoon sun was blazing thru the windows making it pretty warm in there. I had the Tagletell bolognese and my husband had the veal. Both were good sized portions. My pasta was great. It was toothsome and perfectly al dente. The bolognese sauce was quite tasty. My husband's veal however, not so good. The sauce was lemony and bright but the veal was tough and the thin coating of flour that should have been crispy was kinda gummy. The vegetable side was a giant broccoli stem and carrot that were undercooked. The food came out fast, which was nice since we were eating pre- show, but we had to ask several times for bread (it finally came to our table after our food arrived), and our waters were never refilled. The place was fairly busy but it was a Wednesday evening at 6pm. Overall I would say this place is ok if you get pasta, but they really need to improve their service.</text>

Quality in a service or product is not what you put into it.
It is what the client or customer gets out of it thats how you feel when you come here  awesome place and the best food you'll get Downtown San jose. Kenneth johns Management is the best Great guy great staff. Shout out  to Juan Cardona gives you the best treatment< /review>

<text>After 50 years' dining at IL Fornaio, in the past 2 years the prices have increased and the quality decreased. Our recent meal had only one outstanding entree out of four, mediocre bread, and half of our coffee was served in the saucer. We miss the Spiedo  chicken and the Regional Italian specials.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>The restaurant is a really big space inside a hotel so it may not be as easy to get to. We went on a lazy Sunday afternoon so there were very few guests. The service staff was small for the big space so they had to walk around a lot, making the service slow but I don't blame them, especially since they have a nice row of window seats facing the VTA train outside. The bread they served before the meal was cold, and not nice to eat, but an old waiter came around to give us olive oil and vinegar which was nice. I ordered a chicken pasta and it was actually quite delicious. I ordered it as Secondi (a smaller portion) and it came out perfectly sized, just enough for me. You may want a Primi portion if you are hungry.<//text><rate>4< /rate>< pictures>

<Review>Okay food, but too big of portions and strangely low quality of service for the fancy atmosphere and the price you pay. Bloody marys were not impressive.</Review>< time>

Ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka-Primi Portion(small) through door dash for $14.50 and was extremely disappointed at the portion size I received. Additionally, no utensils were provided making it inconvenient. The flavor was alright (a little more bacon than traditional vodka)  but again for close to $15 I would have expected more... I would not recommend.</Text>

< Review>
House made pastas are solid, excellent desserts, good coffee, I'll be back without question.  Butternut ravioli was excellent, veal & artichoke was decent, solid Tiramisu, great vanilla ice cream with espresso. Wines by the glass are worth a look after I tried the Chianti Classico for $8 I'd be willing to try others. Come during the week for the 430pm Happy hour prices for $3 beer and $5 wine by the glass.</Review>

We had dinner at Il Fornaio on Friday evening and it was a disappointing dining experience.
The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived, but it took the front door a while to seat us.   It then took our server a while to take our drink order, and by then we were ready to order our entrees.
Bread came warm to the table, which was one of the highlights of the meal.  My cannellini bean soup was the other highlight - rich, hearty, and flavorful.
3 out of the 4 entrees were less than expected - the meat in my bolognese sauce was very dry.  My friend got the grilled salmon (on the specials menu) and it was overcooked.  The spinach that came with it looked like it was previously frozen - it was gray and wilted.  My husband got the rigatoni with the vodka cream sauce and it was just meh.  The dishes lacked presentation and flavor, and several items were overcooked.
Service was cordial but on the slower side.
I don't think we'll return to Il Fornaio any time soon.<//text>

is this italian food? or is this olive garden? im not sure. pastas over cooked. causes watery and improperly seasoned. prices are too much for the quality food that was served. luckily a vendor paid for the meal or i and my wallet would have went home crying. also an empty restaurant kind of is a telling sign. then again maybe it was a normal tuesday night.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Il Fornaio is a cut above the rest. They have amazing food, great decor, and always make you feel like royalty. I love coming here every month for their Festa Regionale - where they pick a region of Italy, and their amazing chefs create a menu that reflects the flavors and culture of that region. The tasting menu is $31 and includes 3 courses. I go every month and have yet to be disappointed. I highly recommend this place!! On their regular menu, I'd suggest the Pennoni Alla Vodka or any of their Ravioli dishes.< /Text>< Pics>

food was ok, not great; service was mediocre, generally fairly slow; whole restaurant was far too warm and somehow they couldn't figure out how to adjust; wine was served (and therefore stored) at (warm) room temperature. Generally, the restaurant felt old fashioned / tired.
would not go back.< /Review>

<text>I come to Il Fornaio a few times a year. Each time I am blown away by the service and quality of food. Kenneth Johns is an exceptional manager- the establishment is always clean- and our server Ihab did a fantastic job taking care of us.  I strongly recommend the Filet Mignon cooked rare or the Cannoli Al Forno which comes on a sizzling plate.  I've also been here for breakfast, and can say without a doubt that is the best breakfast anywhere nearby.  Take my word for it, I review many places around the world, Il Fornaio will always hold a place in my heart.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The quality seems to have lowered since the last time I went here (last year).

My favorite was normally their molten lava cake but its no longer a lava cake.< /Text>

<Text>Good food and service. It's an Italian restaurant so you'll spend a lot of time here. It's not a quick in and out dining experience but it's worth it.</Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Italian correct for a quick meal. The food was good, we had a salad, some calamari and pasta. The price a bit excessive. I also found it a bit noisy. Good attention from the waitress.

(Original)
Italiano correcto para una comida rápida. La comida estaba buena, tomamos una ensalada, unos calamares y pasta. El precio un tanto excesivo. También me resultó un poco ruidoso. Buena atención por parte de la camarera.< /review>
