Best store in town! From comics, to cards, to games, odds are you'll find the perfect gift, or the perfect new hobby for yourself. Zak is a blessing to this community, and Grass Valley Games is the place I've been dreaming of since I was a little kid!<//text>

We were given a gift certificate to GV Games for the holidays and our experience of selecting the right games for our family was everything you'd want from a small business-- personable, informative, friendly and personalized.  Can't wait to have hours of fun, thanks for the help.<//review>

<text>My son and I had checked multiple stores, and this was the one we should have started with! Not only did they have what we were after, but the friendly clerk explained the shortage and helped us browse the other merchandise until we found the perfect fit for something for my husband, too. So kind, helpful, and a good selection of supplies. Love this store!<//text>< pictures>

<review>The owner was very rude and inappropriate when I was trying to shop.
Not only was he rude to me, the phone conversations that he was having were rude and made me very uneasy.
The owner is a liar and a thief.
I do not recommend shopping here.</review><gmap_id>0x809b703c09db6e75:0xccb85f2e73ca3809< /gmap_id><username>Hailey Vaughan< /username>< rating>

{'time': 1621207432797, 'text': "So.....I'm not sure what to say as the owner. This seems very felonious and false. What day did this supposedly take place on. Could you explain the rude and inappropriate. Did I ask you to wear a mask. Please explain because without further info I will have this removed as calling me a liar and a thief is grounds for legal action against you if you do not have any proof of evidence. You obviously didn't pay attention when litigation was happening a few years back and is still happening its called slander and the value of these suits is determined by how many people may have seen review and you just posted on Google so put up your evidence, delete the false review, or expect to here from my lawyer Balcom and associates within the next few weeks. He's on retainer I might as well use him."}< /Resp>

Very friendly & welcoming place. Nicely maintained & well organized. Educated service without talking down to you or overloading you with too much info. Good layout for gaming that doesn't inhibit retail shopping even in such a small space. Lots of events and tournaments. We look forward to getting to know this place & it's culture better. A nice place to for all ages. Best spot of its kind we have been to thus far. Definitely would recommend.</review>

Finally have a good hobby shop in town once again, board games, comics, miniatures and card games. Helpful, friendly and a good environment for casual collectors or serious investors.< /Review>

Quick friendly service. Called ahead to make sure there wasn't multiple people waiting ahead of me. Received paperwork pertaining to the Smog check that had a little more in-depth information on it than where I would go in the past, not sure if its a new thing the DMV is doing or if its just this place but it was awesome to have for my records.</Text>

I came here to smog my truck. I had told the gentleman an issue I had with the catalytic converter. Long story short he helped me out, going out of his way looking up some information and printing out paperwork that I would need to solve my problem. Just appreciate his help and definitely I will return to smog all my vehicles.<//review>

For a test-only place, Eddie sure is busy! Be sure to call and make an appointment before you head over and it'll save you a ton of waiting time if you accidently come during peak hours. Parking is limited, but pull up to the back, let them know you're here, and they'll take care of the rest.< /text>

<name>Cheryl Smiley<//name><Time>1619408074587</Time><rate>5< /rate><Review>Was referred here by my mechanic for my older car needing "special" equipment to test it. I came no appointment at end of day Eddie promptly acknowledged me while on another vehicle. All in all I was in, out and to my surprise the car passed with flying colors, all in under 30 minutes at about the same price I pay for our newer cars.

We are now repeat customers and telling our family and friends about friendly Eddie's professional and courteous service.

2021. Eddie is still our go-to smog guy. Still have the old car and our truck that we bring here every time. It's like family here, respect freely given. Thanks Eddie!<//Review>< pics>

At length:At first I walked in and I couldn't find anyone, the place looks like it's falling apart, and I wasn't sure what to think... Then I talked to Eddie and he was super friendly, and told me he'd be done with the guy in front of me in a few minutes. I was talking to the guy who's car he was working on, and he had an old Mercedes that "failed a bunch of smog tests" and he said that "the other place wanted to charge me 300$ to fix it". Turns out it was just a timing problem that the people next door fixed for a couple bucks. He started on my car and it took less than 12 minutes. He was running around to get us in and out quickly. It was 20 dollars cheaper than anyone else in Fullerton with better service. Overall it was a great experience with honest service. Go here for your next smog.</review>< pictures>

I arrived to the location and Eddie immediately acknowledges me with courtesy and respect. Even though he had cars in front of me his Customer Service was outstanding. The Smog Test was conducted fast and accurate which helped me since I was in lunch from work. I really highly recommend this location for any type of Smog Test. Thank you Eddie.</review>

Eddie and Tom were right on top of things just as the previous reviews stated. After passing the Smog Test I went right next door to Richards Automotive for a very reasonably priced Oil Change. A great place for both services which were all completed in much less than an hour!  I am very satisfied.<//review>

<Text>Great guy, I googled smog checks and the first one closest to me had a five star rating, so I went there and the technician asked how I heard of him. I told him I googled and you were the first one to pop up and had 5 stars review I showed him and he was amazed, thanked me and gave me a $20 discount and out the door in Ten minutes........Awesome business<//Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Quick, efficient, friendly service. I was in the early afternoon and got their smog appointment ... really nice and friendly owner Mr. Eddie and they made the whole process extremely easy and fast.
Good price, kind and honest service ... It is only in the shopping mall like other repair shops .... It is hard to see if you see signboards. ... thank you mr.Eddie

Absolutely delicious sushi!! The AYCE option is the way to go. All the sushi and apps tasted so fresh. This is a top tier restaurant. We were seated right away & the staff was excellent, very nice and attentive. The kitchen had our food out in no time! This joint is a MUST TRY.</text>

I love this spot! They give superb dishes, their menu is large, The chief cook in that spot is an expert, I like very much tasting all their food. The food is consistently tasty, the attitude towards the customers  is friendly. I frequently visit this place and I was never disappointed. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Really great place for sushi. They have the AYCE Sushi down pat. Everything is fresh and comes out in a very timely matter. The staff is really great and attentive. They don't brush you off, or act and in a standoffish manner when you ask for something. Keep up the great work!< /text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Heard and read great reviews about this place but the experience was awful. We had the biggest table and it wasn't packed. I had to flag down a waitress to serve us water because it was 13 min and still no services since they sat us.  Food wasn't that good had better at a cheaper place which is sad to say. We all ordered all you can eat and didn't get to do all you can eat cause it took forever to get our order. Oh she serve sushi last after the rolls if they remember.  I love sushi but I don't recommend this place to anyone.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d52b32457495:0x593551074a40a4bb</gmapID></record>

Wide variety of food and all ingredients are very fresh.

Unfortunately, there was a big cockroach appeared on our booth seat when we were having dinner, and surely affected our appetite a lot. I’d suggest to improve more on hygiene part for the environment in order to provide customers more pleasant experience.

You can order separately or go for All-You-Can-Eat.

The price for All-You-Can-Eat:
M-F Lunch $21.95
M-F Dinner $25.95
Sat & Sun All Day $25.95
(Beverages excluded)< /review>

< Review>
This place is awesome. The fish is always fresh, the beer is always cold, the tea is always hot, and the staff is always welcoming. If you don't want sushi you can get other types of Japanese food as well. But don't ask me what's on the non sushi menu, because I haven't even looked at it.</Review>

Lunch price was great around $25pp even on weekends. The rice are so tiny under the fish so it’s basically sashimi which is uncommon in all other AYCE places. When we went they gave us a plate of chef special sashimi which was a great surprise!! (Pic3)<//Review>< rating>

<Review>I call this unique restaurant every couple of days since I love the  special atmosphere that is outline this restaurant. The crew is extremely attentive and well trained. The service is awfully quick. Needless to say, the food you get is good. I have been there many times and I was never disappointed. The rate is modest. I suggest this restaurant to all my friends.< /Review>< Time>

We arrived there on Wednesday around 530.  When it comes to food, no customers always seems like a bad sign... And there was no other customer in the shop. Well, shortly after we sat, several other groups began to show up. We ordered a bunch of tuna and salmon sushi. 6 other rolls (with and without rice). Everything was good. Spicy tuna seemed to dominate everything we ordered. Which really wasn't bad if that's what you like. Good food. Good service. Good prices. 4 star all the way!< /Text>

Sushi was warm, and the restaurant too. Didn't turn the AC on until they overheard us talking about it and when I say overheard....I mean ease dropping. Lady there uncomfortably stands close and stares at your table. Would not recommend this place or go back.</text>

<Text>Great food and very good value. The rolls are delicious and the all-you-can-eat has amazing choice. I found the staff particularly thoughtful and knowledgable and they worked well as a team. The only reason I'm not going for a 5 is that the tables and floors and bathroom had this sticky film. Like it had been a fried chicken place before they bought it and the film of grease is still there. If that bugs you it's not for you but if you want 5+ star sushi and service, GO!</Text>< Pics>

Make no mistake, this isn't the type of place to just toss vegetables in a sushi roll and call it a day. They actually make an effort to create delicious rolls that taste very similar to the real thing, and if not the real thing, they taste amazing as their own creations. The only thing I wish was that there was a bigger selection, but it's hard to come by a vegan sushi place in the first place, and Meiga does it right.</text>< Pics>

My 3rd time for all you can eat the portions were very small and the waitress took my order sheet away after only ordering what I would say a average at best amount of sushi. Then brought me my bill and charged me the $30.00 all you can eat price and said thanks for coming in. I am not sure about  you, but all you can eat means that you eat all you want lol!</text>< Pictures>

We love Meiga Sushi!  A good deal for all you can eat. Sushi is good quality. The manager and employees ensure you have a good time.  This is a good place to go for family birthday, etc celebrations.<//Review>

Always my go to sushi place in La Habra/Whittier. The fish is fresh and they are not skimpy on the size of fish pieces. The ice cream is good and the staff is very friendly and attentive!</text>

I've been a repeat customer of this joint about four times in the last two months.  Naturally, I have a few things to say.  First, one would think that the "all you can eat" would impact the quality of the individual servings.  One would be quite wrong. The quality of food is excellent.  I order a mix of nigiri and rolls.  You cannot hide bad fish on nigiri, and this fish is definitely fresh.   Also, the rolls are pretty big, and there are a large variety to shoose from.  Second, not only is the price super reasonable for sushi, but I really worry that it's too low to sustainably operate a business.  Lastly, a lot of the seating is made of super high booths.  The rest is normal casual fair.  Those booths are an excellent place to bring your friends and just hang out.  Isolated with great food.  I will definitely be returning.<//Text>

be prepared to take naps between rounds cuz it takes approx. 43 minutes for anything to come out.
owner needs to utilize employees better especially the sushi chefs who take 6 seconds to make a single salmon sushi.</text>

The service here is great and the food is delicious. When I've asked for recommendations from the staff they give me great picks. Plus, their cold sake comes in a really cool glass and to top it all off they've got Saporro Black!< /review>

<text>Fresh fish and creative rolls. AYCE is a great value. Nigiri preparation is pretty basic, don't expect anything fancy. Chef will occasionally treat with free special morsel. This is a solid choice for a big sushi meal with friends, family or even solo.</text>< Pictures>

Holy guacamole, why didn't I know about this place sooner? I would be a regular here weekly if I didn't move to Oregon!! The prices are unbeatable, the staff is ultra friendly, the fish quality is above satisfactory! Fish to rice ratio is out of this world.Talk about fast sushi, quick service and without sacrificing flavor . This place has an abundance of positive vibes, creative spark and a great place for a date, a reunion between friends, hell even a funeral here would have a great time. keep doing your magic, My Meiga!!!<//text>

<text>If you close at 9:30 it does not mean you push out your clients before 9:30 so you can be out at 9:30. It means you close the doors at 9:30. If you want to go home at 9:30 then close the restaurant earlier. Last night my friend and I went there and before 9:30 our waitress kept on standing by our table asking if everything was fine. It didn't feel like great customer service it felt like we were getting kicked out. We come to this place at least once a week and it really was sad we couldn't even finish our sushi in peace. You need to take care of your regulars. The sushi is great but nobody likes to be rushed out.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d52b32457495:0x593551074a40a4bb<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Service was great and relitivly cheap all you can eat sushi. All you can eat is full rolls and not heavy on rice like some places. They also have flavored sake which is delicious. I would recomend for birthday dinners to, they so some special stuff and make it a big deal.</Text>

<Review>The food is absolutely exquisite. I my self am not a fan of seafood but this place is really growing on me. Staff welcomes you like traditional sushi resturants do. There are plenty of seats but it gets so busy sometimes you nees to wait. The all you can eat sushi is worth the price- you get a ton of good sushi. It has a very lively atmopshere, and when its slow its a good place to chill and talk with friends or family as you wait. Be patient with the sushi rollers, its worth it as they prepare your food.
They have music playing and some T.V'S on. They also have free green tea ice cream which is very refreshing after eating (and being stuffed of) delicious fish with delicate rice wrapped in crisp, fresh seaweed.

You will really love this place!</Review>< UserId.>

Staff here is amazing!  I've been to several All You Can Eat sushi restaurants and some have great food with ok service, and some have great service with ok food.  Meiga surprised us as the staff here are phenomenal.  It was a very last minute decision to check them out but I'm glad we found them!  We will be back for sure!<//review>

Chef will make sure that you leave satisfied.  No holds bar on the what you can eat for 20 bucks.  The servers are committed on making you explode, and she toppled it with green tea ice cream.  Top five 🍣 place.< /review>

The service here is really great, I've been here at least a handful of times and they were always on top of our orders. Their sashimi comes with minimal rice, which I love because I can order more sashimi to eat! Their blue fin tuna and albacore are always my go to. Also, their non-rice rolls are worth trying too!</text>

Portions are huge, the fish-to-rice ratio is amazing and prices are more than affordable!  The staff is incredibly nice and the sushi chefs pop out their beautiful creations at an incredible pace.

One thing to remember, though, is that if you go for the all-you-can-eat-buffet ($20 lunch/$25 dinner), you should expect some of the rolls to be slightly different (a bit smaller and without certain ingredients) from the same-named rolls served a la carte.</text>< pictures>

As always I choose Meiga fo the salmon. And I was not disapointed. The first round of 50 pieces were excellent. Nice thick slice, low rice ball, and the 2nd round cuts with the fatty bits, delicious. Calamari was very good for in between waits along with the shrimp tempura and beef gyoza. I still go to Vegas for gyoza, but for southern California, this is the place to meet. The salmon roe is served in small portions so you'll have to order twice what you're used to if you want a roe portion. The miso is also a good choice and what seals the deal is the fact they serve Spider hand rolls here. Another great trip to Meiga Sushi, thanks.<//Text>

< review>
Food was okay , price was normal for an all you can eat restaurant, the service was pretty bad , very slow , and took a long time to get a drink and a roll , they were too busy worrying about the atmosphere of the restaurant rather than the customers , AND they were so distracted that they gave me the wrong debit back , making me cancel mine , not so good of a place</review>

Was craving some sushi, but was too far from my favorite spots in LA. Stumbled upon Oeeshi and found great value for freah fish. I highly suggest the Aloha roll and make sure you get some Asahi!</Review>

You guys water down your shots and when i complain about it they made a big deal about it. Even after I had only sipped on the glass and had about 3/4 left of the drink in it. If I'm paying 7$ for a shot it better not be watered down. The first shot was chilled but tasted way too watered down. The second was a straight shot partly out of an almost empty bottle and partly out of a new bottle. I'm not saying your bartender watered down my drink because I watched him pour  but some one at some point poured water into that bottle< /text>

<Review>Place was very small, dj kept playing same beat. Only one dart board on, the other one was off, one pool table so makes it difficult to play anything. The crowd was young but most looked like they just rolled out of bed. If you want to really have a good time, this place is not it. If you just want to go have a drink and be super relaxed maybe this will be for you. Not my idea of a good time. We went on a Friday, maybe other days of the week are better.< /Review>< Pics>

Amazing little gem. All the bartenders are amazing and good at what they do! The owners are some of the nicest, most caring people I have ever met. The patrons have always beenin good spirits and their pool table brings some good shooters. If you're into Bloody Mary's, Frankie makes the best one you'll ever have. They also have great food. Any of their paninis are killer but I usually go with a bowl of chili and a big ole soft pretzel. Thanks guys!< /Text>

<text>I have been there 5 or 6 times now. It has been consistently a good experience. Parking can be tough, but there is a parking structure, buses, and train nearby. This bar has a lot going on. The game area includes shuffleboard, pool, and darts. Smoking out front/back, well, you'll see. :)  The full bar has taps, wine, and a menu of mixed drinks (perfect for when I came in brain dead and didn't know what I wanted). It includes some creative and some times strong, good deals. The food has always been good and range from a small inexpensive cup of chili (perfect when needing a little something to eat when hammering back a few strong drinks) to elaborate more expensive options.  The walls have many flat tv screens, some of which are playing videos that I grew up with. There is also a juke box to play your own songs from your smartphone. I met the owners and they have always treated me well. They create a friendly environment and community there. I look forward to my next visit.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I can not say enough about the food here. You would not believe how good it is in this "dive bar". Always a great crowd. Service can be slow because bartenders can be chatty but that's what makes them awesome.</text>

<Review>The new bar now called Eighth & Rail is wonderful. The new look and feel of the place is very cozy and charming. You can play pool, darts  and even shuffle board.  It has a very eclectic feel to the new place, it's very welcoming with its decor and staff. Glad to see them rebranding the place and staying ahead of the game with the recent and up and coming expansion of Old Town Newhall. Smart move Eighth & Rail!</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

<text>This place was beyond my expectations!! I sincerely admire the patience and kindness my two children experienced with all staff. I love how Dr. Yavari and the dental assistants explained everything to my children making them comfortable and putting them at ease throughout their entire visit. Overall, I strongly recommend this place to all especially if you have children since the service is amazing and the wait time to be seen is very minimal (like 10-15).</text>< pics>

<text>I have never been to the dentist my whole life and when I learned how important dental health is during pregnancy I searched for the nearest dentist covered by my insurance. Alhamdulilah, NexGen Dentistry was my first and last choice since finding them. The staff is so friendly, professional, and prompt. They truly leave a positive experience every time I come for my appointments. If you have questions they are patient and thorough in answering them. The equipment they use for x-rays and photographs are so advanced, it’s a pleasure getting dental work done.

And the fact there are two TV screens in each room makes it feel like I’m at the movies while getting fillings done. The whole staff is trustworthy. So if you need a dentist to go to, I highly recommend this one hands down :)< /text>< pics>

I have been visiting Next gen for about 2 months. From the first day I was impressed with the quality of care, professionalism, and progressiveness of the staff and facilities. It is the most modern dental office I've experienced and the equipment is state of the art. In addition, they make the effort to help you qualify whatever your insurance or budget.

I had a wonderful experience here with both of my children. My son is only a year old & he loved all the attention they gave him & I loved how they attended him. My daughter is 6 & she was terrified of coming to the dentist or to do any work in general ive gone to 4 different offices & here she loves coming here. She had fillings done under dental sedation & did such a great job! I highly recommend this office! The dentist & staff are completely AMAZING. 10/10!< /text>

Dr. Yavira is amazing!! , I'm very grateful I found her in the perfect timing. Prior to her I was going to SY health center dental, they were terrible never going back to SY. They were trying to extract one of my last molars after they had messed up themselfs on the job, and Thank you so much to Dr. Yavira she is able to help me save it through a root canal, better than to get my whole molar removed and getting a painful implant. Besides she also found couple of things I need it to get done that SY never even mention. Also she has very gentle hands. I had bad experiences in my past and that caused me to stop going to a dentist. Before last year I had not seen a dentist for 10 years due to getting hurt horrible and what made me go again when I decided  SY was to get my wisdom removed due having bad pain so fort on they treated me after wisdom tooth removal, but to get bad experiences again and i drew the line when they tried to extract my molar after they even messed up.. so I started to search for a good dentist with good reviews and came across Dr. Yavira. I called they took me in the same day and did a check up that same day and right away I new they were amazing the staff and the assistants were very kind welcoming they help you get very comfortable they provide relaxing scenery and music and also if you like to watch a movie they will provide that option cant Express how happy and thankful iam with them they truly are God sends. I will be taking my whole family here from now on.</text>

I know Dr Yavari since 2016 when she worked at Rose Dental in Escondido. Dr Yavari was the only reason my wife, my daughter and I went to Rose Dental, so we switched to NexGen Dentistry as soon as she moved there. Before visiting Dr Yavar, going to a dentist's was a nightmare for my 8 year old daughter but then it became a pleasant experience for her. For me, NexGen and Dr Yavari mean a perfect service at a very good price. The staff are also nice and professional, and I don't have to stay in the waiting room for a long time anymore. These are some of the reasons I'm willing to drive about 40 miles to take care of my teeth at NexGen Dentistry.<//review>

Before coming into this dentistry , I did some research of places that my insurance covered . When I came across “NexGen Dentistry” and saw several reviews that said how great the doctor Yavari was and that they were traveling from Oceanside to get their teeth fix (that’s about 45min drive ). That gave me the idea of how great the doctor is that the customer loyalty is that strong . I decided to check them out and I am glad I did .  Dr. Yavari is extremely professional and attentive to her patients along with the whole team . Alejandra (front desk ) always makes you feel welcomed and makes sure to greet you as you walk in . Terry , DA, amazing person that makes you feel comfortable before every procedure. Definitely check them out , you won’t regret it ! :)</review>

The office is beautiful and SO clean, with it's own room specifically for sanitization! Such a relief especially right now! I had such an amazing experience at this Dentistry :) I still get really nervous going to the dentist, but the space and Dr. Yavari's kindness definitely made that go away. You can really tell she cares about her patients. I loved it here!!
P.S. I work with kids and I know they would love it here too, especially with all the TVS and the headsets you can wear to listen & watch the movies while you're getting work done!<//Review>

This is absolutely the best dentist i've ever been to in my life! They actually care about you as a person and your individual needs. I personally needed about 20 procedures done to my mouth including two bone grafts and they took out out all my amalgam fillings and replace them with new non amalgam fillings. I had a very intensely abusive childhood mixed with bad dentistry and have a really strong physical trauma response and I can't stop shaking once I get to the office usually but I was able to receive sedation and they gave me the highest Comfort level I could possibly get and they got all the procedures I needed to get done in one session!  Alijandra is the receptionist i delt with and she was so kind and compassionate. I am able to eat food the next day and also floss the next day!....Truly amazing! I feel that every dentist office should practice this amount of compassion towards each and every one of the patients that comes to their office and I feel like this office definitely helps lead the way in that direction!</Text>

< Review>
I was very apprehensive to see a dentist during the COVID outbreak, however, after my first visit to NexGen Dentistry, I feel very confident that I found the right office and dentist. Dr. Yavari and her staff were very friendly and professional. They gave me a tour of their beautiful office especially their very modern sterilization center and they explained their protocol.
What impressed me was that they use UV light, air purifiers and the change their entire gowns after each patient.
I highly recommend this office.</Review>

I am so glad I reached out to a friend and was referred to this dental office who accept Medi-Cal insurance for children and adults because I've dealt with negative experience prior! Dr. Yavari and her staff are beyond great! They are very friendly and make you feel comfortable. Dr. Yavari always explains in detail and shows me exactly what she is going to do.

I recommend this place to everyone, especially younger children or people who don't enjoy the dentist too much haha, this clinic will take that fear away forever. I will definitely keep coming back. Once again, thank you guys so much!

Qué experiencia tan maravillosa y fantástica en NexGen Dentistry. Nunca me había sentido tan relajado y cómodo mientras me hacía la limpieza dental. Fui con mi pareja y el personal fue tan amable con los dos que incluso nos mantuvieron juntos. Recomiendo este lugar a todo el mundo, especialmente a los niños más pequeños o personas que no disfrutan demasiado del dentista jaja, esta clínica se llevará ese miedo para siempre. Definitivamente seguiré regresando. Una vez más, ¡muchas gracias chicos!<//Review><Date>1601753735164</Date></record></dataset><record>

This is a quiet quaint parlor that will treat you well. The girls who work there are friendly and very nice. Everything is cool here. I liked how she used those hands all over my backside. She's great at her job. I would highly recommended!</Text>

I’m a regular there so I have met every girl there. Every time I go there each girl always gives me 1000% quality service and knows how to keep me relaxed. I started going back once a week since they opened back up and they all still remember me. Iv had every girl there and because they girls there have done great I keep coming back. That’s the only place I will go to. I have never been disappointed. And I just might go back today since it’s my birthday. Trust me folks this place is the one to go to.< /review>

***Avoid if posible***
The massage was bad quality, I had to communicate what I needed worked on as she fumbled through.

None of the girls look as posted, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but she was far from good, and not even good from far. The lady that did a terrible job, wore an orange dress, was 5'5"-5'8", there was a lady in a pink dress, she might do a better job.

I didn't even get full time for the massage I paid for. She kept leaving my session to go to people no less than 3 times. She also did a jolting series of smacks on the back of my legs that ruined what little relaxation was there.

The woman has bad manners, a poor conversationalist, didn't even fake that she wanted to communicate to help me feel welcome, tried to pressure me for a tip before finishing the allotted time (I was planning on leaving a small tip if she hadn't started arguing with me.)

The only nice thing about about the interaction is that she didn't try to pressure me into a happy ending and the hot towel. Even the hot towel became cold and unpleasant because the room was cold. She did nothing with my hands or feet which have poor circulation and part of what I enjoy about massages is that it helps that problem. The cold room also made it hard to relax because of my hands and feet.

There are over 20 different places, don't go to this one.</review>

Don't waste your time and money all they want is your wallet... Another disappointment event I had on to 2/26/2020  I believe the Asian lady's name was Nancy. She was so rude  very unprofessional. The manager was also rude. Don't waste your time with unethical people. One of the ladies even smelled like dirty smoke , no Hygiene none whatsoever<//text>

<Review>One of the best dealerships in California. With their great customer service and friendliness they make you feel very at home. Sadly this is not the case with most high end dealerships especially in Southern California. Rusnak Porsche is really invested into long term relationships with their clients and are extremely transparent to their customers during the buying process. As a multi-time buyer from Rusnak I couldn’t recommend them more!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1628351725808, 'text': 'Connor, your recommendation and positive feedback are greatly appreciated!

My experience was amazing. My son and I came onto the lot with no expectation. We were greeted by Michael Aram and he helped me through the entire process. There was never a sense of pressure or bothered by my questions. He was extremely knowledgeable, nice and such a pleasure to learn about the brand and products. He assisted in making sure I felt the power Prosche as I test drove the suv. I met more people throughout the dealership and everyone treated us with respect, dignity and professionalism. I walked away with a luxury vehicle that I never thought I could have. I am a client for life at this dealership for giving me a truly amazing experience.< /Text>

Great dealership! Truly that kind of Porsche service you expect, you can find here. I recommend talking to Kareem for a sales associate. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. Thanks to the guys at Rusnak Porsche for such a pleasurable experience.< /text>

Everything from booking the appointment to getting the car back was a seem less effort. I was able to make an appointment on Sunday through their call center for an appointment the next day on Monday.  They accommodated me by getting me a loaner since my car would be there a while. They sent me text and video updates of my car them entire time they had it. When the car was ready, they let me know and I picked it up. The car was washed and cleaned for me.</text>

This dealership offered me BY FAR the best purchasing experience I have ever received. From the initial contact through their website to the final signature, Kareem took care of everything with professionalism and detail. Aside from being a great guy, he is also extremely attentive, honest and knowledgeable about every car they have in the lot.

This is the first time that I feel 100% comfortable purchasing a car from a dealership, and will continue to make all my future car purchases with Kareem and Rusnak Westlake Porsche.

The book and manuals of my car were not in it when it was delivered, and Kareem was nice enough to find them and send them to me through FedEx that same day! That is how deep into customer centricity they are.

Do yourself a favor and make your next purchase with them, I guarantee you will not regret it.< /Text>

I  found the perfect Porsche online and Kareem Alayoubi tirelessly answered all of my questions, checked, and rechecked the car for me until I was sure it was the right one.
Thanks also to Michael Rubin who talked me off the ledge as other customers were eyeing the car just as I was making arrangements to come buy it. :)
When I arrived at the dealership the car was just as expected and there were no hidden surprises.
Everything worked out in the end and I'm the proud owner of a new to me Cayman S. Thanks so much Kareem, good job!</text>

I always have my 2 Porsche's serviced by SKIP at Rusnak Porsche. He is ABSOLUTELY the best and makes it a very pleasant experience every time. Sometimes I'll just stop by to see him and mechanic Aaron ( his knowledge of engines is mind blowing) and check out the new inventory. Also, Oscar in parts is exceptional also. He once drove me the correct filter for my 911 after I purchased the incorrect one. THAT IS SERVICE!!
I'm happy to be part of the Rusnak Porsche family.<//review>

<Text>The service experience at Rusnak Porsche was outstanding. I phoned to set up an oil change and they squeezed me in the next day. I needed a loaner car which was provided. My prior service was in the San Francisco Bay area so they did not have the previous service records. However their evaluation of the status of required additional service issues matched precisely the information provided at my prior service in San Francisco.

Recently purchased a 2014 911 in Northern California  and drove down to Rusnak to purchase an Ext. Warranty.  No one in my area would offer such a great deal that Greg gave me.  It was worth the drive for the savings.

Skip was the service advisor that I had and did a great job during my visit, while short, it was still great service.<//Text>

<text>Exceptional attention and service from Eric Blackmer. He is so easy and pleasant to work with...very professional, high attention to detail, very patient and helpful with my finicky little details. He is everything you could want in a service advisor, and brings none of the much too common "untrustworthy advisor" that I have seen with other brands and advisors elsewhare. If you don't have a dedicated service person for your "Porsche baby," I would strongly suggest starting here. He is as good as it gets, and one of the very brightest spots of this dealership. Thank you, Eric. You do deserve these words and thanks for being so thorough and professional. I have rarely been so happy with anyone in the car world...Stephen C and Linda H.< /text>< Pictures>

I called to see if the car was still available, lucky for me it was and the sales person that answer the phone was very professional, he shows the love for the Porsche and he knows a lot about them, I felt very comfortable and trusted him since the begining. When We got there Mark was ready to show us the car, he took the time to  explain everything about the car and helped us understand all the steps to close the deal. I know the Porsche company is behind the great car but havinga good salesman was very good point to be more convinced about buying it immediately. Thank you, I highly recommend them.</review>

My car was everything Rusnac said it was in the ad. The paperwork went very quickly and the sales person explained most of the cars operation. When I inspected the car I found the left rear mud flap was damaged. I took the car and Rusnak sent me a new flap in a couple of days. No problem. My drive home to the central coast was amazing. Best car I have ever been in, never mind own.

I would buy from them again</review>

< Review>
Just came back from a test drive. Had a pathetic experience with Kareem, who seemed disinterested in selling the car. Guess he was judging the book by its cover or something. Porche has been a dream car for me and was seriously considering buying it but was constantly asked if we were serious about buying the car etc. Well if thats how you get treated for being a potential customer, I guess I idolized the wrong brand all these years. Your loss.<//Review>

Marty did a great job helping me, letting me know when the car was ready to come see, scheduling a test drive, and then getting all of the paperwork done and handing over the keys. The financing was approved in 15 minutes. Everyone at the dealership was very accommodating as I just had shoulder surgery and my arm was in a sling. I was impressed by the thoroughness they went over the car with, even measuring the paint thickness on each panel. I highly recommend them!  10/10.< /Review>

My Porsche required service, including reprogramming the PCM. An unexpected problem with the ODBC port complicated matters. Rusnak Porsche resolved everything and Erik, my Service rep, did a great job of keeping me updated as they worked through the unexpected problem. I really appreciated the high level of communication.

<Review>The service staff are excellent at Rusnak Porsche. Steve Ellis helped me with my most recent service. Steve is professional, knows the details and doesn’t bother you with the details unless you want or need to know.
Owning a Porsche is much more enjoyable when the dealership staff are professional, smart and friendly to work with.

<Review>Always a pleasure going to Rusnak Porsche for purchasing a new car or service. This recent trip was for servicing my 911 that I picked up in Germany. Rusnak has arranged European delivery twice for me. Michael Rubin made the experience fast and easy. Their service team is outstanding. Steve Ellis has been my advisor for years. I also got the chance to speak with Sam the mechanic that worked on my car. Greatly appreciated.  Thank you, Charlie</Review>< Pictures>

<text>My visit to Rusnak Porsche on March 02, 2021 was excellent. I felt welcome, the representative was very friendly and courteous. I liked the fact that he went straight to the point on the service need it without wasting any time, he also gave my Panamera a full vacuum and wash, thanks a lot.< /text></record>

<text>I visited with service advisor Steve Ellis. After a few phone conversations with Steve I felt very comfortable. A simple task of having a new key programs for my 911S. While it was being handled with a technician, Steve and I shared pleasant conversation. When it was completed, I asked Steve for the nearest car wash. He said they are washing your car right now. A great experience, I am happy to have met Steve and will for sure do business with him in the future. Harold Brazee</text>< pics>

Eric B. and his team in Rusnak’s Porsche Service are just the BEST!! He explains everything, repairs are done promptly and done right the first time. Eric communicates very well, familiarizes himself with all prior service on my vehicle so he knows what issues it has had and anticipates what might need to be done to keep it running right without running up unneeded costs. He is considerate of my time, incredibly helpful, and genuine!! I would recommend him without reservation.< /Text>

<review>Took my '14 Boxster S to inquire about a small area of the windshield seal beginning to deteriorate, and they replaced the entire windshield free of charge! I continue to be impressed with their service on both my Porsche's, and Skip is ALWAYS professional and displays an absolute dedication to customer needs. I could not ask for a better service advisor, nor a better dealership!< /review>< pictures>

Highly recommend Rusnak Porsche. Mark Wasserman went above and beyond to help us find our car. We were able to remotely view our car and felt confident pulling the trigger hundreds of miles away. Thank you for being available 100% of the time and also getting us our car in time for our birthday trip.<//review>

Great service and attention do detail. Would buy a car from them anytime. Mark Wasserman was a great sales associate. Hustled to get my purchase done and delivered 120 miles away on Christmas Eve. First class service. Thanks.< /Review>

I have been a customer of Rusnak Porsche since 2017 and fully trust their expertise. The service is quick, staff is professional and responsive. Steve Ellis goes extra mile to make sure I get the best treatment and gives honest advice. It is a bit more expensive to service it at Rusnak, but I believe that quality work deserves a premium, it will save me time and money, down the road when reselling the car. One of the new features I found very helpful, is before I agree to charges they send me a video of the inspection to prove and show where the issues are and what needs to be fixed.< /Text>

Stopped in for a quick answer regarding my memory seat settings and next thing I know Kristin is setting me up with a loaner car, having my car in to be reprogrammed and washed with no questions asked. What a great experience! Completely different from other dealerships who you have to beg and plead with just to have your car looked at. I'm a customer for life. Any issues go see Kristin.<//Text>

I brought my Porsche Cayenne into the Westlake dealership to have a oil change and minor service. I’m happy to say that my service coordinator Eric took very good care of me. Within just 10 minutes I was in a loaner Cayenne and heading back home. Everyone in the service department had masks on so it was as safe from Covid as possible. Later in the day, I received a text to let me know my car was ready.
The entire service experience went very well.<//text>

Buying a vehicle at Rusnak Westlake Porsche was an A+ pleasurable experience. In the past I've dealt with pushy sales people so I was a bit hesitant when walking onto the lot. Mark Wasserman greeted me, pleasant and unassuming. He answered all of my questions about the makes, auto specs, shared interesting history of the company in an unhurried manner and was all around pleasant to work with. Mark provided fantastic customer service and made my buying experience at Rusnak a seamless one from start to finish. Highly recommend Porsche Westlake and Mark Wasserman.< /text>

<text>brought my 2011 cayenne in for service when another dealer couldn't figure out why the "check engine " light was still on. steve in service was terrific with communication and keeping me posted  as the mechanic went through the steps  looking for the cause. needless to say the service dept figured out there was a bad part, they swapped it out, and while we were waiting they fixed my liftgate and even were able to help arrange a little touchup on my bumper. while not the cheapest experience, overall i'm satisfied since all the work was excellent and fully communicated as to the price and the time required to complete.<//text>< Response>

<Text>Brilliant staff and service!
I could not be happier. So many car companies are accommodating and responsive when it comes to sales, but unresponsive and horrible to deal with come service time. Westlake Porsche is very different.
The service is efficient, professional and a real pleasure. The facilities are great, waiting times short and they literally go beyond the call of duty. I dealt with Steve Ellis and he clearly loves and knows Porsche cars and what Porsche drivers expect and need. He aced it, well done!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1579200023646, 'text': "Hi Marc, thank you for the great review!

The Financial advisor was candid and honest with my needs without trying to upsell for things that made no sense. My Sales Advisor was knowledgeable and gave my son a thrill by showing him and teaching him about many of the exotic cars in the showroom. It wasn’t quick but was still probably my best car buying experience with a dealer.< /review>

I’ve been taking my cars to Beverly Hills Porsche and South Bay Porsche for years, but decided to try Rusnak Thousand Oaks since they had a discount for 4 year scheduled maintenance. What a mistake.

Skip Corvo was the first rude service person I’ve ever worked with at Porsche, even yelling at me at some point. I think he was just having a really bad day, but why yell at a customer?

I also worked with Alex (or Steve, not sure his name) who was one of the lead mechanics there, and working with him made me deeply regret taking my car to Rusnak. Nothing against Rusank as a whole, I am sure they are good, but my issue was with these two employees. I had specifically ordered a specific service for my car (I will spare you the details), and was assured it would be done. When I came to pick up the car, Alex (Steve?) made every excuse in the book for why he didn’t do the service, and talked down to me as if I didn’t know better. This service I had done at Beverly Hills and South Bay previously, but Rusnak tried to convince me it couldn’t be done instead of being straight with me that they just forgot or some other straight reason. And in the end, they still charged me for it!

Please think about going elsewhere for service, there are plenty great Porsche service shops in LA.<//Text>

Great experience at Rusnak Porsche in Westlake this week. Worked with Matt Wasserman and was very pleased with how he and the dealership as a whole operates. I drove 6 hrs to buy a car here, and drove back 6 hours the same day, and it was worth it! Highly recommend Rusnak Porsche!< /review>

<text>I recently purchased a new Macan S from another dealership and the car suffered a PDK failure a few days into ownership. Even though I did not purchase the vehicle from Rusnak Westlake, they gave me a fantastic loaner and took care of requesting and installing a new transmission. I highly recommend them.

<Review>The service department at Rusnak Porsche is absolutely outstanding, something that is unfortunately rare these days.  Service writer Steve Ellis, manager Sam Abergel and master mechanic Mark Leach are the very best in the business.  Mark is the most skilled and knowledgeable mechanic I have ever met.  The customer service staff are friendly and always happy to assist.  These are true car people you can trust.  I am lucky to have access to such an amazing team for some of my most precious possessions.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80e825b82e90406d:0x70849a570d378bfb</Gmap_id>< Rating>

<review>The best Porsche service anywhere, whether dealer or independent. Great service advisors, extremely knowledgeable and competent technicians, honest and high quality work, and fair prices. I wish every place was this good. Excellent sales team as well, but I tend to buy my cars and keep them a long time. I will definitely come back here to buy my next Porsche (I already bought 3 Porsches from Rusnak Westlake over the past couple of decades)

Since my original review a while ago, I've brought several friends in who were looking for Porsches. All of them came away happy with new Porsches, and some brought their friends who were also looking for Porsches. Still the absolute best place for service. Steve Ellis is the best service advisor I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.

Feb 2021 update: still the best car service experience anywhere. I always leave with my expectations far exceeded. It simply doesn't get any better than Rusnak/Westlake Porsche!< /review>< Pics>

My salesman, Kareem, was so efficient and patient and kept us posted on the status of the car I wanted to test drive.  He was so easy-going and answered all my questions so patiently.  I love his no-pressure sales manner.  This car-buying experience was the best!</Review>

<review>We left two messages for Steve Ellis about scheduling repair of my Porsche Cayman clock and map before he called back saying he would be on vacation. When the car was turned in there were no loaner cars available until the following week. The car was in for two days with the problems still remaining yet with a new battery that was not needed. It was conveyed to us that they did not check the clock or map after two days of being in service there. Initially we were told it was fixed so we kept getting mixed answers. We also were told that the manager is aware of the problems but nothing seems to happen. We were told to bring the car back next week when a loaner car was available or we could keep it there for over the weekend +2 days more until a loaner would be available. Needless to say we will go elsewhere.<//review>< Response>

They are not worry about selling vehicles. Asking for further details of Macan, their responses are very frustrating.

I am looking for a Macan with pre collision pkg and ACC and I don’t find it on Westlake Porsche website. I ask their salesman(Mark Stratmeyer), but he just told me to search Westlake Porsche website. ?Hello, are you going to sell a vehicle or just ruin Westlake Porsche reputation<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I was beyond disappointed by my experience with Reed Galloway at the Audi Dealership in Westlake Village, CA. I waited in a parking lot for Reed to call me back to provide options of what to do. My husband finally drove from home and followed my to the dealership less than 2 miles away. When asked why he didn’t call me after hearing me crying on the phone, he said he was very busy.  An apology would have been an appropriate response. His lack of knowledge of my Audi A3 was surprising! When I called for an update (since I heard nothing from him) Reed first told me my car was taken apart and they were trying to figure out why my convertible top on my little over one year old car wasn’t working. When I asked Reed if they had actually taken the top completely off, after stumbling over his words he admitted that it wasn’t actually “taken apart”, but that they were checking the censors. Once I received the car, the back seats were down and items I left in the car were laying on the back seat in disarray. When I asked how to put the seats back, he didn’t know and just stood there. I had to ASK HIM to go and find someone who did. Another lack of of the “Truly Exceptional” service they promise: Every car I’ve owned and taken to a dealership for service ( Ford, Chrysler & Nissan)  have always returned my car clean & vacuumed at minimum. This was not the case at this Audi Dealership. Considering I paid more than 3 times that of past cars I was a little shocked. Reed stood there and watched me take out mats to dust off as well as use my fiber cloths I keep in my car to remove sap etc. Not once offering to help. My girlfriend, who chose an Audi based on my recommendation, said she was very pleased with Adam in the service department. So I will give the service department another chance, WITH ADAM, for my future needs. I enjoy going out of my way to praise excellent service. I do not enjoy writing this negative experience, but feel it’s important for the Dealership, as well as consumers, to be  informed of this unprofessional customer service I was given.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<user>107268615478802279035< /user><username>Tahseena Kahn<//username><text>I used to live by the reservoir and had the opportunity to jog around the reservoir every day.  It's a 2.5 mile loop.  I'd get an easy 5 mile jog every day.  I felt I'd get to breath fresh air every day.  There's a dog park as well.  The reservoir went through some renovations recently and pics were taken few months ago.  Parking is on the side of the street and is free. You can park and walk or jog around the reservoir.<//text>< response>

<Review>First time here, so I might have to come back and rewrite this review. My initial thoughts are...

+Red Wines are booooomb (loved the blend and the Cabernet we tried)

-Wasn't sold on the whites and I need to try more.

+The live music scene in the back was a whole vibe and so much fun!!! We had the best time and ordered food from surrounding restaurants.

+Ambiance was spot on.

+Staff was super nice and helpful.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMRvfTmuflwHItbkX-ZdC1N05qxchBV3yjGgw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1617559935917, 'text': "Ashley,\nWe're so pleased that you had a great time and really loved our red wines.

<Text>Went for a wedding reception that was hosted at this venue. Everything went off without a hitch and we had a fantastic time. The venue itself was clean, and spacious. The stage they had worked great for the couples dances, and the music system worked out great. The bartender was absolutely amazing. She was on top of everything we needed and her customer service was top notch.
Great wine. Great hosting. A high recommendation from me, two thumbs up.<//Text>< Pictures>

It's got an amazing set up, with open air seating, rocking sound system, more wines then you could ever want (if that's even a thing), local food deliveres, local musicians in the crowd and on the stage, and the staff is incredible...

Check out their calendar for the musician line up and check them out!</Text><Rate>4< /Rate><user>116650777578164782064<//user><user_name>Matt Curran< /user_name><gmapID>0x80dc6ff1f1fb85a5:0x94979de534f8c268< /gmapID></record>

I really love this wine bar. They have strict time slots so more people are able to enjoy. Love the live music options. You can order takeout from across the street at the Thai or Italian restaurants. The wine selection is great and customer service is awesome. Would totally recommend!</review>

<text>This is one of the best places I’ve been to when visiting California (locally owned too!). The quaint atmosphere is relaxing, the wine is incredible, and the food options from surrounding restaurants are excellent. Especially during the pandemic, it’s hard to find fun places like this where people are careful, but still social. Service was perfect and everyone that works there is very personable. The live music at Coomber Craft Wines is always a distinguishing feature as well. The Coomber’s winery produces wines with some very smooth and sophisticated flavor profiles. You have to plan to spend a night out here if you’re visiting North County, and consider a wine club membership if you’re local.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1609784026477, 'text': 'Joseph,\nThank you so much for your positive and informative review.

<Review>Great new place to enjoy after a long day. A welcome sight to Downtown Oceanside. Skip the owner and his friendly staff are very welcoming and grateful to each customer. All the details put into this place, will keep you looking around to only find something new to admire....not to mention the wine and the  choices are great. We will be back again and again. Well done Skip Coomber 👍🍷<//Review>< response>

<Text>Where to start with this review? The delicious wine? The friendly service that quickly makes you feel like family? The ridiculously fun wine pick up parties (well, pre-COVID at least)? Coomber is special. You walk in and are immediately greeted with a huge smile because the staff actually get to really know the regulars. The wine itself has a wide spectrum of varietals, prices, vintages, and "quality". I put that in quotes because it isn't necessarily the most expensive stuff that we actually enjoy the most. The Santa Maria Pinot Noir is fantastic and a great value. The chardonnays are all slightly different and would fall into that category as well. Regardless of whether to stop in for a glass (when it opens up for tastings instead of take out bottles) or become a wine club or locker member, give it a shot. You'll feel at home!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN94H8c601vs1LGyD9FeR-lkMCzG_Fu-wlMYblK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs4GW5WkL4s3ukSwB59a3YDhBiQ-vwdYfFKzMi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Coomber Wines Tasting room is a great addition to downtown Oceanside. Coomber has an extensive selection of Whites and Reds. Our wine hosts were Ian and Megan, who were both very knowledgeable about the wines. Ian greeted us with a complimentary taste of their Rose, which is light and delicate. We opted for an All Red Tasting which consisted of 3 Pinot Noirs and 3 Cabernets. Like all good wine tastings they start out light and get progressively more robust. Ranging from the 2016 Vintner's Collection California Pinot Noir, which has a gorgeous bouquet and is light and playful to drink and the way up to the 2012 Private Reserve Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon which is very earthy with big flavors that open up as you hold it in your mouth. Coomber is dog-friendly and all the furnishings are made from repurposed materials from the bar to the light fixtures made from old wine barrel rims.<//Text><user>113282615052165438213<//user><Gmap_id>0x80dc6ff1f1fb85a5:0x94979de534f8c268< /Gmap_id>< Name>

What a BLAST we had last night at Coomber! It was our first time there, and we absolutely LOVED the atmosphere. They had live music, the wine was DELICIOUS, and we really appreciated all of the smiling faces from the staff. Lisa was our server and she was so friendly, and attentive. We will definitely go back again soon! Thanks Coomber!<//Text>

We went and saw Nightbloom perform 🤘🏻💋 and had Heidi as our guide/bartender. BEST WINE TASTING EVER. Music 5 stars, wine 5 stars (get the reserve cab, it’s worth the $40), and Heidi is great to talk to and gives great wine recommendations. Wish I lived there so I could join their wine club!!! Will definitely be back when Heidi is working. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</Review>

Awesome new addition to downtown Oside. Just stopped in after noticing they were open, everyone was super friendly and welcoming. We had the kids with us which was no problem as they were able to have fun out in the back patio area. Stop by and give this place a try, you'll be glad you did. BTW, the wine was great. This coming from a beer drinker 😉.</text>

Quality wines throughout the red and white flights. Their Cabernets are especially great-full bodied yet smooth with just enough tannins for balance.  The atmosphere is great to. Classic old brick walls and wood rafters then a very nice outdoor area with live music!</text>

<Review>I requested AC preventative maintenance service and Caesar showed up on time. During the service, he discovered another problem requiring attention and took care of that too. He did all that without hesitation or complaint, despite it being a Friday afternoon. :)  Now, I can relax in the comfort of a cool home. :) :)

Thanks Caesar and Caesar.  Hope you all have a great weekend!< /Review>< Pictures>

No problems scheduling, they had an opening the day after I called. A Saturday service call, same price as a week day!! The technician was knowledgeable and efficient. Did the routine service, then found a couple of problems that was impeding the HVAC's efficiency. Total time to have it fixed was minimal.<//Review>

I must say and let anyone out there know that if you are in need of any kind of AC service, look no further. Arctic Air is your best choice! I tried many companies and they are the best; Great customer service, they respond quickly, they keep you informed as to the progress. The best pricing and with no hassles.< /review>

I'd give them 0 stars if I could honestly. We purchased an air conditioner unit from them around 2011 with a warranty that extends into approximately 2022. First Arctic Air didn't install the unit correctly which cause water damage to our roof after some rainstorms passed by. After having people inspect the roof we had another local air conditioner company inspect the unit and tell Arctic Air how it was installed incorrectly. Later on after many complaints of one of our rooms not receiving enough cold air, Arctic Air thought it was a great idea to install a new vent that requires a filter 11 and 1/2 feet in the air on the roof of the tallest room in our house. However where the company really shined was this summer when the unit broke down. After waiting for hours for their serviceman to show up and take a look at the unit they informed us that the parts they needed were not available on weekends through our warranty and that we would either have to wait until the following Monday to get the parts through our warranty cause the place they get them from was already closed because it was Friday. However they "generously" offered to get the part for us the following morning if we paid them 350 dollars for it. We opted to get a second opinion on the unit after hearing the unfair price and ultimately decided to pay the 350. The next day they showed up, fixed the unit and charged us 750 dollars instead. Take my advice, don't call this company and forget they even exist. Take your money elsewhere.< /Text>

Wow great food. 5 star. The white cheddar and bacon mac and cheese is the best in the valley. No question. Also more dishes were great. Always love this place and never a disappointment.< /text>

What an incredible meal, even boxed and delivered during the pandemic. So unbelievably fresh, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. The salmon was one of the best I've ever had. Even the pita bread was perfect.< /Review>

First night in Napa, we Google and found this restaurant.  Good location. Very interesting Mediterranean flavours, great appetizers. The grilled octopus was so tender, just enough charred/smokiness. Stuffed grape leaves was ok. Baklava was really good, flaky Phyllo,  not too sweet.<//review>

Tarla boasts an extensive selection of food and drinks and a line of tables going down the sidewalk, but when we went for brunch at 12:30 on a Sunday, they were already out of two items that we wanted (octopus salad and fried calamari) and promptly ran out of the third (zucchini fritters) after we ordered (the table next to us tried and failed).

That said, we really enjoyed our food! The zucchini fritters were freshly made and delightful--if you're going to eat something fried, it might as well have some vegetable content. I thoroughly enjoyed my crab benedict with spinach, and my fiancee liked the beef and lamb gyro plate, despite the sting of disappointment over not having the octopus. The side potatoes were shockingly fantastic, well made and well seasoned. In a futile attempt to slow the expansion of my waistline, I usually try not to overload on carbs, but these potatoes were so good I just gave up and shoveled them in.

The Black Manhattan cocktail was decent, but I advise that you stay away from the Tarla Sangria. It was sadly diluted, and what little flavor could be detected was just not good. I couldn't finish even half of it.

Service was excellent, and we really appreciated our energetic and informative server, who did a great job despite having to run up and down the sidewalk to get to her tables.

Overall, this was a great spot for an outdoor Mediterranean brunch, provided you arrive early enough to order what you want before they run out!</Text>

<Text>Watch Out! for Take Out

Tarla Mediterranean looked like the local favorite and must visit while enjoying the downtown scene. During this Covid-19 period we opted for the (Online) Take Out: The order included 2 lamb burgers, and one Greek salad with Lamb kebab skewer. After departing for our outdoor picnic, we soon realized that the take out order did not include essential napkins or plastic utensils. Later we discovered the potatoes that accompanied the burgers were uncooked and tough to bite into. The lamb skewer was also found RAW. Overall, this experience was found lacking any time in Tarla's kitchen or near a fire. For a busy spot I can see how consistency can get lost, but for our singular experience we were completely dissatisfied.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Mm mm what a delish Mediterranean experience. We originally made ressies for 7pm on a Saturday after wine tasting, but need some extra rest before dinner, and they gladly moved out our ressie time to 8pm. As easily as they were able to accommodate, we were expecting a light crowd. But boy were we wrong. There were tons of outside seating, and about a dozen ppl waiting around to be seated.

There was a bit of disorganization as the hostesses scrambled to figure out where to seat ppl. They did, however, get us seated right away (after the 15mins it took to just check-in). The waiters constantly filled and refilled out water glasses, which was definitely needed after a long day of wine tasting!

We opted to get one main and more sides, since things were all sounding delish. While the truffle mushroom risotto sounded amazing, we opted to lean more on the Mediterranean inspired dishes - whole branzino, octopus salad, and meatballs. My buds didn’t go Mediterranean and tried the pasta and burger...which they both thought were meh. Fortunately for us, our dishes were spot on! Branzino was crispy on the outside, and buttery soft on the inside. As for the octopus salad, it was perfectly tender.

Tl;dr: check-in for free hummus. Order the inspired Mediterranean dishes! Make a ressie to skip the line!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Everything we had was amazing!!
Greek dip trio, fresh housemade dolma, the beef and lamb gyro, the chicken kabob plate.
I only got a picture of one dish because the others were gone too fast.<//Review>

Wonderful meal as usual! My favorite is the zucchini cakes. Today we tried a new (to us) dessert made with philo dough honey cheese and coconut. It was amazing! We paired it traditional Turkish coffee that came in super cute cups!< /text>

Cute little spot, nice outdoor seating in the shade.
I ordered the chicken kebab on pita with Greek fries and a blood orange margarita.

The chicken was good although it had a hint of fish - maybe it was grilled near fish. The pita got too soggy so next time I'll ask for that on the side. I was expecting actual Greek fries,  not home fries with oregano, but they were tasty. The margarita had good flavor. I specifically asked for no salt yet they managed to drown the rim in it. The drink was pretty small for $13.<//Review>

<time>1616620631437< /time><Rating>2<//Rating><Text>I believe our experience could have been better but our waiter made it really bad. We had two vegans in our group of four. The waitress made it seem like she understood what vegan was.. when we ordered the greek trio she said it was all vegan. After we finished it we noticed that one of the items in the tiro could be ordered alone and had cheese in it. When we asked the waitress if it did she said it did and acted like it wasn't a big deal at all. The vegan's ordered two items that said vegan online but in the actual restaurant everyone was confused. This place needs to figure out their menu - so many of their dished say vegan online but end up not being vegan when you get to the restaurant. Maybe a better waitress would have improved this experience. Disappointment overall.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8085065d3843b835:0x998db2a2aac2f197</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Food was just ok. Halloumi quite good, dip trio was mediocre, and lamb was just ok. Management however was terrible. When we got there, they told us brunch ended at 2. We explained to the waitress, then the manager when he came over to check in, that we were disappointed because we made the 215 reservation for brunch because their own website said brunch until 3pm. The waitress was nice and apologized and asked the kitchen, but they refused. The manager however, didn’t even express real concern, or do anything to fix it- even if that’s just fix the website and apologize. He actually didn’t even believe me at first - I had to show him his own website!  We ordered food we didn’t even want and ended up taking it to go because I didn’t want to stay any longer. Bad experience and just ok food.< /Text>< Name>

My friend and I both agree that this is the best food we have had this year. Perfect scores on aesthetics, service and taste. In particular, every bite os full of flavor, whether it be lamb, or kale. Please try the saganaki, it has lots of delicate flavors. Moreover, the place has both expensive dishes as well as regular dishes, making it a nice and balanced restaurant.</review>

Nice place with good staff, but the food lacked flavor. The rice was good, but the chicken could've had a bit seasoning. The soup could've had a bit more salt and taste in general. The salad was drenched in oil but was quite good.<//text>

Seated at 7pm appetizers at 7:30pm entrees not till 9pm with one check in to say "chef is behind". Desert offered for waiting. Mean while table sat after us behind us and at our right served appetizers and drinks and entree in 45 minutes of seating. My partner and I sat for two hours for fries and entrees while everyone around us got all their food in 45 minutes. My partner's pasta was cold and the salmon was luke-warm.What made it worse was the table next to us ordered the same thing we do so we were not able to figure out why our food took so long and came out "warm". In summary food, was alright service makes you feel sub par. It never feels good when other people seated after you get to eat and leave before you get your order.< /Text>

My husband been Turkish, everytime we go to a Turkish restaurante in the US we don't have high expectations, after reading out Tarla description on their menu and how the restaurant prides on the origins of the ingredients, it did raised our expectations.

We order the dip trio, grilled octopus salad and meatballs, none of them disappointed us. I will recommend all of them but specially the octopus and meatballs.

The pomegranate cabernet short rib with risotto was really delicious.

My husband described their pistachio baklava as the best he has tried in the US!

They even have Turkish Raki, a nice environment and their staff is very good, Santiago took very good care of us. The owner and manager were also taking good care and walking around the tables asking if everything was good. It feel very personal.
Their price is very good and their portion sizes are very good.

My husband only disappointment was the absence of Turkish tea, we understand most of customers would not ask for it, however we will strongly suggest the establishment to offer complimentary Turkish tea to their customers pairing baklava, promoting the culture.

We are planning to come back tomorrow for their lentil soup. Please don't miss this place if you are in Napa< /text>

Great Burrata Arugula Salad. Outdoor seating was nice with the heaters. Also loved the meatballs. Got the dip trio, good portions of pita but the dip portions were a bit small, all delicious though!</text>

I know it's a trend to have fancier names in Menu, BUT I feel making menu easier to understand will help attract more crowd!< /Text><rate>4< /rate>< Response>

<text>We dined here for my birthday while in Napa. (6/12/20) Food was mediocre and so was the service. Presentation of the food was great but lacking in taste. We ordered the flaming fromage (very bland) and fish (decent) as well as the coconut dessert (overly sweet). The drinks were wayyy strong and I like drinking...
The host was very friendly and prompt on seating us. Based off of this one visit, we wouldn’t return. The pictures look amazing though and presentation is great.< /text><Name>Melissa Madden</Name>< Pictures>

<Text>This review has nothing to do with the new way they do things due to Covid. This is based on the food, the staff, an the place.

Our waitress was personable, professional, but down to earth. You could joke an she got it.

What I can only assume was the manager. Which I hope. Otherwise some guy is just going around making small talk. It’s nice to see a manager out an about. That’s nice. I get he was trying to share other business to visit. But he came back twice to talk about random things. While eating.

The place was clean and busy.

The food was mixed. The oil used on the fries is to die for. The kale salad was pathetic. It list all these wonderful toppings it comes with an then when you get it. It’s really a bowl of kale with like 20 little sparse toppings.

They don’t really have anything for kids.

An the listed beverage for beer on the menus slightly different then what’s brought out to you.

There’s one bathroom. In the center of the room practically.

I’d order the fries to go and prob not come back.< /Text><time>1593415127110<//time>< pictures>

Amazing food. The wait staff were very friendly but the service was a bit slow. I would say it was worth the wait though. There was a crowd of people sitting next to us that were a bit of obnoxious, but that isn't essentially the fault of the business however.<//Review>

We ordered the stuffed eggplant and lamb kabob. The eggplant was great, but the rice they served with it was very bland and was almost floating in the pool of oil they added to the dish that was underneath the rest of the entrée. The lamb was seasoned perfectly but was quite overdone, the vegetable medley that accompanied the kabobs was delicious.< /review>

My usually cooked veggie averse husband loved his roasted cauliflower, and my fried kale was wonderful---beautiful color, crisp, & full of flavor. I had the braised rib dinner, that although good, lacked the flavor from the pomegranate-cabernet it was braised with. My hubby had the lamb kebab that was very good, but the roasted veggies were the stand-out. A very nice rolled pistachio baklava with an excellent vanilla bean gelato for desert. Excellent wine list and bar drinks. A bit of a miss with the service. Our server pleasant enough, but he didn't write our order down. So, our Greek salad arrived after our entrees because he forgot to order it, but he did comp us the salad. He also asked us twice what we ordered for dessert. A pleasant dining experience.< /review><user_name>Cindy Stahl<//user_name>< Pictures>

Food was average, service was below average, stay clean of their tasteless margarita. Lamb burger is decent, crab burger is so cheaply made with barely any crab meat.

Disappointed.<//text>

We had an excellent lunch starting with a trio of spreads on fresh soft slightly charred pita bread, then delicious kebabs and sandwiches. This was during COVID so we had trouble finding a place for dinner. The owner went above and beyond and set us up with another excellent restaurant for dinner that night.<//Text>

They were friendly and kind. They wore masks. However my crab sandwich smelled old and tasted not fresh.  I wasn't going to send it back because it was our first outing out to eat and my husband would've hated me doing that.  The waiter bussed his own tables with his fingers going inside glasses and I didn't see any disinfectant happening when wiping them off.   The bathroom was not clean either.  The only soap was in a plastic container that u had to pick up to use.  The toilet paper same thing.  None just to roll out u had to pick it up to use.  It felt dirty and unattended to.  They did not pay attention to the needs of today with cover and germs.  Cleaning really is what is needed!  Hire an extra person to do it or close up.  We won't be going back.</text>

Amazing restaurant with FANTASTIC service. The food doesn't disappoint but Daoud (manager), Alfredo (bartender), and Jose (server) were unbelievably hospitable. Excellent food— get the zucchini cakes and any dessert!< /text>

From the reservation experience to the food to the service.. all was outstanding. We were a party of 12 and every guest made a point of saying how much they enjoyed their meals.

<review>The food and the service were both delightful. Our table of 8 tried a variety of the menu's Mediterranean dishes and there wasn't one complaint. Cocktails were inventive. The waiter was helpful with wine selection. The birthday girl received free bubbly and baklava (best baklava I've ever tasted). It was very loud inside thanks to a number of larger parties like ours, so you might want to eat outside for a quieter experience.</review><Gmap_id>0x8085065d3843b835:0x998db2a2aac2f197< /Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>110589143571927050485</UserId.></record>

Came here for lunch. Indoor and outdoor seating was available, we sat inside. Took a while to get service, ok it happens, but when people sat down after us and got drinks and food before us, irked me a little, but they did bring out some free pita and hummus for us which was nice. Gf ordered the meatballs and I got the chicken kabab. Food was ok. Nothing horrible, nothing great.<//review>

I love the concept of Tarla's. I love Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. But. Tarla's goes through cycles of having a great Chef that knows the flavors to a cook that sort of knows the flavors. This creates a very inconsistent dining experience. Bar is well stocked, friendly team. I just wish there was better consistent food quality.</Review>

We visited your establishment recently and were extremely dissatisfied with the service. There were lights on the other tables (even empty) but they neglected to bring one for our table and we ate our meal in the dark. Will never go to Tarla anymore.< /Review>

<text>We just had a terrific lunch at Tarla. We ordered the Greek dip trio with warm pita triangles for starters and all three dips were so creamy and delicious. My husband had the lamb kebab lunch plate-- a perfect combination of tender lamb, freah salad, rice, tender chickpeas, and a light, creamy lentil soup. I had the Turkish meatball starter plate with hummus, fried Kale, mushrooms, and more. Wonderful food, very filling, beautiful presentation! And our server, Jason, was attentive and personable. Will definitely be back!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Terrible private event experience. We booked a private dining room for a corporate event. When we arrived, we were seated in the main dining room with other parties, a public bar, and the kitchen. We were told there was an AV system in our “private” room - there was no AV system. Very disorganized staff, I requested wine on the tables when we arrived and they didn’t even know which wines I had ordered.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Located in downtown Napa, the food was tasty and both food and wine were at reasonable prices, especially for Napa. I enjoyed the salmon and mynwife’s Chicken was tender and tasty. I would not say it is the most memorable meal but it was both enjoyable and tasty. The only negative is that you are moved through rapidly. Before the appetizer had a chance to digest, the entrees arrived. Having said that, the food was good, as well as the prices and being downtown enabled us to take an after dinner stroll along the Main Street. Would recommend for either a couple or a group.<//review>< Pics>

Ate here on an impulse and due to reviews. Of our 3 entrees, 2 were excellent- the scallops w risotto & the grilled octopus salad, appetizer spreads were very good. Unfortunately the grilled chicken skewers were dry, and my cocktail tasted like glorified OJ.<//text>

There are a lot of restaurants in this area; some with better ambiance than Tarla. But I have to say that the food was delicious!! The Branzino dish in particular was fantastic. The staff too were attentive and friendly.< /review>

<Review>This is a late post, but I have returned to Napa after assisting with the Napa valley fires last October that ravaged the area and destroyed many homes. Eight of our firefighters from Washington state broke away for a dinner while on break from the fire lone and are at Tarla. What we experienced in the midst of a local disaster was amazing! While the food was expertly prepared and very delicious, what was even more amazing was the service and hospitality. Since we were in uniform, the head chef and owner had come out to our table and thanked us for coming to their hometown to help local responders. They then told us that the meal was going to be picked up by them with no charge to our party. This included complimentary appetizers that were brought to our table by a party eating at the bar and dessert offered by another resident of the area. What is so amazing is the generosity provided by those who were directly affected by the fires and one who had even lost her home. What a wonderful story, especially in the current climate in which we live. Thank you all and I will be visiting Tarla with my family to show appreciation to the staff today.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>We enjoyed a late meal after a long day of traveling.  We had 2 appetizers which were good, but for the same $$ would have been better spent on entrees.   We had the lamb burger, chicken and lamb kebobs which were all fabulous.  The wait staff was pleasant but not hovering.  It's a bit pricey, but the quality of food was excellent and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The food was delicious and the service was attentive but I also consider ambiance and patrons as part of dining experience.  For a Saturday night with my loved one, I was so disappointed to hear women “ladies” who were drunk (some with husbands or with other “ladies” use “four letter words including the f bomb” very loudly for all to hear.”   Is this the kind of dining experience the owner would like patrons to have?   It is not worthy of Napa and should be changed.  I also will add that the acoustics exacerbate the situation —so add some soft materials to absorb all the noise.  Instead of having a good conversation, we were drowned out by very offensive language and couldn’t wait to get out of there!  Finally, invest in dining chairs and tables that reach beyond zoey’s.  You’ve got a great menu—it deserves so much more!   Thank you!   Hope to see change next time!< /Review>

I’m a regular here because the food is ALWAYS AMAZING. I’m greek too and was so excited to find this place - their zucchini cakes (kolokithokeftedes) are phenomenal I get them at least once a week. And their kebabs are grilled to perfection. Such amazing flavors in all the entrees. And the spinach pie (spanakopita) is as good as my grandmas which is something I don’t say ever! And get this - their Mac and cheese is out of this world. One of my top macs that i have ever had! They bake it too so it’s just perfect! I took my mom here who is straight out of greece and she loved it which is rare!<//Text>

Food was amazing. Service was terrible. Our server didnt seem too interested in us after we decided not to drink any alcohol. There was just no more room in our system for more wine. Also, I dont understand why a bartender thinks slimy, brown limes are ok to be served...</Text>

<Text>One of the best in the Napa area no doubt! Made reservations well enough in time and it was great to get seated right away.

We had a yelp deal to start with and we got hummus and started with some local wine. We ordered the truffle short ribs and I got the Branzini. I personally liked the truffle short ribs more than the branzini but both tasted great. The branzini suace was rich and tasted very fresh. The ribs had the added flavor due to the truffle and it's one of the best I have tried.

Parking can be a challenge in the area sometimes depending on when you come since this is the heart of downtown but once you get a spot you can keep it and roam the area.

I recommend you come here if you like Mediterranean food.. they are amazing and the food can't disappoint!!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Maybe the food wasn't my thing or maybe the early opening didn't allow the staff to get up to speed.< /review>

Called ahead and got a table for 7, which can be tough.  Great square table that made talking and sharing easy.  Great service. Food was good, although nothing note worthy.  A good place to meet friends have a nice drink and eat some decent food.< /Review>

Mother's Day Brunch.  The people are wonderful.  The service was excellent, warm and caring.  The food was good.  We were later in the day and some of the dishes were gone but there was ample food and no shortage.  I found their ad a little misleading.  It said "Bottomless Mimosas.  Mother's Day Brunch $39.00"  The way it reads it seems to say the Bottomless Mimosas are part of the $39.00.  There was a $15.00 charge for the mimosas.  It felt like a bait and switch which didn't feel good at all.  We stayed and had a wonderful brunch.  My first reaction was to walk away because of what I felt was misleading advertising.  I'm glad we stayed but want other customer's to be aware of some questionable advertising for this brunch.< /text>

<review>I was seated quickly and the atmosphere was nice. I asked the waiter ONE question: Does the risotto have onions? He asked if I was allergic, and I truthfully said no, but I can't eat them. He confidently assured me there were no onions in the dish.

When the food arrived, he practically dropped it and ran. I picked a handful of large onion pieces out of the risotto, put them on the edge of my plate, and walked out. I get that not every dish can be modified, but I'll gladly order around that. I do NOT countenance being lied to.</review></record>

A fantastic meal, my wife and I shared the spanakopita to start, which had wonderfully light pastry. We also shared the mushroom risotto and salmon linguine, both seasoned and balanced in their own perfect way. To top it all off, I left my credit card at the restaurant and Santiago remembered my hotel, called it to confirm, and then drove to drop it off on his way home, and then refused a tip. All said and done, great food and an above and beyond sense and quality of service ensures we will be back as repeat customers.< /review>

Dined here in the summer. We entered almost closing hours and yet was still warmly welcomed. The dishes here are so flavorful. Fresh tomatoes, wonderful seasoning. After our whole Napa trip has ended, we kept thinking of this restaurant. Keep up the excellent food quality.<//text>

Great venue with easy to find parking. Went for a birthday dinner - no birthday freebie. We ordered the spanikopita, grilled oxford salad, lamb burger, and a grilled scallop entree (special of the day). The spanikopita app was served as a large triangle vs. smaller individual sized servings. Homemade and very good filling to dough ratio. The grilled octopus salad was fresh and balanced with the different textures across the plate. The scallops were perfect, full of flavor and filling. The lamb burger needed salt (which I'm grateful to add instead of take away) but it needed garlic!! Great value overall.<//Text>

I had a delicious salad with strawberries and quinoa with an enjoyable vinagrette. There were four large, bite-size pieces on the lamb skewer that I added. My BF had l the Greek Salad; he thought was heavy on the red bell peppers. He also had a chicken dinner, which was well-proportioned with two skewers of chicken and plenty of vegetables. The service was very attentive and timed well. I would highly recommend.</review>

Fabulous! Four of us enjoyed appetizers, main courses, desserts and drinks. Each and every dish was extraordinary. We regret not living much closer to this restaurant and finding nothing comparable in our home town. We are considering a return visit on our second day in Napa just to take advantage of the delicious opportunity! Darby, Lila, Randall and Vanessa<//text>

Really good mediterranean food, equally good service. My friend and I stopped for here lunch a few days ago while downtown, we started with the humus and pita, and then got orders of the crab sandwich and the chicken kebab respectively. Service was fast and polite, and the food was delicious. Would recommend!< /Text>

<review>I was at Tarla on Friday night back in March 2016. To my surprise there was no line, and the service was quick and efficient. The food was good, the drinks were OK too. Overall I was planning to give 4 stars review. But today I've discovered that I was overcharged. Apparently the waiter thought that 20% tip is not enough. So I recommend you either to pay with cash, or check your credit card statements.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
We went for lunch (3pm) because everything else opened at 5pm.. For appetizers we got the fried calamari and zucchini cakes with tzatziki (which were oily but had good flavor). For entree we got chicken kebab gyro and chicken kebab plate that included the lemon chicken soup. The food was good and quick, but it wasn’t amazing or authentic greek. But I wouldn’t mind coming back.</review>

Every time I go to TARLA, it feels like home. It is quite honestly faultless! This place is fancy without being pretentious. The approach is respectful of tradition, but open-minded. Service is attentive, yet personal and really quite delightful that almost all servers remember me from the last visit. A nice selection of drinks are on offer! The food is innovative and beautifully cooked and presented. They always serve their Authentic food promptly, and cooked to perfection. Staff are knowledgeable and rather fun, and actually it is lovely to see people enjoy their job!  Thank you to the owner and all the staffs for creating such a lovely atmosphere.
TARLA is unpretentiously PERFECT!
OUTSTANDING!!!< /review>

The lamb kebab was amazing. Service and ambiance were great. Only quibble is the price --the entrees range from $17-29 but most of them are in the mid $20s range</Review>

The food is more like Mediterranean fusion and it's just amazing!!! I had a delicious lamb kabob that was melting on the mouth and creme brûlée cheesecake for desert. The waitress was super nice and helpful. It could not be any better!!!<//review>

I never post on Google but feel compelled to. After waiting 30 minutes for my reservation at 8pm tonight, the hostess promised me we were next table for 2. As an aside, a guy also waiting for a table got in a fight with the bartender for being rude and slow. As I sat staring at the exchange I saw her give away our table for another party of two! She had the audacity to tell me they had a reservation before us, so they were 45 minutes late for their rezo? Lies, you gave it away, own it. Another 15 minutes goes by and we're seated at the table NEXT TO THE BATHROOM. We were at a 4 top and I asked to sit at the table next to us, another 4 top that also opened up and she tells me that they need the space for a party of three?! Don't know what the difference is between our 4 top and that one, it's the exact same table. As we look over the menu, sensing my frustration, they ask if we'd like to sit at another table, a two top, yet again by the bathroom. Stay away from this place at all costsl, food is not worth the incompetent front of house.<//Text>

VERY Rude wait staff, way salty Angus Beef Musakka which was 90% made out of potatoes with one paper thin slice of eggplant so you cannot even taste the eggplant flavor (I am from the Mediterranean region and musakka should be predominately eggplant across the region with some variations between different countries). Under-seasoned to bland Charcoal Grilled Lamb Tenderloin Kebab. My friend asked for the dessert menu as he wanted to try Baklava. While we were reviewing the dessert menu, apparently our waiter overheard me critiquing the musakka, they closed the check and sent it with a different waiter for us to pay and leave (in another way they refused to serve my friend dessert and kicked us out because they overheard me telling my friend my honest opinion about the food).<//text><pics>None<//pics><user_id>112169295938762852861</user_id><response>{'time': 1523402757731, 'text': 'Good Afternoon Hossam, Thank you very much for bringing to my attention.

Couldn't have asked for a better dinner experience than Tarla in Napa. Our waiter, Kyle, had countless recommendations from the menu (hummus, dolma, Napa's Hindsight wines) and hospitality. Recommend to any and all visitors to the region!</review>

Creative Turkish and Greek food from mussaka to more elaborate entrees. Also, we tried the stuffed apricots desert and it was lovely. Finally, they do serve Turkish coffee - and can even read yuou future using the coffee grounds :-)<//Review>

We were in CA for the weekend and chose Tarla Mediterranean Restaurant because Mediterranean food just sounded good. We went early on a Saturday, and the place was empty. For the life of me, I cannot see why. It is a beautiful space, and everything about the meal was wonderful. We started with some Hummus, grilled thallium and the Brussels sprouts, and they were all absolutely fresh, excellently prepared and presented, and delicious. The three members of our party had Shish Kabob, Beef Sharma and the Sea Bass, and we were all much more than satisfied with our choices. The service was attentive without being overbearing, and the experience was wonderful from start to finish. I don't know why there wasn't a line out the door, as this restaurant deserves it.<//text>

Went here for dinner after a day of wine tasting.

For a starter, we ordered the meze plate to split. To be honest, I was pretty underwhelmed with this. The hummus and baba ghanoush did not resemble the authentic versions of themselves, but the dolmas were pretty good.

However, this place did seriously redeem themselves with their drinks and entrees. My friend and I split the white truffle and mushroom risotto- which is literally HEAVEN! SO delicious, as well as the Pan Roasted Mediterranean Branzino Fish- which was equally delicious.

They were also very accommodating to my gluten free diet. Each of us ordered cocktails, and they were all phenomenal! Highly recommend the chambord margarita!< /Review>

<review>Great place and amazing food! My brother and I had calamari as appetizer. As entrée he had the chicken shish kebab and I had the meatballs. For dessert we had the excellent baklava they make in the premisses.<//review>< pictures>

We have been to Tarla several times and always enjoyed it, but tonight was a disappointment. The meze was delicious as always but the moussaka, previously delicious, was different this time -- a huge multilayered square hunk, overcooked, unattractive, with a little red sauce. None of the three who ordered it could eat more than half.A new chef perhaps?
The service was good but the restaurant, though not fully booked, was very noisy. And they seem to have raised their prices. The four of us had one meze plate, three moussakas, one eggplant, four coctails, and one bottle of wine ($31), -- no desserts or coffees - and the bill came to $187.00 before tip..We do not plan to return.</Review>

Food:
- Baba ganoush - nice and creamy with olive oil and parsley sprinkled on top; served with a nicely toasted pita
- Roast fish sandwich (bronzino) - fish is cooked to about medium with some parts being flaky and moist and other parts still raw.  It was pretty good, served with slaw and tzaziki sauce; Potatoes - lightly crisp chunks with paprika seasoning, and a side of spicy aioli for dipping
- Chicken kabob - one skewer with about 5 pieces, a bit dry. A pyramid of rice, soft and moist with some salt and chickpeas. The soup of the day was a slightly spicy tomato soup with some cheese on top

Service:
- good

Ambiance:
- large place, with outdoor seating
- nice, yet still casual< /text>

Good food and good service. Chicken gyro and beef gyro were very good. Portion size was gust right. Food was ready in about 10-15 min after the order. They have tables inside and outside.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Restaurant Turkish cuisine, for Napa level is good. Meals portions are small but well cooked. Given that you are in Napa, the wine list is appropriate)))). There are problems with the staff. Manager is not very easy. The guests are mostly satisfied, I was not very. Wine forgot to bring ordered, despite the fact that it is Napa). After the second Reminders were corrected, as a result they were given as a gift from the institution.

(Original)
Ресторан турецкой кухни, для Напы уровень хороший. Блюда порции небольшие, но хорошо приготовлены. С учётом того, что вы находитесь в Напе, винная карта соответствующая)))). Есть проблемы с персоналом. Менеджеру приходится не очень просто. Гости в большинстве довольны, я был не очень. Вино заказанное забыли принести, несмотря на то, что это Напа). После второго Напоминания исправились, в результате отдали в подарок от заведения.</Review>

(Translated by Google) A locally popular Mediterranean restaurant. I think it's more fusion than authentic. The turkey meatballs recommended by the person at the wine bar next door were definitely delicious. The salmon and pasta dish was delicious, but the pasta sauce was a little salty.
The dessert baklava and ice cream were really good.

(Original)
ローカルに人気の地中海料理屋さん。本場と言うよりはフュージョン系かな。隣のワインバーの人がお勧めしてくれたターキーミートボール、確かに美味しかった。サーモンとパスタの一品も美味しかったけど、パスタソースはちょっとしょっぱかったかな。
デザートのバクラバとアイスはめちゃ美味しかった。<//text>
