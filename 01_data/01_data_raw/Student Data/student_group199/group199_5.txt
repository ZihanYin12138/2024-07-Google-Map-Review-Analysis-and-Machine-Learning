What a delicious place to eat with friends! A group of us stopped by for dinner; we ordered different dishes to try them out. The food was fresh, their salads very tasty and their meats had delicious seasonings and flavor. We stayed a long time because the service was excellent (very friendly servers) and we really felt welcome. Their prices were the most surprising thing as each plate was around $10 and most restaurants in the area charge $16 and up. We had a really great time!<//text>

<review>Hummus was great with some nice options like ground beef on top of the hummus. The chicken was good and you get a lot of food for the price. I may return if I'm in town again, would like to try some other things. The pita bread was great.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNrsv6s0OPqJ9J41KXqa7EdlSD-K4UJ5-vI2Bg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqufhSQSzN6jf70X-fbXJQr4a-XQ_DQZSPtSbk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Date>1544136601147<//Date>< Rate>

<review>Worst experience ever from any of the restaurants in US. The service is really bad and pathetic. We went to the store and ordered. We had to wait for more than 1.5 hours and there were only a few people and few orders and almost everyone was waiting. Only one person to take the orders, serve , pack etc. Also they did not tell if it is going to take longer. Nothing was ready, they were frying falafel then and there, there were no pita. While taking the order they did not write the options and while serving other customers, they were asking about what do we want. The only one lady at the counter was running here and there. I saw how unhygienic the counter was. She put my pita sandwich on the counter, her hands were all filled with some sauce . And when we got our order the packet had all the sauce from her hands. It was grose.
I would have not written this review until I found a stapler pin in my mouth.
This place really needs some check and better service

And you can see all the reviews on google and on Yelp too, the business owner is not ready to accept any bad reviews or rather any suggestions.
If there is a problem with their service or delivery they should accept it. They are rather denying everything saying that these are false claims. Very funny</review><Date>1621968640212<//Date>< username>

I love Village Hummus and the atmosphere. My favorite meal is the falafel plate and I love the wraps especially. There’s such an amazing variety of foods to choose from! I also love the lava cakes and the various boba choices. The staff at village Hummus prepare meals quickly and provide quality as well.</Text>

<Text>We recently celebrated my mom's 75th birthday here and had a great time, with really good food and outstanding service. Their outdoor space is perfect, even if the weather on this day didn't cooperate. Debbie, our friendly server made it enjoyable, offering to take some pictures and even treated my mom to a delightful dessert. They are taking strong precautions to keep their space clean and everyone safe. So much looked good on their menu, will be back! Oh and their take-home dinners were a hit as well! Thanks for a great afternoon!</Text>< pics>

The management is clearly clueless and disorganized. If you have any complaint about the food you are treated as if you know nothing and the owner knows everything. I would highly doubt this place would pass a health inspection, it is incredibly disgusting.<//Text>

Only thing left of the old place is a piece of the menu on the right back wall.
Just ordered for the first time since it reopened and it's not good. It appears to have been sold and the new food is nowhere near the quality or flavor of the old food.
I ordered the falafel plate, the falafel is ok, the hummus has no flavor, and the salad is inedible. The hot green sauce is also not like it used to be.
My partner for the "beef shwarma plate" which is not shwarma at all, and is better described as low quality beef as a curry.
Sad one of my former favorites had taken such a dive.< /Text>< pics>

Please note that, most food ordered by this customer was not part of previous menu. I recently added turmeric rice, Beef and other great options to provide more choices to customers. Village Hummus is being attacked in many ways to bring our business down. From genuine customers, we receive many compliments about our unique green hot sauce, flavorful Shawarma, fresh flavorful Hummus and tasty food. This week itself, Village Hummus has earned 5 star rating on Door dash and Uber eats. People posting false information like this do not realize that genuine customers who try our food know the truth. Whoever is trying to damage Village Hummus reputation should know that it will be more appreciated by community. If you do not like our food we happily refund the money back.\nSorry to see you are writing misleading information here Lisa. If you did not like our food why didn\'t you bring it back to receive refund? Many customers who ordered food today before and after can see your message and know that you are misleading customers. You ordered Israeli salad and mixed greens. Salads are fresh out of bag and not cooked by us, so calling that as "not edible" is not logical. Other customers enjoying our food, know what our salad and food is like. You are comparing current food to the one that wasn\'t there before. You are hurting community by giving false information about a wonderful business. Defaming a small business, who sells high quality food is not the right thing to do. You may want to spend more time reflecting on your ethics than writing big false content on net.'}<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Had eaten here a few times over the last few years and always enjoyed it.. However the food we had tonight was not good.

Pita and hummus were fine. My wife got the shrimp plate and I got the lamb shawarma.

The shawarma was not shawarma. It seemed more like kind of a dry curry, but did not seem fresh. Both the lamb and the shrimp were so salty we couldn't finish them.< /Review><userid>105824792390281098006</userid>< Pics>

The bread and schug (green hot sauce) was very good.

The hummus was absolutely awful -- grey, slightly off flavor.

The tahini was bitter and bland. The cabbage salad was ok, but too much onion and under-seasoned. The fava beans were bland and tasted maybe a little off.

The shawarma was palatable, but in no way resembled shawarma -- more like a somewhat bland curry?

I now know that there is at least one thing that any Israeli or Palestinian can agree on: There is no reason to ever eat at this restaurant.

PS: It used to be good, if memory serves me... Not sure what happened.<//Text>

Monmouth is a true love of mine. Few things are better than telling a barista that you're in the mood for a medium-light roast and having him pick whatever beans best fit the mood. A bit overrun at times--but still worth it.<//Review>

<Text>Village Hummus used to be great. Looks like they got new management (maybe covid impact) and it is not the same. Just had a chicken pita that made me sick a few hours later. I was wondering as I ate it since the chicken was cold. The pita that used to be so tasty and fresh from an oven is no longer. It's not appetizing to sell boba, brunch, and med food all at once.</Text><GmapID>0x808f9ee1eca17a8b:0x8e3b999f316a7190< /GmapID>< Rate>

One of my month list style food! I love falafel. And this place falafel was best falafel i ever had. Outer part was hard and inside was soft. PITA BREAD was fresh quick food and comfort food i can say. I am vegetarian and for me this is icing on cake!</Review>

Old school place with Mexican specialties and many egg Benedicts.  Full bar.  May once have been a Denny's ambience.  Good service.<//text>

One of my month list style food! I love falafel. And this place falafel was best falafel i ever had. Outer part was hard and inside was soft. PITA BREAD was fresh quick food and comfort food i can say. I am vegetarian and for me this is icing on cake!</Review>

Hummus and schnitzel have rarely been so delicious as at Village Hummus. What a random but great find thanks to Yelp.

You'll see Village Hummus tucked into a mall/apartment complex with some limited street parking. Come in and the store looks fairly inconspicuous - a few tables (it's fairly small). Order at the counter with a few different variations on the dishes like pita variations to plate variations - it's a super straightforward menu. I went with the schnitzel and hummus for about $9ish.

When the plate came out, you get a good amount of food. Along with the hummus/schnitzel you'll get a couple big pita breads, chopped salad, pickles, tahini and lemon relish. You can also get the optional hot sauce dip (forgot the exact name here) which is actually pretty spicy but deliciously so. The hummus is plentiful and is made just right. The schnitzel is also fairly large and delicious.

Staff was super kind with some limited drink options. Definitely seems like a neighborhood kind of vibe. Really enjoyed it and hope to come back again soon when I'm in the area.</Text>

<Review>Great quality and tasting food - I love both the chicken schwarma and falafel, I always have a hard time choosing between the two. I like getting the plate as I can make my own combination and is less messy, though the pita wraps are more friendly to your wallet. Of course the hummus is delicious also - highly recommend!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1610596645429, 'text': 'Thank you Mina. We have more options now with Lamb and Beef.

<text>I've never been to Israel, but a good friend tells me that this place is as close as you're going to get. I don't really care about authenticity but I've eaten a lot of hummus. And their basic hummus is the the best I've ever had... and I've never tasted anything that compares to their falafel. Super sweet staff. I wish I were in San Mateo more often!<//text>< rating>

Just a simple menu where every single thing on it is delicious. The pitas are perfect, the shawarma is perfectly spiced and neither overly moist or dry, the falafel is delectable, and even the chopped salad is great.

You are doing yourself a disservice by not eating here, it's really something else.</Text>

I really enjoyed the food. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food I got. Really well season chicken, great hummus, ingredients felt great, fresh. I however just didn’t feel welcomed when I walked in. I felt like the worker was forcing herself to take my order. I understand sometimes you might be tired and most cheapos don’t tip but I don’t like to go to a business and feel I’m not welcomed to be there. Regardless of this I will go back and recommend you do too.< /Review>

Extremely limited selection but everything there is well executed. Most of their distress have cilantro so be aware if you don't like it/are allergic. Portions are big: 2 dishes fed 2 adults and 2 kids with some leftovers.<//Text>

<Review>Food is good but portions are small. Hummus tastes homemade which is great! I wish they would reduce their footprint and lay off the plastic use -- utensils, plastic cups, and sauces in plastic containers when its being served on a dish -- why make more garbage then you have to?</Review>< response>

Small menu that's done consistently well. The pita is amazing, hummus is great, falafel is always cooked fresh -- never stiff from sitting around. Brisk service, not a ton of seats in a very casual setting.</text>

<text>I really try not to go back to the same place twice, but I was in the area and remembered how good this place good and wanted the hummus that I couldn't get last time because I couldn't eat 2 meals.

So I came back and got the hummus with ground beef. It's comes with pita and it's pretty much a meal in itself. The hummus is so smooth, the ground beef is flavorful and delicious and there's something about that green hot sauce that is super spicy, but its SO good!

Overall, I just kept ripping up my pita and scooping some beef and hummus and repeating. It's so good! I'll probably end up back there again.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

Has kabobs, combination plates with tasty Mediterranean food at reasonable prices in a casual setting. Service is quick and friendly. Parking is on street fronting parking meters and may be scarce as it is in Downtown San Mateo. Do not Park in Draeger's parking lot as they will cite.<//Review>

Absolute great tasting Falafel, Hummus and Shawarma, and the small-chopped salad is sooooo tasty. Place is rather small but the food portions are big, it's great for a quick lunch or dinner. Prices are very reasonable (pita bread dish is under $10). I asked for my dish to be made a specific way and they had no problem making it in the way I asked with no extra cost. I will be coming back to this place every time I am in the area and recommend it to all my friends.</Review>

I go there all the time because they got top quality pita bread that is just so hard to find in America. Hummus I great and I highly recommend the chicken schnitzel in a pita, however you must get it with the grape juice because it compliments the meals so well bit to mention it is from the home country of Israel.<//Review>

The hummus is so creamy and so fresh. It rivals the quality of Oren's Hummus in Palo Alto. I like getting the one that comes with ground beef. My only complaint would be that they need to include more pita bread when packing hummus orders for takeout. It's just not enough!< /review>

Worst service we ever had!!! Mike took our order like he was doing us a favor, without even looking at us and when we discovered our hummus is stone cold (were we come from itsi served slightly warm), we asked if they can heat it up a bit. They looked at us like we fell from the moon and said they can't and that is how they serve it, extremely impatiently. So we asked for take away (so we could heat it up) the lady made a face and again acted like she's doing us a faver, and when she didn't give us enough boxes I asked for another one and she responded very aggressively again....
Before we left I went to Mike and quitly, as to not make a big deal, I told him the service was not a good experience for us and I'm not sure why they acted that way, to that he responded in a very loud voice "what is your deal lady? If u don't like it go to Chipotle"... I feel very bad (not used to strangers being that aggressive) so I went to our car but then I decided that I will not let this slide. So I went back in and asked for his name and again he acted like I'm some crazy person... And yeld " what is your deal???" I asked again, quitly and he yeld "what is your name?!" I told him and then he said his name is Erik... I also askedathe people around if they gotgtge same "qulity" service, and they all said they have and that they are socked by how these 2 acted. What a BAD EXPERIENCE!!!
If someone knows the owner I would love to talk to him. These people will kill his business<//Review>

I love stopping here for a quick pita filled with falafels.  It is what I always order.  The falafels are always light and airy with just enough crisp on the outside.<//review>

<text>Love the shawarma sandwich - you can ask for extra saucy (if you like more spicy and juicy, but not in a chilli hot way) too :) There is also a great off-menu kid's plate option which consists of a small schnitzel, fries, pita bread, hummus and olives/pickles which my four-year-old really enjoys.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Tiny menu but we loved the food both times that we were there! I could come here just for their pita which is unlike any other pita I've ever eaten : soft, fluffy, done just right and always fresh and warm. It was a bit disappointing that the only shawarma they serve is chicken but then we were really happy with what we got in terms of taste, quality and portion (honestly though, it was more like curry than shawarma). Between both visits we've almost sampled the entire menu. The tastes and styles are slightly different from other 'mediterranean' places. Come here for a great tasting, affordable and healthy meal! One star off for the limited seating options :(</Text><rate>4<//rate>< UserId.>

A cute little mom&pop mediterranean joint in the Hillsdale neighborhood. I've tried their falafel and the chicken in a pita sandwich and both were amazing. The best part about this pita is the stuffing. The ratio of the veggies, chicken and sauce was just perfect and it was also well distributed across the entire pita which makes the sandwich way better than others.<//text>

The pita from this place is so thick and chewy.  I have a hard time on not to stuff myself with pitas.

My company would order lunch from here and I had to break my vow of avoid grains for these pitas.</review>

The ladies that were there were so nice and joking around with us the whole time. I got my pedicure done with regular nail polish and 1 week later it's still perfect. They polished my daughter's nails which made her so happy. My sister got her acrylic nails done and although she is picky when it comes to her nails she loved how they  came out.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<rate>1</rate><text>This place has a sign that says they accept card in their window ....i made plans to get my nails and toes done here so I van have them ready to celebrate my birthday....so i planned my day and gave myself a window of time to run errands, get my nails done and be back in time to make dinner for my husband..i walked into the salon and sat down waiting for the lady to call me up to a chair and she just looked at me. Not one word and gave me a dirty look. I then got up and looked at the nail polish that they had. Then there on the counter I happened to see a sign the says cash only...and it's right next to a machine for cards. I asked if the machine is not working and she said that they don't accept card. That the machine is just there. I was like "seriously? You don't take card?" She gave me another dirty look and said no. So I walked out... she didn't need to be rude. I wanted to try that place out because I had read some good reviews and they said the price was decent...but I'd rather pay more somewhere else than deal with rude people...and ones that don't take card but have signs up saying they accept card...< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

We went there earlier this week with my mother and had a horrible experience. We went in for a gel manicure. While my mother was soaking off her old gel nail polish they kept rushing us to choose the color. they hadn't even begun working on the nails and were asking why we weren't ready for our color choice. I was sitting next to my mother and they kept insisting the colors were the same on all the color samples. I was trying to show my mom a color that WASN'T on her palette and they kept saying talking over us and saying the colors were the same and laughing at us. My mother's polish application was horrible. She completely went over the edges, left them super thick attempting to cover the mess ups, and thicker on different parts of the same nail. We would ask her and she kept getting upset saying it was the way my mother had her nail placed while drying. Please note we've been getting gel manicures for years. She didn't clean the edges and on the ones she did, the gel dried on the side, giving it a chance to lift on the side. She was very rude the whole time and did her job as if she was rushed. We were the only ones there when we got there... we don't usually write reviews but this was a really really bad experience. save yourself the headache and bad service.<//text>

Been living in BayArea for past 13 years and could not find an affordable and quality place for haircut. Got lucky for my first visit that Alex was taking walk-ins. Best haircut ever!!! I set recurring appointment with them now and I don't have to wait for a sec. get there on time, get my nice haircut and out in 30 min. If you appreciate quality and want to get a professional haircut I would recommend this Barber Shop.</Text>

It was a long wait and a bit of miscommunication while we waited but let me tell you about this barber shop: it's great. It has a vibrant and chatty atmosphere with lovely men working there. I didn't see any bad cuts or shaves while we were there. I feel bad because I didn't get the name of the guy who did my daughter's hair but he made her feel very comfortable. My daughter is only 10, people. She went in for a nape shave and design and came out a very happy girl. You won't regret going here.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been coming here for the past few years and it’s been amazing. Great place to come in and get an amazing haircut. Make an appointment online and you’ll be set. 10/10 highly recommended for everyone. All the people giving bad reviews complaining about doing walk ins, just make an appointment or just wait lol.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fc72e4f9b233f:0x68a649bf4484bca3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Writing this review to help out one of my favorite small businesses. I’ve been coming to this place for 8 years now. Always been professional, always provided a high quality hair-cut, and the value has been top tier for years! The busyness is a sign of the quality and value of their service. For newcomers, I’d recommend booking an appointment on Booksy (check early and often)! Or arrive real early on walk-in days to get your name on the iPad. You won’t regret coming here — the best barbershop in the Bay Area!< /text>

I decoded to give this place a shot as my normal barber no longer is working due to the covid-19 pandemic. I had showed up first thing saturday morning for a haircut since Saturdays are walk in services days. I arrived well before opening time as to get a decent spot and be out within a reasonable time as I dont need much aside from having my hair shortened, almost like a buzz cut but a bit longer. As I waited I was passed up repedidly. I was the second person waiting to get inside and was completely ignored by the people running the place in favor of others that arrived after me. They even addressed me when the person infront if me had been taken in but conveniently forgot about me when, what I can only presume, normal customers showed up and proceeded to be chummy with them.

Tldr: if you're looking for a new barber because of covid, look elsewhere, this place was unprofessional as all places and dismissive of new patrons in favor of their normal crowd.</text>

Fabian is my usual barber, as I like to stick to one person to always cut my hair. Although, I could honestly say that I'd feel comfortable with any of the barbers here, as they are all masters at their craft. I recommend you book an appointment as walk-ins can get crazy. Like I said, it's a great barbershop and they are really popular and book out about 2 weeks in advance.< /review></record>

Great shop. Very skilled barber. They listen good and suggest better. I've been to many barbers in Fremont, not all but many, and this one stands out way better than others. JR (one of the barbers) is awesome!<//text>

Really bad vibes and no customer care. Kept making me wait , then kept adding delays even when the barbers were available , they did not take me . They just have a don’t care attitude. Won’t trust them  with my hair with that attitude.< /text>

We can’t give you special privilege and let you cut in front of others. The other barbers were not available, they were waiting for their next appointment to come in. We cannot take you in between customers, that will make us late to our next customer. We do strive and have great customer service in a good vibe environment.'}< /Response>

This place came highly recommended in a mom's group for boys haircuts. I didn't get the name of the guy but he did an awesome job. My son got several compliments by strangers that same day. Bring cash since they don't use Square for cards.<//Text>

Professional, detailed hair cuts. Parking lot can be tight for very large cars. Word of caution: MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! My first time there, I paid the price of being a walk in. Take 5 minutes, give them a call and make an appointment - save yourself the headache. Cash only, closest ATM is in the 7-11 across the street.<//text>

<Review>I keep getting the cut that they think I should have, but not what i describe. First time was alright. This time...  I think I regret.

Great vibe. Good guys. Really. Just the wrong shop for me. Good place for most.<//Review>< pics>

It was my first time at this place... I didn't make an appointment but thankfully they take walk-ins. I was attended by JR not sure about name.. It was really good place for Hair cut... I love the staff and will definitely come again and again... Thanks for a good hair cut.
Just one suggestion if you are planning to go first time please make an appointment..</Text>

<text>Came in to get my 3 year old a hair cut after a lot of horrible ones had been done in the past. Had to wait maybe 25min (be sure to check for walk-in days), and was seen by JR who exceeded my expectations! He was very patient with my 3 year old, and actually worked with his hair for a great looking cut. Can't thank him enough and we will be returning.< /text><date>1521569737995</date><GmapID>0x808fc72e4f9b233f:0x68a649bf4484bca3< /GmapID>< rate>

Nobody else was able to cut my hair the way I wanted, but Alex did a great job. In fact the cut I got, I was able to model my hair any way I wanted.
You should try it once.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Very picky about my hair. Can't believe I've been going to stylists instead of a good barber. Tried a completely new hair cut for first time in years. My barber did an awesome job. Even while I was waiting and watching the other barbers I can tell they are all very good.<//Review>

<user_id>117809528721329212408</user_id><review>Best Barbers in the East Bay. No question. Only thing you should worry about is the wait. The wait can exceed 3 hours, this is not an exaggeration. To give you an idea I have arrived in the morning, written my name on their list (25th), gone home, ate lunch, cleaned the house, showered, washed my car, and returned to still have a 30 minute wait (Do not miss your turn, if your name is called twice and you fail to hear your name on both occasions you will be cut from the list).  Also WARNING the shop does have specific closing times, but they will stop accepting individuals if the wait list has become too long. Come in early, leave early.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

<review>The food was delicious.  The salad and clam chowder were especially good.  The chowder had a subtle smoky flavor.  Great service and a place to eat outside too.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfLCNclzDOzkXz5-arBUj86PNlA9L4LS93lI2S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP516y3h8qGNkrLW-WCRbENm-2c_px7BKGpvy7j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

You wouldn't get 1starfrom me if I can.
Falsely advertised. I dont know any restaurant,better yet an individual who can confuse what a shrimp cocktail is. I ordered one on my lunch break and I recieved LITERALLY a little Dixie cup with cabbage on the bottom and 3 or 4 little raw shrimp.thats all. Ooooo....and it was 13 dollars.</text>

<Text>Great food. Not Hawaiian at all except for pineapple on some items. The burgers are yummy. The fish and chips are yummy. The shrimp is yummy. That's all I've tried but so good I keep coming back. My friend said they had 1 bad time there out of 30. I have had 0 of 20. Try a few things here and you'll find something you love. It is a little pricey though.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ecf0d33c513ca3:0x17ca11a8a73834ba< /GmapID></record>

Very good fish and chips most of the stuff I've had here has been really good Yoder's very pleasant it does have a bathroom and they had the TV on so had five or six that usually watch news depending on the day sometimes they watch Spanish soccer we're other Spanish channels but usually there's an English show going on on the other TV usually it's News Channel or informational Channel<//review>

Best fish and chips in slo. Sand dabs sometimes available are amazing. The wraps are awesome too. The owner is almost always there and you are well taken care of< /Review>

This place is fantastic!  My first time.  Their Thursday night special was highly recommended.  A Filet mignon burger.  The filet was cooked to perfection and very tender! I give it two 👍👍 up.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful.<//text>

A decent place to grab lunch. Almost everything is fried - so baware of that. Their wraps are decent and their clam strips and fish 'n chips are good. Stick with the basics and you'll be good.

Don't go here for a healthy meal. Go here for a decent quick lunch.<//Review>

Smells good in here. Menu looks expensive. We ordered strawberry smoothies and we're disappointed. $6 for mediocre tasting small, yes $6 for about 10oz smoothie.
I'll try the food, if I don't just keep eating next doors Mexican food.< /Review>

I understand the rent is probably high, hence the expensive prices, but to charge a "dine out" fee is ridiculous!
Look at it this way.... 15,000 people "dine out" from this affiliation in one year.  That is $10,000 annually!!!  A cheap gouge to every "dine out" person in my opinion.
Mario the owner, is not the most friendly and needs to work on his customer service standards.
The food is not bad, but going to In&Out would be cheaper and taste better.< /review>

The breakfast burrito was weak. 10 bucks for mostly potatoes is a rip off. I had to open the burrito to pick out the bits and pieces of egg and bacon. I threw out the tortilla because I didn't like the smell (too processed.) This left me dissatisfied and disappointed the rest of the day.< /review>

Saturday Morning Farmers Market. Three Babes Bakery Key Lime Pie.
I spent the vast majority of my life in central florida and traveled yearly to key west florida and I will commit floridian blasphemy right here on google maps and go on record saying "San Francisco based women and minority owned Three Babes Bakeshop does, in fact, bake a more delicious key lime pie than any key lime pie that has graced my palate on the caribbean island getaway of Key West, Florida".
Price per slice: $7
Price per pie: $45

PSA: SATURDAY FERRY BUILDING FARMERS MARKET ALLOWS YOU TO UTILIZE CAL-FRESH BENEFITS FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT HOT FOOD AND FLOWERS. Additionally, they give you $10 free for use on fruits and vegetables only.< /Review>

You must visit this place. There are many activities to do, for example take the ferry to Sausalito, visit the Market Inside the building and if you go to SF in holidays, you can enjoy the fireworks in New Year< /Text>

<Text>Lovey building with some interesting history that can be read in the entrance. Visited the building twice during our visit in October, the first was on Saturday morning for the farmers market and then again the following day for breakfast. The Farmers Market that is every Sunday and Tuesday morning is well worth a visit, the produce is amazing and there are a lot of stalls to buy food and drinks from.< /Text>< Pics>

When ever I am in San Francisco I come here.  I enjoy the shops and the piers around the Ferry Building.  I will also sometimes take the train from SFO airport during long layovers.  Walking along the bay is so very nice.<//text>

Not too big for the less mobile people, but contains a decent variety of food stalls and shops in addition to the actual ferry ports. The farmers markets are a fun place to meet and have coffee as the morning weather on the Embarcadero is generally exquisite most of the year. Besides the fresh produce there are multiple vendors offering prepared foods. One of the unique experiences to see in San Francisco on Saturday mornings 8a-2p (also Tu/Th 10-2) and relatively easy by public transit. One of those places where locals and tourists mix.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Attention all foodies: this delectable attraction needs to be at the top of your San Francisco to-do list. The Ferry Building Marketplace is a public food market that features a variety of food stalls that act as small restaurants, snack stops and grocery stores. Here you can find everything from staples, such as seafood, burgers, Mexican food and plenty of coffee, to a Japanese delicatessen, empanada stand, nut shop and a cheese and dairy bar.

Many travelers who stopped by the Ferry Building Marketplace visited multiple times during their San Francisco trip. Visitors were impressed with the amount, variety and overall quality of eats available on-site. Though there are formal restaurants available, some visitors say the best strategy is to pick up a to-go meal and enjoy it along the scenic waterfront. And if you're not one for lines, don't come on the weekends.

You can reach the marketplace via the Embarcadero BART/Muni Station and several public buses lines. Parking is also available near the marketplace. The marketplace is open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m with slightly different hours on the weekends. Restaurants and stores, however, maintain varied hours. The farmers market welcomes shoppers from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Owner and staff very nice. She did not do my pedi or mani but the 2 employees who did Diane and Tina? did a great job. The mani and pedi costed $63.00. I tipped both employees 1 2 dollars and 1 3 dollars. I think tip is included in service. I will return for another mani and pedi. Maybe they will have a weekly special in the future or senior day for folks 60 and over. Staff did a great job. I normally travel to Oakland but I will call this shop home. All the employees were doing outstanding worked. I was impressed. Not cheap.. I didn't pay this much at Wal mart they had combinations or specials. I like this shop much better...<//text>

not satisfied with my nails. first red flag was that the lady didn’t push down my cuticles and then the other red flag was that she used actual scissors instead of an actual nail clipper. She also made me bleed. I asked for marble but i don’t know what she did because what i got is not marble. at all. it was just all bad. she also didn’t put top coat on my right hand but put it on my left hand. so unprofessional and a mess</text>

Next day nail broke and glue came off another three days later. Over priced and not done right. $40 for full what a joke and she had nerve to charge me $30 for fill. Gel also done at that no other special things done.< /text>

The 2nd time, my GEL polish was discolorong and peeling off. The 3rd time was the last time EVER. The lady doing my nails was bleeding while doing my nails and some of the blood from her finger kept getting on my fingers. I told her she’s bleeding and she ignored me and continued on my nails. I kept telling her and she got mad because I kept telling her she’s bleeding and it’s getting on my hands. I got up to wash my hands and ask if someone else can do my nails, the owner went to the back and was hiding. So gross.

I have had a couple negative experiences there with one tech. She cut my nails the length i wanted then filed them done to almost half that length. Then I met Jean. She fixed the womans mistake and ever since then Jean has been my girl! She trys to make conversation and makes you feel comfortable. Never an awkward silnce with her. ALWAYS remembers what you like and ALWAYS does a great job.<//review>

< Review>
So the first time I came here they were nice at first and even complimented me, but when I was getting my nails done I asked for gel and they claimed it was. I got in my car thinking my nails were dry and they smeared. I came back in and told them and they still acted clueless about what Gel polish was and how soon it was supposed to dry until I got a lil upset then they said ok ok we get it for you, and then did. Today I decided to come back just for a simple pedicure since it's near my home. I asked if she could make my lukewarm water a little hotter. She acted like she did and I just took my feet out of the water and sat them on top because it was that uncomfortable. When she seen my feet on the top she made it hotter and said ok it's hot now. Why is it that hard to get good service. Plus insulting me asking me why do I look different this time. Um I obviously don't have on makeup. I'm not coming back again.<//Review>

<review>Don't do it. They use to have an amazing reputation. Unfortunately ever since the pandemic it has gone completely downhill. I have no complaints about our child’s teacher. However I do have concerns on how the administration (not the board) is translating guidelines to restrict these kids from interacting with one another. It has more of a prison feel than a warm safe environment. Do yourself a favor and look for another school. Our child does not do well with change or we would remove them from this school. These kids need a sense of normalcy and they do not have it here.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

It is a great school, but instead of concrete, some grass PLEASE. I'm very afraid of cracking my skull.</review>

This is by far the BEST SCHOOL I've gone to. My only suggestion is to add some grass. I was once known when I was in third grade as the the girl who tripped and fell with a puddle of blood. The grades 3,4, and 6 knew. I think they should add the grass is so that doesn't happen to me or anyone who goes to this school.< /review>

This was my first year working here, i had a great year! I enjoyed getting to know most of the students by name, and the middle school teachers were amazing/supportive. The admin staff always try their very best at answering questions, responding to many parents, and going over and beyond! As an aide here, I will say the school (like every school) has improvements to make BUT I really enjoyed my time here. Shout out to some of the best: Priscilla, Shannon, Susie, Timarie, Al, Kathy for making this year amazing for our students ❤️

I think this school is a pretty good school but some students have been posting what they believe and there ratings, and if they are not good ones teachers would make kids change there reviews to better ones which can make some people fell the reviews are not that trustable. Then one other not so good thing is that the soap in the student bathrooms are basically just water or so flushed out that it is just slightly colored water. Over all I think this school has pretty good teachers and staff and the school is always pretty clean because of our amazing janitors. This school also has two different language options for this middle school Spanish and mandarin.< /Review>

< Review>
AMAZING school! Our school is one of the most diverse and academically motivated schools in the Sacramento area. I have been in the school for over 4 years. I have had the best experiences here so I highly recommend bringing your children here! Our school has even got on the news and got one student into Stanford! The teachers are very kind and passionate. Some teachers, like Mrs. Bryson has an open door policy so on other periods you can visit her and talk to her about something that may be happening. I am still a student but I completely and utterly believe this school is the best in California lol. Have a good day and if you do come to the school say hi to me, my name is Braydon! :)< /Review>

<Review>Although the school has been improving, it is overall a horrible place to leave your kids for the day. There's a rule that you can't run at recess, which is absolutely ridiculous. The children need to release their energy, and the awful yard duties are preventing them from doing this. I think the Elementary program is fine, it's actually pretty good. The Middle school, however, is what I have a problem with. Even though they got rid of it, Summit was the worst thing that ever happened to Gateway. It's a trash program that's essentially just an excuse for the teachers not to teach. In math last year, I got a C because of this terrible program. After transferring from Gateway and using a traditional program, my grade is now an A, and I'm excelling.  Send your kids to WSCA, it has fantastic teachers, you're kids will love it.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The yard duties are sweet and they treat us like their own children. They love and are willing to help them get to their goals. They are preparing us as students for a future and opportunitys that not a lot of students around the world get. Like every school this one has its downs but there arent any that come to mind. Moving schools my 8th grade year was really hard but when I got here everyone just had there arms open and wanted to be friends. I now understand what a community looks like.

<text>Shameful neglect of the needs of some faculty members. I know of several individuals who have suffered both physical and psychological damage owing to an utterly irrational work load, and the fact that the administration knows this but cares more about it's pockets than the well-being of it's employees. I don't have the funds to file a lawsuit for misconduct towards faculty, but if I did I probably would. If any administrative leaders read this, I beg of you, decide to be better than this. Find out what certain employees need and help them so they can help you. Poor administration causes people's lives to suffer well beyond what you realize. And in case you're wondering, I am not an employee. If I was, I would be having this conversation in person.<//text><Date>1549699211971<//Date><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

This school has a good education program at least for when I went there they did. Besides education, this school is not very effective with the kids. Especially they Yard Duty people. They can be pretty mean and same with some of the teachers. But most teachers that I had were pretty nice.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>My husband and I are parents of 4 children who are students attending this school. One of which is on the spectrum and special needs. Though we (our son, his teachers, school staff, my husband and I) have had a lot of difficult days and many I.E.P./school meetings...overall, I think this school deserves the highest rating possible (which on here would be a 5). The teachers we have had so far are amazing (for all 4 of our kids) and you can tell they want the best for their students and genuinely care about each child's progress.

R.A.G. (Rocklin Academy Gateway) has received a lot of negative publicity in the last couple years over following the law by keeping the identity and privacy of a transgender Kindergarten student protected. When we saw the news about a transgender ceremony and book reading, we too were initially concerned, especially since we had a Kindergartner attending there. We were able to sort out, to the best of our knowledge, what actually transpired without specific details on whom or when that the ceremony was the normal Kindergarten graduation ceremony, not a transgender reveal. The book, albeit perhaps not advisable to read to 5 and 6 year olds who may or may not understand what gender is yet...was on the approved reading list and brought by the student; not specifically selected by the teacher. However, personal opinions on what 'could' have been done differently aside...even in the midst of heightened media attention, threats, controversy and adverse student body responses...the school maintained their stance and followed state law. Even if you disagree with the political or social controversy you can be certain of this fact...they will protect your child, your family's identity and provide a safe environment for the student NO MATTER WHAT. I respect that and applaud them for their composure through the entire ordeal. We NEED MORE SCHOOLS LIKE THIS ONE!</Review>< pictures>

Literally this school is crazy. They hand out referrals like they’re trying to get rid of the papers. One of the staff members grabbed a kid’s arm and literally left a mark. Some kids are possibly getting suspended for the principal following them to the dollar store BEFORE SCHOOL and aren’t punishing them equally. Kids get trash throw at them and racial slurs are thrown around all day right in front of the teachers and they don’t even care. 10/10 would never recommend<//Review>

The yard duties here are always punishing kids for very crazy reasons. Like giving affection and hugging other students.The are also very strict about giving referrals for the smallest reasons and are always blaming kids for things they didn't do. They have a very weird way of teaching kids the things they need to learn, and don't do a great job of it. There are a few good teachers who know how to teach, but most don't do anything. Plus, they don't give teachers a long prep-period, so they are always late on returning assignments and don't have much time to get the things they need to get done to be ready for class. The classrooms are always filthy covered in paper and food wrappers and rarely get cleaned properly. They  never fill the bathrooms with paper towels, soap, and toilet paper. I would not recommend this school for your kids, but there high school is one of the best high schools you could attend.<//review>

I DID NOT  SIGN UP FOR THAT SCHOOL TO HAVE THE YARD DUTIES TO MAKE US CLEAN UP TABLES WHILE IM SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING OUTSIDE. If you want to send your child to a depressing and overall immature school,  then you do you. AND substitutes taught better than the actual teacher!  The principal and staff pick their favorites and have totally biased opinions. They just hand out referrals like it means nothing. Do not send you children to this school unless you would like to send them to a boot-camp.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This school does not respect the innocence of a child and the freedom of the people. The basic function of the school is to teach reading and writing well and to do well. From this it is taught other areas of education, solidifies and forms a person capable of solving problems. When you go to work hard and leave your child in the choice you expect in the future to have an intelligent and competent person, a scientist or even an athlete, a warrior who in the future will defend the country, but today, these are not the biggest concerns in California . It is cowardly for you to pick up a child who barely knows how to read and want to teach questions to be taught by parents at home, you are invading the role of parents, who should have the freedom to approach this subject or even address. What they do is cowardly and immoral. In california there is no such beloved liberty. God save the US and God save the world from the hands of these psychopaths who want our children to grow up with a mental mess.< /review>

I have a friend here who got a tech violation for talking to another student on her school computer and got it taken away by the school. It's been about a month since this happened and everyday she struggles to do her work because she doesn't have the resources other students have. Typically when a student gets a tech violation, their computer is taken away for a day and they get a refferal, but in this case, they completely took it away and was left in the dark about when she can get it back. It seems completely unprofessional and this school preaches about their comunication with the students but do things like this.< /text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>The school itself is fine. Nice facility, sort of dirty, but it is a middle school, what do you expect. The education is really good, most of the teachers are nice. However, this year, I was being bullied. And when I say bullied, I do not mean the petty insults and taunts that most attention seeking kids call bullying, but actuall physical agression and harassment, namecalling on a daily basis, and even some stealing of lunches. I told the staff about this several times, and each time the response was "Thank you, we will 'look into it.'" Ridiculous. After many more incidents, I would alert the staff again, and they would "resolve" the problem by giving the bully a stern warning. This, as you would assume, did not help. Finally, after a public freakout in the middle of class, where said bully began yelling at me, did the staff feel that it was time to give our friend a major referall and suspention -for one day. That worked just perfectly, because the next day, the bully marched up to me, referall in hand, and said "I hope you're ****ing happy." and proceeded to tell everyone the story of how they simply called me a snitch, and I went and snitched on them for nothing, painting me as the bad guy. The school's discipline system is so messed up. They take it so easy on the kids who deserve to be punnished. The normal punnishement is a "Quiet Lunch" which I have seen kids trying to get, so they can spend time with they're friends. Again, the school is fine, but If your student has a history of bullying or being bullied, this is NOT the school for you. BEWARE!!!!<//review>< Pics>

The school also needs to make sure kids are quieter at rallies because one time I had a headache for the rest of the day because of the loudness. Also, some kids hate me because I am DIFFERENT because I am not annoying and I don't play fortnite all the time. Overall, you should ban everything fortnite from school.

<Date>1556509617982<//Date><Review>The school is fine in academics, but I have two big problems with the school. Firstly, hot lunch. This isn’t an issue grades TK through 6th have to deal with, but boy oh boy it’s problematic for everyone else. There is a form that is supposed to be filled out by 9AM, which isn’t always easy because you might not have to opportunity or you may even forget, but it’s just a wimpy google form that some of the time doesn’t even work. Occasionally when I go the form to get hot lunch, I’m met with a nice big error screen telling me that something’s broken, so I end up not filling out the form. This leads to the one of the biggest issues with hot lunch: chef. Chef has it OUT for kids that didn’t fill out the hot lunch form, in which he will express his unstoppable rage by giving these kids less food then they’re paying for. $4.50 for a 1 and a 1/2 inch wide pizza, while kids who fill out the hot lunch form get slices that are a size of a fourth of a medium to large pizza? (obviously it isn’t just pizza that is being lowered in serving size in this situation, I’m just using it as an example) If I’m paying that much for a hot lunch, I should be getting just as much as everyone else. I think I’ve whined enough about hot lunch, so I’m gonna move on to my next problem: Everyone is going to see this and think “oh he just wants to play games in school” but iboss creates a much bigger problem. I am currently sitting at my desk at home trying to do homework, and have been waiting for 45 minutes trying to use my chrome book, but I’m stuck on an iboss screen saying “please wait as your location is detected”. I’ve tried resetting my chrome book, closing the pages, opening new ones, but to no avail. I can’t do my homework and it’s not even a sliver of my fault. Iboss just needs to be deleted. Thanks for listening to my complaints and I hope kids coming to the school later have it better.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

As a new kid in this school, I enjoy the school here. Overall, I like the fact of the absurd amounts of tests in the plp (don't hate), but I dislike the fact that these don't really count to your grade (as I've heard), unlike projects (In which some tests are harder than the actual topic) which make up most of your grade.</Review>

<text>I feel like the overall education here really isn't that bad... teachers here are not bad, they help us thrive in the scholastic portion, but the staff here is quite questionable. The middle school principal here is not very helpful, she favors people and takes sides with NO proof. I have had two encounters with her and so far made no progress with her in any WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. She never helps us in our situations or even makes compromises. She takes ONE side, never sees the full picture, and gets innocent people into trouble when they did nothing wrong. It's unreasonable and unfair. Yard duties here are scary and harsh. WE. ARE. IN. MIDDLE. SCHOOL. WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES.*jesus*< /text>< name>

I would NEVER let a child attend a school such as this. Parents get your children out before this school is brain washing these kids and reading them all books about sex between partners of every gender.
This school is a concerning place along with the staff. I have to wonder what kind of Sociopath is running this place? Parents save your children and get them out NOW.< /Review>

I went here since it opened, so far I think it's kinda meh. The teachers are mostly nice, though sometimes there are some mean ones, and the curriculum is pretty ok too. The only problems are that some of the yard duties are not very kind and some kids there don't care for the rules causing you to waste lots of time waiting for your teacher to stop yelling at them for the 20th time. Sometimes I feel bad for the teachers at the school for having to deal with that, if only people would just listen and then joke around at recess or something. The worst thing about those kids are that they think they are cool for doing that, they don't care about the rules at all and it ends with about a fourth of your entire day being your teachers trying to get everyone to be quiet. Other than that, pretty nice place. I was able to make quite a few great friends there. I guess you should send your kids there if you want to?<//Text>

It’s like North Korean version of Turnstone. Don’t take your kids to Gateway unless if you want to torture your kids. Very strict and awful.

Turnstone’s better</review>

< review>
Our child has been attending since this campus opened. While the school has had a normal amount of growing pains (like traffic issues) overall we are so pleased with the school. The school is quick to accommodate special needs. The administration is very responsive and takes safety and bullying issues seriously.
I volunteer in class and see first hand how well they tailor the instruction to each child's individual skill level. They arrange the grade levels around "hubs" or flexible use areas. This allows them to shift students for every lesson (math, spelling etc) and each teacher takes a class-sized group of similar skill level. Within the groups they break into three smaller skill-level groups. Each child's skill level is adjusted throughout the year as needed. I am so impressed with how well the kids learn this way!
Additionally, their curriculum is impressive. They use a curriculum that "wraps around" each year. So kids will see the same subject matter to greater depths each year (like the human body, or immigration). We feel so lucky we made it in the lottery.

Recent press attention, much of it inaccurate,  and the opening of a middle school seems to have drawn some commentary here. Ha! But in terms of 1. Rigorous Academics 2. Safe school 3. Responsive Administration... I'm incredibly pleased.<//review>

<Text>Rocklin Academy Gateway is an ok school. This school has a lot of good teachers, for example Lister, Lopez and Bryson. They help you when you need something and they encourage students to always try their best. And then there is also some teachers, and yard duties that upset students fairly often, and they take a while to get used to. (I'm not going to name names) If you read the other reviews you will see  other comments with different opinions on the PLP. There are things I like about the PlP and things I don't like. One thing I do like is how organized everything is, but on the other hand I don't like how stressful it is, for example history for the 8th graders. I also don't like how when you take a certain test and its for a particular subject let's say spanish all of the words on the test are in spanish but you don't always understand what you are being asked to do because you only learned certain words for what was on the resources, and you don't have a spanish speaking teacher for your homeroom. Bottom line is that a lot of things about this school are frustrating.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1522985343434< /Time>< gmap_id>

This school is now a circus, with the transgender fiasco, the yard duties not doing their job, the buggy plp program, and forcing kids to change their reviews, I'm glad I left but at the same time Im glad I went there because of how much I had learned. I'm just sad to see what was once a great school go downhill so rapidly. Take your kids here if you want them to learn a lot at the cost of being distracted by all controversy.

< Review>
The teachers here are forcing us to change our reviews to positive reviews since of all the buzz about the trans topics. The plt is ok except for the absurd amount of tests on it. Im probably one of the few people that actually adapted to it. Most people cant even pass the CI goal ( 90 percent of students are behind in the plt). All in all, its just a experiment gone wrong.< /Review>

this school is terrible. the teachers dont care about their students, they act like everyone is the same age. i used to attend but decided that another year in this school wasn’t worth my time. they constantly change their curriculum and never can stay with one curriculum for more than one year. DO NOT SEND YOUR KID/s HERE FOR YOU WOULD BE WASTING YOUR CHILD’s TIME< /text>

<text>🇱🇰 SRI LANKA
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
Lamprais are a complex cacophony of ingredients, based around rice and wrapped in a banana leaf for cooking. The chicken lamprais ($13.49) is a packet that also contains a hard-boiled egg, sambol made with fried shrimp, eggplant, and pineapple curry. The meat has been marinated for what seems like forever, and the rice is simmered in broth, a combination that gives you such different pleasures with each bite.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpJ9bPWaraI3Vuu8tDIcd-QRj4dK9ybVgiTiHG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFHyzo54wx_QN0I0_dbBfG0g50qenosWvTj-B5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHuUq1ihVaPkJjVUegyz41oeXcQpgoi_QnQCze=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Good tasty food. Reasonably priced. Owner is very friendly. Even with a short notice she gets the food ready. Portion are very generous.
She hasn't let me down.
I am a regular customer of hers for many many years.</Review>

Despite the austere interior, the food coming from the kitchen is nothing short of amazing. I tried the Hoppers combo plate and loved every bite. Each of the three entrees possessed a richness and depth of flavor I wasn't expecting. I found the crispy edges and softer spongy center of the Hoppers to be the perfect accompaniment.<//Text>

We had Lunch Packet (similar to tamale but made w rice & veggies & wrapped in banana leaf) and Pol Roti (bread + side dishes). We chose sambal (addictive spicy minced goodness), lentil curry, jackfruit. Everything was flavorful & did not taste greasy! Will be eating their food regularly going forward!< /Text><user>102713944480996023946< /user>< GmapID>

Neither of us had tried Sri Lankan food before, so when we crossed the strip-mall parking lot to the unassuming little restaurant almost tucked away in the corner, we had no idea at all what to expect. The simple, no-frills dining room and long warming tray display of unfamiliar dishes along the front next to the register told us that any longevity for this business would rely entirely on the food. The aromas were incredible, though, so we had instantly high hopes.

Our hopes were slightly dashed when we heard that none of the mutton dishes were still on the menu, but Raz ordered one beef and one veg dish from those on display with some rice, and I put in an order for Godamba Roti, and asked for suggestions on which meat and veg curry to pair it with. Godamba Roti appears to be a crepe-like flatbread that has an indescribably complex flavor. Alas, I did not write down any of the names of the sides and curries, and I couldn't even remember what I'd actually ordered when it came to the table. All I did know was that I'd never had anything else quite like it. Every single dish we had defied explanation, being simply too rich with complex and complementary flavors. One thing was certain, though, when the staff promised a dish was spicy, it pleasantly packed on the scovilles. Rice N' Spice was definitely one of those places we would come back halfway across the country to try again.</review>

Authentic Sri Lankan Food. Friendly staff. Place is nice and clean. I mostly enjoy  the "Lunch Packet" with a variety of authentic SL curry items. Although I find Lamprais is not that original, I would recommend trying it.<//Text>

So I was recommended to come here. The banana leaf is awesome a cool presentation. I wanted chicken and got jack fruit instead. I wanted Vegetables any kind but was told that they were no good. So I left with rice and jackfruit. The rice was good but I was disappointed.</Text>

Authenticity 100%! Great selection of food and desserts too. Just two things to keep in mind: their regular spice level is quite spicy! Ask for mild or less spicey. Chicken may have bones too, so ask about that as well.</Review>

No frills restaurant with incredible, affordable food.  Spicy but not too hot.  We particularly loved the curried mango, stewed lentils, sauteed lotus root, and sauteed beef.  Also their rice is more of a pilaf than regular rice and is phenomenal.</Review>

Their dining set up allows you to eat a few of their items for one meal.  I've liked and loved nearly all of them.  Their dishes are "exotic" and delicious. While the dining area is small and clean, it's a place you go to savor something different, not for a date, unless your date is a foodie, then go for it! A three-item meal is about $11.</Text>

The food here is amazing.  The service terrible.....drive 30 miles to get there and in order a large chicken curry dish and some Roti.
After 20 minutes the server comes with my Rotti and a small chicken curry and says your large order of curry is on its way.  I explain than why did you give me the small curry he says ok give me the small and I'll bring you a large curry.  I wait another 10 minutes and this time he comes out with the large curry but Frozen!   At this point I'm frustrated beyond belief.... Please have servers with some common sense.  I left without eating anything and asked the server to please charge me some the Roti piece I ate and all I want is to leave.  He rings me up and expects me to leave a tip on the pay pad.  Please get some girl servers that can speak well with customers and understand customer service especially in the restaurant industry.

When I explain my frustration.  The server says have you been here before like I'm new to ordering food.
Very bad service!<//text>

I first tried this place in Sept '17, have been coming here ever since. The subtle flavors and huge proportions of food surely account for a hearty lunch.<//Text>

Sri Lankan restaurants can be hard to find but Rice N' Spice satisfies your inner craving for the classic Kothu or Veggie rolls. The quality of the food is great for the price. The restaurant is a bit small (max: ~20 people) but you can always get take out and even eat outside. Their iced coffee is really good too, great on a hot summer day (and to nullify the spice). Very clean and awesome service!< /text>

Incredible Sri Lankan food.  The spices jump out.   The mutton is phenomenal.  The eggplant is to die for.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Never had Sri Lankan food. So delicious. Mutton is savory and perfect with saffron rice. Eggplant was tart, sweet and slightly caramelized. Owner saw me eyeing the crepes and brought me a "hopper" (coconut milk & rice flour crepes) with coconut sambal to try. Wow. So hospitable. Will definitely go back for the terrific exotic food and great service!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>NO STARS! I had a TERRIBLE experience post living there. They had a company hired to try to charge me 60,000 dollars saying we never officially ended our lease when I have paperwork showing otherwise. Don't stay here if you are worried about them calling you threatening your credit score. They call from different numbers across the country, very sketchy< /Text>< Pictures>

Stole my $100 deposit!
In short, I turned in my application and deposit before the property was sold to another another management company. Patrick, one of the rudest people I had ever had spoken to, told me that because the assistant manager was removed from her position under new management, I will NOT get my deposit. He said "go google the old management company and figure it out." He added that it's my problem to deal with because he doesn't have a computer. Just avoid this place!</Review>

Wanted to be a resident at Meridian for a really long time! Talked to Patrick for MONTHS AND MONTHS, he told me he’d call me back like 2 months ago... never heard anything back and never got my $100 back! Such a disappointment because the property is beautiful !<//Review>

“Community” events frequently feature music so loud that it gives me a headache in my own apartment, and they do not respond at all to requests to turn it down.

They claimed “we had posters up announcing the pool party, and live DJ from 12-4.”

I guess I missed the English class where we learned that “live DJ from 12-4” means “Leave your home from 12 to 4, or get tinnitus”.

Additionally, the halls constantly smell like pot.

They’ll take your security deposit no matter what you do.

Overall, very little respect for tenants, and they’ve done an excellent job of fostering an obnoxious community< /review>

The staff is very courteous  and attentive to the tenants needs from my own personal experience. The times I've requested maintenance or have maintenance related concerns, they were resolved in a quick timely fashion. Also the extra amenities offered here like the gym, pool, study rooms, etc...are well well worth it.  Like I've said, customer service is a priority here and the staff is awesome. A+++

Do yourself a favor and don't live here, I'm currently in the process of suing the apartment complex in small claims court for inhabitability because of loud noise caused by one of the hallway doors next to my apartment. After requesting  for this to be fixed over 10!!! Times over the past 6 months they told me to wear earplugs in my own apartment to ignore the noise when they should just fix the door. After the 10th time I told them they also told me that the door won't be replaced because it's to expensive so I'm currently suing them. Every night I can't sleep because the door slams to loudly every time someone walks in and it's going to take literally suing them in order to get them to fix the door, because that's where we're at now. Also their maintenance stuff is up bright and early at 9 am to scream at one another in front of my unit and wake me up after being unable to sleep in the unit due to their hallway door that slams. Also the units aren't sound proof at all and I can consistently hear what my neighbor is doing. Also when i first moved in my shower was producing brown water with sand in it  and it took them a nice two months to fix it :) also the AC breaker will just randomly shut off every 2 weeks and I have to call maintenance for them to fix it, move somewhere else if you have any questions on the quality of this place please feel free to send me a message! :)</Text>

My son and I had the pleasure of meeting Brian Cortez, the leasing manager when he graciously gave us a  tour of the apartment. Brian was very friendly and courteous. He patiently answered the many questions we had. I called Brian several times during the wait hold period and Brian always promptly replied with enthusiasm. Brian has been a pleasure to deal with and went above and beyond to help us.</text>

<text>The place is conveniently located nearby everything, the staff is great at helping you with accommodations as well as good at remembering who you are, and the place is entirely secured pretty well. They are currently renovating the building to improve it, but they are extremely respectful about the times they are renovating and give at least a 24 hour notice. Good place for college students who do not want to be too far from campus and events. Yet the building does host some pretty rad parties.< /text>< Rating>

The pool is also really cool and well-kept.

The only thing I really don't like is the use of pesticides to keep out bugs. (I'm more into compassionate/holistic living)< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29af86d08832f:0x6ab1f2bc0dad102e<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

I've been looking for housing options so I went by Meridian Pointe and it seems really nice. It's super close to CSUN's campus which is a must for me as a very busy, overly involved student. And they have everything you could ever need. Tons of really awesome amenities and gives off a really cozy, community feel.</review>

You gotta love this place given the location. I have lived here for 3 years and I must say I have never had a single complaint. The gym is convenient and the swimming pool is always clean for the summer time. Both the 405 and the 118 are somewhat close by also.  If you're looking for an apartment in the valley I highly recommend Meridian Pointe.<//review>

Meridian Pointe is a good, simple, and convenient apartment building to live in with many valuable ammenities. Tenants do not have water or electric bills, there is a pool, a hot tub, and an electronically gated parking lot. The building is also under three miles from the 405 and 118 freeways located in a neighborhood with many suburban luxurious such as a mall, movie theatre, and no shortage of city parks.

If you're looking for a quiet and well maintained building in the center of the San Fernando Valley this is an ideal property.<//review>

But that is where the perks end, having to deal with the staff here really sucks. They are not very helpful or nice which is a shame given the amenities. I would avoid if possible they have a captive customer bases with students so therefor their quality suffers. I'd also be wary of the 5 star reviews.< /Text>< Pictures>

Every time I go to Meridian Pointe it feels like home.  The staff are incredibly friendly, always available, and most importantly they care.  The pool area is so nice and that is my favorite part of the complex.  The rooms are pretty dope too!</text>

<Review>I need to update my review after living in five other complexes..

I lived here for a year and never had any problems with bugs, my appliances, or plumbing. There was a small issue with the grout in my shower but it was handled immediately by maintenance.

All of the staff, including maintenance, were very polite and friendly especially Regina!

We had plenty of parking with is a huge bonus in this area.
A nice apartment, NO BUGS, and FRIENDLY STAFF, PLENTY OF PARKING.

I left California with the impression that I could get all of that for $500 a month. Well for $500 outside of Chicago, I have an apartment and insect roommates. 🙂 I can't wait to move back to California this year ad re-apply.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

well, where should i begin...
1. First of all the looks of this place is terrible... the corridors look like you are inside a mental institute or some kind of asylum. the color and texture is just awful..
2. Now the management is also terrible, i have had people walk into my apartment at anytime of the day multiple times during my stay at Meridian without my approval.
*They perform so much alarm testing that if one day there is a real fire everyone would die because people would simply not give a damn.
3. Overpriced as f*ck just because it is next to csun.
4. You can hear your neighbors footsteps from up above very easily
5. In the beginning there was a lot of parties, but now the music noises are very uncommon.
6. You will wake up by either the immense sun light coming from the poorly curtained windows or some random dude using a leaf blower.

goodbye, and i would only recommend this place if you don't mind all the things i mentioned above.</Review>

Meridian Pointe is definitely a great establishment and place to stay for housing at CSUN. I feel safe with their security in the front lobby at all times and they surprise their tenets with free food pretty often! Closest to campus as well. Recommend to any student looking for housing.< /text>

Very good staff and convenient location. Good for more college students who are attending CSUN since it is literally across the street from the campus (no driving necessary). Staff is quite friendly as well. Since you do live across the street from CSUN be prepared to hear lots of sirens 24/7. Maintenance is fast and reliable!</Review>

<Review>This was the Worst place I have lived. I moved here because it is walking distance from CSUN. This is the only advantage that this place has.

Tags: Unsafe, Loud, Bad Neighbors, Lack of Parking, Consider Your Deposit Gone!

Now these are some of  things that happened to me in the past year:

1) I am married, and on the first three days there was two incidents that two group of tenants disturbed my wife while she was going to the laundry room, so I had to accompany her or she would do laundry in the times that I was home. I told about this to the management , but I am not sure what they did because I never hear back from them.

2) We had occasionally loud neighbors till our new neighbors moved cross the hall from us and the nightmare started. They were group of football players living in two adjacent apartments. They were extremely loud and for some reason they would bring their fights to the hall way. They would constantly cheat on their girlfriends and we had to tolerate their fights with their random girlfriends.
When they were playing computer games, they would make the strangest and loudest noises that a human vocal cords can produce!
I called the security after midnight many times during a week, and 6 out of 10 calls would be ignored by the security company although they would tell me they will send the security guard.

3)  I witnessed Pit bull fight in the barbecue area on a Sunday! I told the security guard. Again, I do not know what the outcome was.

4)  If you like pot, this place is your heaven. I do not smoke, so I was annoyed by the regular smell of pot in the hall ways.

5) Washing machines usually have human and pet hair in them from the previous person who used the machine.

6) Parking! It used to be good. But I do not know why we started to realized that after 12:00am you could not find any spots. And I saw many cars parking in the lot without permits. Once I saw the security in the parking lot and told him about those cars. He told me that they will tow them in the morning. Guess what! The owner would take the car out before the office was opened.

7) CONSTANT FIRE ALARM! The fire alarm is extremely extremely loud and it will go off in random times. This happens at least twice a week.

8) Forget your deposit! They devised and official way to keep your deposit!
We had no nails on the walls, no scratches. NOTHING. And I have a video of how I returned the apartment on my cellphone. However, they charged me for full painting of the apartment!

STAY WAY. 10 minutes driving distance, you can find better and cheaper places.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>2<//rating><text>This was legitimately one of the worst places I've lived in California. It is an apartment building that used to be the dorm rooms for CSUN in the 70's. It still looks and feels like a dorm room if you don't want to pay overprice for a remodeled unit. The walls are old and white brick that makes it feel like a jail cell. They DO have roaches and some mice depending on who you end up having to share with. You have to share the shower and toilet with another person and that person's friends which can sometimes suck as far as noise if you have incompatible schedules. They use their activity center and gym to sell you on the place. It will be the first thing they show you lol Worst 10 months of my life! The price is extremely ridiculous! You can find MUCH better elsewhere. I have a nice, cozy studio for $1100 with my own everything with full kitchen and ROOM TO WALK AROUND! They have updated it to look modern and some units are nicer than others, but it is still way overpriced. Paying over $1200 and not even getting a full-size fridge or stove is just dumb!</text>< username>

Such a lovely community and nice place. I have been staying at Meridian Point for almost two years, and I have never face anything that unsatisfactory..

All of the employees are happy to help the residents. Provide a great service and  a comfort stay in order to make the resident have a great time throughout she/he stay.. All respect and gratittde for the front desk team espacially to Regina who always I find her for any question, concern, or even inquire about anything for help, she is there for you.

I also would like to thank those people who are really working hard to keep everything clean and renovated maintenance workers..

Keep it up and all the best.
Thank you Meridian Point Staff.

Moving in here was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. They charged me $1150 for a jail apartment, the A/C always needed a filter change. Don't even get me started about the bugs and yours truly mr. cockroach that infests this apartment. The hallways smell like weed and they offer no help when people are begging to get out of their lease. The jail (studio) apartments should be less than 600.</Review>

So far everything has been pretty good few weeks of living here. I love how I'm directly across campus which is a huge plus.

Getting internet was frustrating but once it was set up it was cake. Nick and brian were pretty chill too. I love how they have study rooms that are ALWAYS quiet too and no one bothers you. One other thing I would complain about is that there is no where you can fill up water bottles. Even in the gym there are no water fountains. Besides that it's been pretty lit< /Text>

Luxurious living, can get it furnished or unfinished. Pool/spa, gym, study rooms w/with wifi, community center, bbq grills, and more! Right across CSUN so very convenient for students. Nick at the front desk is very helpful!</review>

<Review>I moved I in September last year. I got very discouraged after reading the reviews but not having any credit to go for a different option I decided to go for it and I'm really surprised! Im about to relocate and I don't have anything bad to say for what I chose!

I got one of the renovated one bedrooms apartments. They have been upgrading the building here and there making it better to live in (they changed all the toilets and all the windows since I moved in) and whenever I had a problem maintenance was ready to help !

It is pricy but so are most of the places around LA and considering they don't ask for an arm and a leg as deposit and that all utilities are included, the deal is not that bad. Of course.. Coming from a smaller city like I did the rent still feels overpriced, but so does every single one bedroom apartment in and around LA.

Management has been great. I also think it has a lot to do with the attitude you go about any issue. All the problems I had were handled promptly and with a smile (from missing mail, to "hey I left all my keys in Italy, can you let me in and help me until they get here?", to Moving crazy heavy furniture upstairs).

Overall I'm very happy and the only thing that wasn't perfect was not having the best view outside my window . But then again.. Who really does moving to a city?<//Review>< Pics>

Be extremely cautious if you are a college student or from out of state. Completely took advantage of myself and my sister. They claimed us to have unpaid rent the very last two months of our lease, despite all the proof of payments that we had. Backed us into a corner to where our only option was to double pay all of the rent or put ourselves in debt with court and travel fees to fight them on it. Management was useless, absolutely no help with the situation. They will take you to court and then not show up for it, yet tack on an extra THOUSAND dollars in "attorney fees". We faithfully paid rent for 8+ months with no problem and then all a sudden they "lose" our money in the final two months and then send us to collections to squeeze an extra $4,800  that was absolutely NOT OWED TO THEM.
Go ahead and move in if you enjoy being treated like garbage and robbed for everything you DON'T have.</Text>< pics>

They are such a rip off. Buyer beware. Be careful or you can kiss your security deposit good bye. At pre-move inspection they tried to charge me for an entire paint job for what they claimed were minor scuffs. They even admitted it was clean and there were no holes in the wall. The apartment is in beautiful condition, clean and free of any debris and they made it seem like it was a disgusting mess. I guarantee my son's unit is in excellent condition and very clean, they are just trying to rip me off with my security deposit. I would never recommend renting from these people. Buyer beware!!!!<//review>

There are roaches and various bugs that infest this place no matter how clean your keep your apartment they will stay (I take out my trash and wash my dishes daily, I still have them). My maintenance requests go unanswered. There's a crazy man that lives down the hall from me always slamming his door but they refuse to do anything about it (I and other neighbors have complained various times).

I read in a previous review response that these apartments are priced fairly and I can tell you NO, they are not. These studios are jail cells and the amenities and paid utilities still do not add up to what you pay per month. And I have no idea what "amenities" they're talking about because to use "The Zone" you pay extra. And everywhere else has a pool so that is nothing special.

If you like to live in a place where you feel safe I suggest you look else where. Don't let the "low" price fool you. I thought I'd give this place a chance despite the bad reviews but that was the worst mistake I've ever made. I will not be renewing my lease.

Oh! And the rent is going up! That's hilarious.< /review>< pics>

Dear prospective tenants,

Thanks to sharing a bathroom with another responsible tenant, my 3rd floor Drake unit at Le Meridian Pointe was decent. My unit was well-kept, therefore, no bug’s life for me at Le Meridian Pointe.

Target, restaurants and groceries are at a walking distance from Le Meridian Pointe. If I tired from walking, I utilized the transit system  effectively around Le Meridian Pointe.

Le Meridian Pointe is not Le Westin or Le Fairmont. Therefore, in the face of cultural diversity I give Le Meridian Pointe a solid 3 Stars in Northridge.

Kind regards to Le Meridian Pointe all the way from Canada!</text>

Not too bad. The Csun students are super loud every once in a while (screamijg every couple nights out of the week), but its fine. Im paying 1061(including furnature) for such a small 240 sqft drake studio where i have to share a bathroom. The girl is cool and sharing isnt as bad as i thought. If you have a 50k+ job, its manageable. Idk how these students are affording this. Im middle class and can im barely being able to live lol. Will be moving out to a place soon where ill be paying half with my own bathroom. No roaches and I believe ive been the nastiest in this entire building. Im on the 2nd floor so that mau be why. Anyway! God bless! Great security staff and day staff!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>All I have to say  STAY AWAY. I requested many times to do inspection before my move out date,  but they didn't do that, so they can take my security deposit. There was lady sitting upstairs in lobby ( called herself manager)  and  a guy name Brian, were extremely unprofessional and rude, they don't have ethics, how to talk to people or it could be their upbringing.  Once they get you in (signed lease), you are trapped with their written tricks. LA doesn't seem to be part of United States and City of LA is enjoying their pay checks not keeping eye on crooks business practices.<//Text>< pics>

My friend leased a dorm room there, a coupel weeks ago she had to tend to her ailing Grandmother who passed just recently. Upon returning to her home she was surprised to find herself locked out of her home on  2-4-16. The management there said they locked her out due to suspicious people in and around the home after speaking to Eva the property manager they went to her room and found these suspicious people residing in her home. The management let the same suspicious people stay in her room even after discovering a huge footprint on the door and damage to the door and doorlock. She still can not get a key and has to pay for a hotel room for the third night in a row. The property manager did inform her that one of the rooms was completely empty of her personal belongings. I smell a lawsuit and  some unemployed people< /Text>

<Review>My experience at meridian pointe has been absolutely memorable! As a second time resident at meridian pointe, I can say with great credibility that the leasing managers at this complex have worked extremely hard to maintain this college enviornment.
I have and continue to witness the great amount of dedication each employee at meridian pointe has made to satisfy the residents here.The leading agents, specifically Brian and Regina, deserve acknowledgment as they give 100% every single day. Without Brian's guidance, I wouldn't have been able to live here at meridian pointe. He puts the residents before anything, and that's one reason why I decided to stay here another year. Brian is a very ambitious/hardworking individual that deserves to be recognized. Both Regina and Brian work long hours and are still willing to help without an issue. I respect both of these leading agents without a doubt.
Overall, a huge Thanks to Brian and Regina, as without them I would not have had the same outlook on life.
I am a happy resident, with nothing to complain about. :) Thank you for making my experience here at csun the best one yet!<//Review><user_name>Victoria Hernandez<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

It's right across the street from CSUN and it's rates are reasonable. The staff and maintenence are very helpful. If anyone is thinking about moving there speak to Brian he has worked there for years and is very helpfull. If there is an issue he's is quick to help me fix it and is always there in the office. I have lived at Meridian pointe for 2years now and each year we've renewed our lease he has been the one to help us and always takes care of us. Everyone always has a smile on their face and I'm glad I chose Meridian pointe as my home.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c29af86d08832f:0x6ab1f2bc0dad102e< /Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1469121003432< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<review>This was the worst place that I have ever lived at in my entire life. I had janitors enter in and out of my room whenever they felt like it and even had ITEMS TAKEN out of my room and thrown in the trash and kept. This was the worse experience of my life.

Yeah this place sucks about a week ago our sink overflowed with what looked like sewage water we sent in a manteince request by the time they fixed it. It was hard to breath. After that we found a maggot accompanied by a few roaches even after they supposedly sprayed the place for bugs. The WiFi sucks they block every site I need in order to study YouTube facebook, and a bunch of others. They have a pool but it'seems so clorinated it turned my roommates pants from blue to purple. Did I mention we pay 1400 for one jail I mean dorm room</Text>

In your rental agreement they slip in a place for you to initial that you are aware that the security of thier buildings job does not entail inany way shape or form securing the building.
They allowed people to throw parties in the jacuzzi every night till 4am beer bottles clanking and drugs in plain view, oh and don't forget these drugged out party goers have to have thier music blarring.

After having a gun pointed at my apartment and having no one take anything seriously I left the building in fear for my life. One day at about 5m a man was so drunk and drugged out he fell through the glass window by the jacuzzi, proceeded to tkae his pants off and run around the pool then put his pants on and humped a chair until the police came to arrest him. Then he saw the videos i was taking of him and threatened to come back and kill me. SECURITY DID NOTHING.

I witnessed nonstop antagonizing of the person living in the building who I was helping because she slid down a pair of waxed ungripped stairs several feet away from the apartment.
Maintenence even had the balls to disagree. I have evidence.

SAVE YOURSELF AND MOVE SOMEWHERE WHERE THE STAFF IS COMPETENT ENOUGH TO DO THEIR SIMPLE JOB AND THIS PLACE IS A DUMP. LIKE MAJOR DUMP FOR THE PRICE THEY WANT.<//Review>

Some of the best customer service and the attention to detail was fabulous.  If I crash my car again I can tell you where it'll end up. Right here at H&R Body Shop getting it done right and getting it done right the first time.  On top of that they had checked in with me several times by phone letting me know the status and progress of my vehicle! 👌💯👌</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I was in an auto accident and initially the insurance company wanted it totaled without looking at it. I worked in the insurance business for years and was always told that H & R did the best and reliable repairs so I insisted they do an inspection on my car(which by the way was my baby). The whole staff were compassionate and understood my frustrations with the insurance company. In the end my vehicle was totaled but I felt better about it knowing that professionals had looked at it. If anything ever happens to another one of my cars... fingers crossed it won't...I will not hesitate to take it to them.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Had a Black 2015 Sonata Limited that got rear ended at 50 mph while the car itself was STOPPED on the freeway due to traffic jam ..... Thought it was totaled , took it to these guys , got it back , could not EVEN tell it was in a accident !!! Paint matched up perfectly , all new parts , finish was immaculate ! My Son got rear ended in his brand new raspberry 2019 Mustang in 2019 . Took it there for repair and paint , and then had them paint double black lines on hood , roof and trunk . Again , could not tell the car had been in an accident and the racing lines were put on perfectly . Jeff was the rep who I dealt with , good guy , easy to talk to , said it would be done at a certain time and both cars were . Been 2 years since I last used them but for the work they did for me back then , definitely 5 stars across the board !</review><date>1614977516408<//date><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Looking to get any body work or paint done on your car? This is the place to go to In Turlock. From the office to technician staff, you couldn’t ask for better customer service. Luis was very pleasant to talk to and was able to explain everything that had to be done to my Lexus thoroughly. The turn around time to complete was fast, and the job came out great. The team was very attentive to details. Thanks again, and will be referring to family and friends.<//Review><Date>1594394435683</Date>< gmapID>

< review>
Just three days after purchasing my Hellcat, on my early commute to work, a pice of tire hit my hood. The impact left 3 scratches and a small dent. I called around to some shops and was told I would most likely have to paint the hood. I spoke to Luis on the phone to bring the car in and he seemed really happy to help me. He assured me he would take care of it. I was extremely happy once I received my Hellcat. The job was done extremely well, it's like the accident never happen.< /review>

<Review>The ladies in the office are very kind, professional, and knowledgeable about what needs to happen to help you get things done. The appraiser was very efficient, knowledgeable, and I felt, answered all my questions honestly. Once I got my car in for repairs the work was completed in a timely manner. If ever in need of repairs again, this will be the place I take my vehicle to.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><username>Anne Anderson<//username>< Date>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Top notch auto body shop.  Our insurance company offered several different approved body shops.  Two of them had brand name recognition but after comparing reviews, my wife and I went with H & R.  So glad we did.  Her car looked brand new (2010 model), at least the part that was damaged.  They paid attention to items that didn't look damaged, like alignment and tire balancing. They also competed the car on time.  My wife said they were very nice, and made her feel like her satisfaction was  very important.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x809107adabd81a33:0xeffe848521bf3cad</Gmap_id><user_id>117270504328913710603<//user_id><Time>1556648458452< /Time>< Resp>

Great taco place. Great prices too.  I got a red sauce and some limes. The chicken and carnitas was very good. The El pastor was ok.  I will definitely come back to try a burrito.< /text>

When ever I got to this location on van Buren in riverside I would get the 2 chimichangas plate and its usually on point and very good with juicy flavorful shredded beef and I would finish the whole plate .But this time the meat had way too much fat and i didnt like biting into a mouthful of slimy chunks of fat ,couldn't even finish half of one....so normally would rate it 5 stars but was disappointed this time .....<//Review>

<Text>Great Mexican food that is reasonably priced.  This shop makes all of the salsas, meat marinades,  fresh beans in house and you can taste the love that they put into it.  This is one of  the best places to eat in Woodcrest.< /Text>< Pics>

Most horrible Taco Tuesday I've ever had I will never go back the only thing that was good here was the 1 Corona beer that I had. Found a big long black hair in my food had it half swallowed down my throat when I pulled it out of my mouth just about threw up all over the table.....< /Text>

<date>1609738556700<//date><Rate>3</Rate><Review>I ordered the "MS Nachos" and it was $10 plus tax and I was a bit disappointed on the amount they give you. From previous visits at another location the portion was so large, and at that time it was just a regular order of Nachos not "MS or MR Nachos". The MS Nachos looked like a kids size nachos in a small round foil tin with a clear plastic lid. Once you got through the top it was all chips and not much of Nachos that I'm used to.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>There carne asada tacos were good. But I ordered 3 mr.taco carne asada nachos. Extremely salty along with the cheese and chips were dried and burnt. The nachos used to be amazing not sure if they switch owners or not. Unfortunately extremely disappointed and a waste of 50 bucks.< /Text>< Pics>

Food isn't well prepared. Michelada Mix always tastes like old lime juice and is never fresh anymore. Cook gets to chose what he wants to make and what I order is never available but always on the menu.< /Text>

This place is reasonably price for what they serve. The food is very fresh and has a drive-through which I don’t know how they make food that quickly. Inside you can enjoy a complementary chips and salsa which you don’t see much anymore. The staff is friendly and happy to help you get what you want. I highly recommend the shrimp tacos they are worth the price!￼< /text>

It is cool and the dishes seem good but some of the meats has a lot of "cuero" in it... Eww i want to eat meat not something chewy... I would only get the options with shrimp... The birria was too salty too... My friend like it but it has convinced me.<//Review>

The staff are very nice, but the Chef is awesome. He not only cooks but interacts with the clientele. The establishment is clean they have a great salsa bar with chips (loooooooove the really hot ones) Yes they do sell alcoholic beverages. Sometimes at lunch they are so busy that the service takes WAY TOO LONG to get your food and get back to work, but that's because the food is REALLY GOOD. The Carnitas Street tacos are my favorite but everything is good. Keep it up you guys I will always come to you and send others your way!!</Text><user>100620244944254224011<//user><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

<Text>From what I know, the one I go to is one in a chain.  I've never been to any of the others.  The people here are friendly & the food is fantastic!  Most of the time I have the lengua tacos or the campechana.  The lengua is really tender & practically melts in your mouth & the campechana is crammed full of shrimp, octopus, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, pico de gallo, etc.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
I was disappointed the burrito I ordered a carne Asada burrito the meat had too much oil in it I could feel the oil across my mouth it was terrible, and way too salty. I asked for beans and rice got nothing added to the burrito.
I also ordered some asada  fries and it had no beans and extremely  oily with cheese smothered on top. I went through drive thru and was late for an appointment otherwise I would have drove back and got a refund.  You say you pride yourselves  on the pan and not the can.  Perhaps you all need to reevaluate your approaches on the quality of the food.  Oil and salt doesn't necessarily make food better.  If someone doesn't get an order correct that's understandable.  I don't like leaving bad reviews but hopefully you guys tidy up the Mr.  taco vision or check on the people and their customer service ability.  Remember impeccable not unacceptable when it comes to comida  Mexicana .< /Review>

they claim that their dining table area is only open till 9:30 yet we were there at 9 p.m. not a place to go to get customer service.

<text>I am soooo disappointed!! I eat here all the time. I have used them for large parties several times! We live super close and I really do love there food. Sadly, last night I placed a huge order, over $200, for a Christmas party. There were about 30 people there. Over half of the people have become really ill today. Bad stomach issues. Even one of the ladies husbands ate the leftovers and is now sick. Something was definitely wrong with the food.
I called and they didn’t seem to care, nor did they seem to want to make it right. Just a I’m sorry and wanted to get me off of the phone. I’m floored. Didn’t ask when I placed my order or anything to investigate what could have happened. So so sad. They have lost my business for sure! What a shame to run a company with terrible customer service- at that point it doesn’t matter how good the food is!</text>< Rating>

<text>Took forever for them to make our food in the drive thru. Ordered pepsi then was told Pepsi ran out. They gave us our drinks but waited till the food was done to give us our straws on the hottest day of the year. When we got the food the lettuce on my torta was soggy. The food was bland and super greasy. Fries were undercooked. I wont be coming back.< /text>< pics>

Not even close in quality to the Redlands location. Carne asada is just unseasoned ground beef. More like a fast food place that has nothing similar to the Redlands location. It was busy, so looks like many people like it.<//Text>

This place is amazing, it can get pricey but only because they have so many good things to eat. You get a lot of food for the price you pay. The staff is great and the place is clean, number 1 Mexican food spot around</review>

<time>1567262298916</time><review>This place is great. I have lived here in riverside for 40 years. The place to go was Papis. I would say that Mr. Taco is the new papis of riverside.. It is a must visit. Their Mr. Burrito with carnitas is amazing. The carnitas are cooked to perfection a little crispy yet tender underneath. So good. Definately worth a try. Only certain ones serve beer though. Sp if your looking for great mexican food with a cold beer after a long work day head to the one on van buren blvd closest to arlington. Clean, friendly and soooooo good!</review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<Text>My family and I love coming here on Sundays! The food is yummy and the staff is kind. The main owner/chef recognizes me and my order as soon as I walk in. They serve great and fresh Mexican food, if you want authentic and tasty food, come here! [edit: 4/8/18] I came in today for an order of yummy Mr Fries! My orders were all yummy and the service was good. My only complaint was that as we weee enjoying our meal, an employee went around sweeping; this caused many dust particles to fly toward our meals and we probably ate dust. Our suggestion is to sweep after when all costumers are gone!</Text>< Pictures>

There are many delicious options for your plate.  All the ingredients are right there behind the glass and you you can tell the person making your food exactly how you want it.  There are a lot of good sauces and salsas to spice up your food.<//text>

Horrible service. We sat around waiting while everyone who came in after us was being served. So we paid for our drinks and got the rest of our money back. I was so unbelievably hungry too. Bad service can make you lose an appetite real quick.< /text>

Even though i had been standing there for about a minute.... The cook, the cashier.... Neither one of them said hello or good morning well be right with you. No eye contact. The food though I'm pleased. Potatoes instead of rice that a good switch up. If their customer service was as good as my green chilaquiles i would've given a 5 star.< /Review>< Date>

Good place to stop for a quick lunch and have smaller tacos, this place isn't the best choice for the cost saving person but the food is great and I highly recommend using the limes for extra flavor, you can get a variety of types of tacos so overall it was a good experience.<//Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Okay service, okay food. But I payed $8.00 for tacos and I was not full after I finished. I would probably eat here again if someone else wanted to go, but I wouldn't go by myself again, just because it wasn't that great. Plus the floor was pretty dirty, felt like it hadn't been swept or mopped in weeks. My feet felt like they were grinding dirt into the tile floor while I was sitting down eating lunch. The bathroom was also a mess, there was no soap and there was a toilet scrubber on the floor for some reason.<//Text>< Resp>

There meat taste like dog food! If you want better food try the mr:taco on Main Street way better cooks and they don't over cook their meat and dry it out  like these people. Waste of money and time !!!!

Also the customer service is horrible and they Are so dirty from the tables we're customers eat and we're they prepare food at.

Someone needs to report how nasty these people are.< /review>

Wasnt the best. Compared to other mr taco's the portions were pretty small. They also charge for refills of any of the fruit drinks. Taste wise they dont deviate from the company menu.</review></record></dataset><record>

I'm gonna be honest, I go here solely for the menudo and beer!  The service is ok and price is right but...5he menudo is a very generous portion..lots and lots of meat and it's right on the money!!!  If you are in the orangecrest/riverside area on a weekend or after a major hang over, you know this is your cure!  I recommend.< /Text>

The service is thee best. It's always wonderful when you truly feel like you can have it Your way. Also the greeting and the order placing are set up perfect. Who doesn't want to see thier food being made? Armondo is the best cook!!  Making my gordita not only taste delicious but look like true mexician cuisine. Chrisrina was so sweet and answered all of questions with honesty.
Prices are right! Atmosphere is awesome!<//Text>

<text>The food taste GREAT! But the service is soooooo slow! The drive thru took 20 minutes of my lunch break. I only get a lunch break from 2:00p-2:30p and I barely have enough time to eat after I come here. Plus my drive back to work.  The lady on the order com says: "Hello, one moment please" . Then she comes back 10 minutes later! :( very sad 2 stars. But the food taste great.</text>< Pictures>

<text>If you know what good Mexican food is, and I mean legitimate Mexican food, you're gonna hate this place, if you only like tacos made with Lawry's seasoning packets from aisle 5 and preshredded cheese, you might like it, but they can't even make a cheese quesadilla correctly.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Note to self! Don't go at the end of their day, you'll regret it. My wife and I just went and got a late dinner to go. Taco salads, both Caritas, but hers was without rice, beans or pico. Mine, it was fully loaded and was SUPPOSED to have their habanero orange hot sauce. It didn't! Not only did it not have what it was supposed to, the meat was extremely oily and taste of dirty cooking oil (the kind that was needing to be swapped for fresh oil), as was the shell which was overcooked as it was. The portion size was definitely on point as it was large, but the taste was just not there. The aftertaste is even worse! They've been really good in the past, but the last several visits have had poor or sloppy service and now the food reflects the overall subpar staff.  I'll stick with a different local place from now on.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The food is great, but the lobby was so dirty I only found one clean table. There was food on the tables and floor. I will sure think about it twice before going there again.</Text>
