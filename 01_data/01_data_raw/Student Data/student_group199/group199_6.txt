After driving from San Diego up to Paso Robles we pulled off the road and discovered this lovely little town of Arroyo Grande. Hungry and ready for a glass of wine, we stumbled upon the Rooster Creek Tavern. The outdoor seating was socially distanced and clean and we settled in. We got the margarhita pizza and a local glass of wine. The service was impeccable, the pizza was delicious with those perfectly sweet Italian tomatoes and fresh basil on top of a delicious crust. A very pleasant surprise and great dinner break after driving all day!<//review>

Very knowledgeable staff. I do not currently own a gun and have been looking to get one. They answered all my questions showed me some cool product and carry lots of ammo. They really help me with the decision on the purchase. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<review>I've bought a few guns from here and had great customer service. If I could I would give them 6 stars. Always friendly. Very knowledgeable.
Now the best part. They were able to find a rifle that other shops couldn't.
Thanks Jim!  Customer for life.</review>< pictures>

<text>Just purchased my first firearm. I wanted to shop a small local business as opposed to one of the large sporting good stores, and I'm glad I did. This place is top notch. They have a great selection and the staff was phenomenal. Mike was fantastic in helping me pick the perfect gun for my needs. He showed me several rifles, showed me how they all worked, and was able to answer every question. Every single person working there from the staff to the owners are wonderful. Even the regular customers were very welcoming and friendly. It's a family run shop and they treat you like family. I will definitely be going back to Roosters for my next gun.< /text><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x80ecc357c9015b1f:0x16b32ff9c0580164</gmap_id><time>1528864491878</time><userid>114948922286169665394< /userid><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Best firearm prices on the central coast (I paid  $20 under MSRP which on the central coast is unfortunately unheard of, usually its $100 over MSRP!!). Really friendly staff who obviously love what they do. Really professional operation, makes buying a gun feel like buying a car (in a good way). They do all the paperwork in a nice office in the back. Really large selection of firearms as well. Some interesting guns to choose from, not just your run of the mill Remingtons and Glocks.</review>< Pictures>

Best place to come get frozen yogurt. I come here multiple times a week. The store owner is very nice and friendly. There are really good flavors and many toppings to choose from. My favorite is vanilla with real chocolate sprinkles. You can also get milkshakes here. I recommend this place if you want frozen yogurt.<//text>

<Text>Great variety of frozen yogurt at Tutti Frutti Stockdale. First rate service with a smile. Very Covid-19 safe gives all patrons hand sanitizer. Keeps all topping closed until you ask for a topping. Everyone in the family had an amazing frozen yogurt.< /Text>< rate>

The owner was very attentive. Its been a while that I've seen an owner interact or be so involved in his work. He definitely made us feel welcomed. The yogurts are delicious and all the fruit is fresh!<//review>

The gentleman that was working here was very friendly and upbeat. I appreciated that. It was a little busy and my son asked if they had milk tea and he responded by asking him what cup size he wanted for his yogurt. I had my son grab a cup and decided to get the yogurt. But, half the stalls that dispense yogurt, had nothing. This limited us down to just a handful of flavors. At this point, we just got a small bowl and left. I felt bad because the gentleman was really nice. But, I dont think I will return.<//text>

I don't know about the other locations, but the one at Stockdale and coffee, under it's current ownership, puts special effort into purchasing quality frozen yogurt and ingredients to mix some of its own flavors. It is definitely a worthwhile stop. The service is good, the shop is clean, and it's open pretty late. On top of all that, there's almost always a discount to be had from coupons on the back of the receipts from the neighboring Albertson's. Kinda hard to beat.<//text>

One of our two favorite frozen yogurt places. We drive across town to come here. Shop is clean, workers are friendly and the frozen yogurt is creamy and tasty.
My favorite flavor is the Taro! Who would have thought that would be a GREAT frozen yogurt flavour? But it is! It's a wonderful base for a variety of toppings too. Try it! 👍< /Text>

I would have given 5 stars because I usually love most of the flavors and my cup overfloweth, but..this day the owner/manager was giving 2 sugar wafers "free" in each cup sold...before he weighed them! Some may say it could only be pennies but to some those pennies mean a lot.< /Text>

Went here to kill some time before a hockey game tonight. Great variety of flavors and toppings. Spoke with the owner for about 10 minutes. Super nice guy, very down to earth and he's got great prices. Absolutely would recommend this place to anyone in need of froyo!< /review>

<Text>Extremely limited variety. Would probably go there only if everything is shut down. The fruit I got there was old af and like soggy, the pineapple sorbet was blah and didn't feel I got a good price for product ratio. Kind of left feeling cheated. Don't recommend, try the place Yogurt Zone around 4pm is the best time. This place kinda sucks< /Text>< user>

They have all the good frozen yogurt flavors you can think of, and most are pretty good. Prices are very good. The only downside is that it's such a small place that in the summer time you'll have to sit outside where is super hot or go to your car and eat it there.</Review>

Just like every frozen yogurt shop, a little run down, but gets you what you want. Nothing too bad but nothing too good either. Would always recommend the pistachio flavor< /Text>

No water accessible for customers to drink.  Asked owner about it and he said he could get us some and then never did.  My daughter and I were thirsty from start to finish.  Yogurt was great though.<//review>

Great flavors and nice staff. Second only to Yogurtland. I like Death by chocolate and the cappuccino flavors the best. The pomagranite sorbet is amazing. Another incorrect and idiotic store layout. Not enough space when busy. Bunch up by the restrooms and then cut in front of people to get what you want. Ridiculous. The yogurt is great though.</text>

I'll hand it to PB though, they have the BEST quality. Anyway not only do they have a vast selection of flavors but they have nearly all the fixes you would want.

TF has great flavors and the price fits my wallet.  The one thing that keeps me coming back because TF isn't the closet yogurt shop to me is that they have 4 different sizes of cups and not just 2 like all of the other ones.  Most places have big and giant cups and I always feel like I need to fill it up only to find I can't eat it all and have to throw it away as I don't have any where to freeze it.  At TF they have small, medium, large but they also have a kids size.  I like to go after work at least 3 times a week and get a kids size and eat it on my way home.  It cools me off after a hard day.  Thanks TF for thinking of everyone.< /text>

If I were only reviewing their equipment quality and ease of use, I would give them five stars.  However, their customer service is another matter.  If the IRS and the DMV got together and had a child and it grew up to provide customer service, that would be Samsara's customer service model.  I've had so many different reps in the few years I've been with them it's laughable, apparently the reason is they're promoting people upward, but it might be in their best interest to not consider their customer rep jobs the lowest ones on the totem pole and try leaving some good ones there.  Furthermore, they nearly refuse to speak with you on the phone.  They prefer everything be done via email, so what used to be done in one phone call now takes a veritable snowstorm of emails.  Finally, if you need to order more equipment, your customer rep no longer handles that for you--which does leave one to wonder what the customer reps are actually there for.  No, it's totally self-service, and you have to find the link within the software to access their store, and then it's a complicated series of clicks to end up with 1)the wrong equipment, or 2)not enough equipment.  Which, of course, leads to another extremely irritating interaction via email with whoever your rep of the day is.  I'm staying with them 100% because the reporting and analytics are top-notch.  I dread any time I find myself having to interact with them.< /Text>

SCAM!!!

I have contract that I signed for 3 years in 2017. We are canceling it and this company is trying to tell us they renew it automatically for another year. When the confirmation I signed for clearly states ,"The Service renews automatically for successive periods equal to your
payment term" Which in our case was MONTHLY. They bring up a express order term that was updated on Feb 3031 and try to contest it. We aren't even express order!

DO NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM

UPDATE
Quick to respond to google review. I email and call for cancellation and to resolve this issue. 6 days goes by. No response to email and when you call. All they would say is we don't handle it and to email.

Called me today at 4:42 pm. Left voicemail. Call him back at 4:43 pm. No answer and no call back. Still no email.

UPDATE 4/2
Charged me monthly on 3/25. Told them to stop charging us and get us canceled. 1 week later today. They charge us again. DO NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM

Update 4/14
Got the cancelation and refund< /Text>

This company is the worst customer service in there accounting department They do not allow you to pay online or over the phone.

It takes days or I should say months to figure out what is wrong when you should be able to make a payment on the spots. You should be able to pay on there website once you up date your credit card info. This company is a joke!

!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</text>

Usually I don't write any reviews but these Guys a special!
So there are a lot of thing to tell you about this Company but I probably have to write a book. Poor Customer service It is impossible to reach your account manage over the email, over the phone you got no chances plus they don't know anything about this company at all. then all the agreements comes per device. Financing and Accounting Department Replay you only 24 hours after you email them and NO NO NO!! There is no why to get them over the phone, so I was solving an issue emailing Back-and-Forth over a month dealing with rude and incompetent  people.
The way they act it seems to be a criminal organization.
Before you decide to go with them think about it!
GOOD LUCK!< /Text>

Very dissatisfied with their products, we had an accident and went take a look at the video, the quality is very bad, I wasn't able see anything on the truck driving on by, when I emailed them they said there's nothing they can do about. I've paid them over 3y for a piece of plastic that is useless, hopefully you think twice before ordering them.

While I have not had the pleasure of tasting the poke bowls, I not so reluctantly admit, I was drawn to the logo of the wise owl which I can only aspire to be. Also; the blue background is a very good choice, especially in its two varying color shades for they remind me of Kṛṣṇa in its current depicted state (this although Kṛṣṇa is colorless bringing forth all colors). My closing remark. Keep on dancing and Love everyone for there where otherness is perceived is Self desiring togetherness. Namaste. One Love.< /Review>

I wish I would’ve read these reviews before I signed up with Samsara. I’m trying to cancel their Service. Customer Support is nonresponsive. I can’t wait to be done with this company. Highly recommend using somebody else. They claim to be the fastest growing fleet management company but I don’t believe it.</Review>

I have to say this company had unbelievably great customer service.  I would highly recommend that you give them a call.  Ryan was great!
The product itself worked well.  Unfortunately, I no longer use them since I closed down my business.  I did end up over paying a bit since I paid for a year long subscription upfront but I have No complaints.  Great company, Great people.  I highly recommend them!!!<//text>

<Review>Ordered 4 cameras to start for our fleet. From the get go I wasn’t a fan. Downloading videos takes forever, if it even works properly. There leads to the other problem....if it works properly, the cameras on 3 of the 4 trucks all failed within a few months. When we had an actual issue occur we couldn’t access any feed. We never got an alert the cameras weren’t functioning, and haven’t been for months. So we were screwed. I then tried to work a resolution with samsara asking for a few months given back and new cameras. They refused to take anything off, and said I need to send in the current cameras to be “repaired” before sending new units. We operate impounding and repossessions. We absolutely need cameras and need them reliable, hence why we paid a PREMIUM for this service being chalked up as the best. You’re better with a $40 dash cam from Walmart and a 512gb SD card, sad but true. I refused to bug out our existing contract to condone this behavior and let it roll to collections. Equipment sucks, service sucks, ease of use sucks. I would highly recommend any system BUT this. I hope Samsara fails very soon.</Review>< time>

I waited 2 days for support... You need to send an email and wait for them until they decide to take your case. They tie you up with a contract, and provide the worst possible customer service a company can offer.

There are plenty of other ELD providers, not only better in quality, also in customer service... GPSTAB, and Keeptrucking are a way better option then SAMSARA I promise you that.

Thank god I was just doing a trial... Can't imagine signing a 3 year contract with your company.<//review>

<text>I was excited to move to Samsara from my current provider due to all the technology and variety of solutions offered.  Once I installed the hardware, only 1 gateway on my 14 trucks was performing as promised.  After new harness, adapters and 3 months of working with their engineering team, there has been no progress on my other 13 trucks.  There has also been empty promises from their sales team for transport refrigeration tracking/monitoring, that I have been given excuse after excuse as to why they still do not have it.

I am extremely disappointed highly encourage you to look elsewhere for mobile communication solutions.</text>< Rating>

<Review>Apparently Samsara will not even allow me to purchase their products/services for my fleet. I've inquired numerous times and they just don't respond. After reading the reviews, I don't think I'll be pursuing this any further. I'd say that we'll likely not see this company still in business further down the line.

Excellent concept yet to be nailed.

Very pushy sales reps similar to godaddy.
You have to request footage from cloud and it only comes out in little short clips you cannot watch a whole route or a little longer than a min or so. No actual live view / it doesn’t work just snaps of pictures.

3 year contract and price makes it a no as far as decision making with better onboard dvr devices that have LTE or WiFi transmission with more cameras (outdoor waterproof cameras) and more makes it easy to steer clear of samsara.

They try to sell you on value but can’t stand behind selling a good product by locking you into a 3 year contract instead of allowing you to use a “amazing” product and staying with them because it works....< /Text>

Do not use the "Check Price" feature on the website, it only led to daily calls from sales reps. After I requested they contact me via email (all I wanted were some quotes, not to be aggressively surveyed), they keep calling.

More importantly, as soon as I provided Samsara my phone number, I immediately began receiving spam and fraudulent calls. I suspect that Samsara shares information with (less than respectable) third parties or their website is insecure. Point is, my information got into unintended hands and now that spam calls don't stop. Just a reminder, to never give your phone number online, and to use throwaway emails where possible.

I've requested that my information be removed from all lists and databases, including any third party lists. Let's hope Samsara is respectful enough to, at least, do this right.</review>< Name>

<review>This review is for Samsara's Covid-19 response.  Our company ordered additional gateways/cameras in January of 2020 that were awaiting their new vehicles.  We had to follow up with samsara as the units never came in.  Come to find that they sent the packages with addressing them to anyone and the parcel did not say Samsara on it anywhere, so obviously our company's receiving dept had no idea who or what this parcel was.  I was able to sort it out until we reached out to our sales rep (Steve Arola), who provided the tracking details. Once we tracked down the units a few weeks after they were sent, we already started feeling the immediate effects of Covid-19 as much of our business originates in China.  As shelter-in-place was taking place in our region, we were forced to cancel all new vehicle additions to our fleet along with many other decisions.
When contacting Samsara to see if we would be able to return the brand new devices that had never been taken out of the box or installed, we were instead presented with a copy of our contract we had signed in January for the new units and a refusal to accept a return. The units are in their sealed boxes and have NEVER been opened or installed, yet samsara refused to accept a cancellation despite them not even being able to correctly address the units offer zero flexibility given current events.

Additionally, we inquired with Samsara if they had a planned response to Covid-19 since many of our vehicles would be taken out of service for a few months.  After a couple of weeks, we finally heard back from them and they offered to deactivate the units that were out of service and suspend payment on those units, BUT during that time, the contract end dates would be extended and we would still be required to continue paying for the remaining units still in service. This "offer" however essentially puts more money into Samsara's pockets with extended contracts as they attempt to take advantage of a worldwide pandemic to squeeze money from a suffering business. I have no qualms paying for services used, but their attempts to phrase this as some sort of generosity is a sick joke.< /review><Name>Lance Jensen< /Name>< Resp>

Was looking for a new ELD provider. Signed up with samsara. They don't mention anything about a 3 year contract with most of their services. Cancellation fees are crazy high so be careful. Once sales are made good luck reaching out to anyone in customer support. I can never get thru to them when I call. I leave multiple voicemails that don't get returned. Really bad customer services if you ask me. Do not recommend.<//review>

I was a customer of Samsara for over 2 years. After believing Samsara was a good company I referred other companies, also due to the referral incentives pushed by their sales associates. I referred a fleet over to Samsara after some time Samsara stop receiving payment from the referred company they decided to take money from my card on file monthly for that referred companies bill. I was unaware when it started thinking it was my monthly payment for my fleet of truck until one day I was looking through bank statements and noticed multiple payments being pulled monthly from Samsara. I immediately contacted their accounting department and was given the run around for nearly two months. After sometime a rep called me and basically said it was a mistake that must of been my fault and they will not be refunding over 3,000.00 that was deducted throughout nearly a year.  I tried to reason with them as being a long time customer that they can pay me back slowly or work out some type of repayment and I was basically told they will not reimburse any of my money taken.  I am taken the proper steps now to ensure I am reimbursed by Samsara since they were illegally pulling payments from my account for another trucking company's bill.  I am also leaving this comment to make other customers aware of the shady business being performed behind closed doors.<//text>

I signed up for the service and received the equipment with a 30 day guarantee. I still have their equipment sitting in a box in my office waiting to send it back. No one is returning my calls. I will never recommend this company to anyone, which is to bad as their software and hardware are great but customer service makes or breaks a business and this company has none.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>First off, I am usually not the kind to go online and write bad reviews, but this is a must. We were very excited about the Samsara product.  We pushed our salesman to give us a 60 day trial which we are very thankful for.  The second week we started having problems with cameras not working.  I called every few days about multiple cameras not recording.  Since we were new to the system, I had a open mind and thought maybe we were doing something wrong on our end.  Maybe I was too nice and passive about having these problems and they thought it was ok to brush me off.  They usually got back to me within the day, but by the time they did get back to me the cameras would be working again and they told me they would look into it.  They told me many times they did software updates and refreshed the system and it should fix it.  One of my vehicles was involved in an accident this week, we were excited that samsara said they got all the problems squared away and we would be able to review the footage from the incident.  WRONG!  No footage!  They said for some reason it wasn't connected to their network at that moment.  I advised them that I needed to know the steps on how to return the system that consistently failed me.  I was not going to pay a premium for a product that was not producing the way they promised it would.  Since that request, I have received numerous phone calls about them fixing the issue and their representatives trying to go into detail about the failure and what they have done.  Too bad they didn't give my system this kind of attention before this incident.  Only now that I do not want their product they are trying harder< /Review>< Pictures>

It was now a hundred times reported that we are getting bad inspection reports,warnings and tickets due to some flaws uncovered in Samsara driver's app.
Firstly DVIR report is not eqquiped with important information like truck plate no.,odometer reading and location.Not only this Inspector wants it to be shown that DVIR is in accordance with
Schedule 1.
Secondly Samsara driver app has no option to transfer 14 days logs to Canadian MTO.

For both the above stated flaws we wanted an urgent solution.Forget about any solution, these issues were never taken up by you guys and you people continued making false claims and promises.

These days market run on customer feedback and reviews and I am sure you have no expectations from at least Canadian Market.<//text>< user>

From other reviews its no wonder why they have zero customer service they are too busy wasting my time calling me after numerous requests to take us off their "Call List" The excuse I get each time is "I am new" yet I have been hearing from Chris for over 6 months continually.< /text>< Pictures>

After reviewing several ELDs, we decided to sign with Samsara. The support and sales are very helpful. They addressed every problem in a timely manner during our trial. The hardware is well built and designed with pride. Our drivers reported ease of use. One driver recieved his very first smartphone 6 months prior. One driver came from larger fleets with Omnitracs, Peoplenet, and other well established ELD providers. He said it was easy to use and caught on in 30 seconds. He said essentially they all appear the same to him. The administration side is nice on the eyes. The layout works very well. The temp sensors are a very nice feature. We have some older reefers that needed a temp data record. We are an OTR (over the road) trucking company with mostly reefer and livestock trailers. Samsara seems to be an honest well organized company with focus on customer support and an awesome product line.<//Text>

They sent us wrong items, never provide any service. The sales sent us an email said account is cancelled,  but still keeping charging us more than $300/month! I will sue them.
Don't choose Samsara!<//review>

I absolutely love this store, the environment and the employees. They are in a town that reminds me of home and I enjoy the peace and quiet along with the frog Hall of Fame along the streets. I would also recommend  Moaning Caverns, the repelling and cave tour are awesome.</Review>

<user_name>Kimmi Tyler</user_name><Text>This stone and fossil shop is amazing! My family has been coming here for 25 years and it's still fun to come buy something new every time we are in the area. Their prices are extremely fair and they even have a wholesale room in the back. There's something for everyone, from $0.25 small quartz stones to a cave bear skull for $900. We spend so much time looking every time, even if we intend to make a quick trip. Well worth the stop!</Text>< UserId.>

<review>This place has an absolutely fantastic. They had an unbelievable assortment of gemstones, fossils, mounted butterflies, beetles and bats, too!! The assortment of gemstones was massive...the storefront opened up into a large warehouse and that was when I realized that this place had the biggest assortment of rough and tumble stones under one roof that I had ever enjoyed.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH1o7P8mDhnyVOq4zHWrPLIbCEndDUDBH6AA0i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-WfSkIcLQ0gmhi66klmZOCWBrsd1cuiaeOVMg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8090959ad635dbbf:0xd1fd41bcafd4e9d7</Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>No COVID precautions were followed. I was laughed at by the owner when mentioning the mandates. Three elderly people (owners & owners sister/I overheard) Ignorant, inconsiderate and putting community health at risk. Great rock selection isn’t worth ANY lives. Go here if you would like to be at risk.

The store was larger than I expected and even saw stones there that I had only read about. Excellent selection to choose from and the prices are sweet as well. Friendly and helpful staff. They even offer to teach classes if you request it in advance. Highly recommend you give this store a visit! Loved it 💖</Review>

Cool inventory and great place to waste time in if you like rocks.  The woman who was working was kind of rude and actually said that they didn't have any fossils, which they do... the owner finally came out front before I left and he was very sweet and knowledgeable about the different rocks.  Just think he needs a better staff that knows more about the inventory and how to talk to customers.  If I hadn't talked to her I would give the place 5 stars!!!</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>A real gem. I just had to use that. Explore tons of rocks and learn about everything from geology, chemistry, natural history, zoology, and geography, told by the owner of the store through the well-organized gems and fossils. Make your way through the intricately organize cases in the front, and discover the great rooms full of shelves of more rocks! Amazing to see this man and woman's life of exploring and collecting.< /Review>< name>

<Review>This place has everything from inexpensive souvenirs to high-dollar stuff. These folks are serious, real-deal. Pick up any of the thousands of rocks there, and they'll tell you what minerals it contains, their chemical composition, and how and where they're formed. They've traveled around the world to visit the locations of these stones, and will gladly tell you the stories behind them.</Review>< pictures>

Love this place! Amazing collection of stones, gems, artifacts, fossils. I walked out with lovely earrings for my wife & a 25mil year old whale vertebrae. Check out the wholesale section, too. Wow!< /Review>

I have been twice to stories in stone and both visits were great. Super friendly, best selection, and well priced. On my first visit I was fortunate enough to talk with one if the owners, Russ. He kindly shared some his extensive knowledge on paleontology, geology, and the items in the shop. I also overheard him being very patient and informative to a couple who had no interest in minerals but we're in the shop to see if something they had inherited was valuable.

My favorite thing about stories in stones is the learning center that is open for the public to explore. They also host field trips, workshops, and parties (if I remember correctly).

The learning center alone is worth the visit, but it will be difficult to resist the urge to bring something home.</Review>< pictures>

Russ is an experienced archaeologist who can tell you anything you've ever wanted to know about fossils, minerals and the thousands of unique items displayed. Souvenir for any price range $1-10000.  Huge chunks of pyrite for less than $10, Amythist geod for $5, really cool stuff.<//review>

Service is put off by people who look different (goth, punk, metalhead, etc...) Owner will rip you off if you have something of interest or withhold information about something that you may inquire about (example; if you inquire about a good place to find tourmaline - he'll mislead you or say there is none in this county). The items in the store are not native (not from around here). Over priced - I've been in a lot of stone dealer shops throughout the USA - this is a rip off.<//review>

<Review>This is the best rock and fosil store we have ever been to.  We can walk around the store for hours and look at everything more than once.  Everyone that works here is so nice and helpful. On our second trip to the Angel's Camp are my family looked forward to visiting this store more than anything else.  The prices are excellent and the inventory is always being updated. The owner is a wonderful man who truly has a gift for teaching.  He took us into the educational area and have my family a short version of the classes he gives to the school tours that come through. It is very fascinating to learn how much you and your daily life revolve around rocks and elements. The only disappointment we had was on our second visit the owner was not in the shop,  however the couple that was in charge of the store that day were fantastic. They have a wholesale section that is open to the public, you just have to add 50% to the wholesale price. Even with the 50% added on anything you could want is still a bargain. This place is not to be missed if in the Angel's Camp area.  I wish i could give them more than 5 stars we love this place so much.

Be sure to ask about the geode that still has the water in it. Very interesting this geode was never cracked by the earth so the water is still inside.  This rock is incredible. Solid rock sphere with liquid inside this is a must see at the shop.

We have not been here in about two years and we are definitely due for another trip there. I was way overdue for a review of this wonderful place.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Ordered a phone here June 29th. It was my birthday gift 😡. I was told it will take 3-5 days to reach. I waited for them to call me after a week I stop by the store only to see a sign on their door that’s says temporarily closed. Their customer service sucks. I made a down payment for the phone my account was charged and never got the phone. I called customer service and they will tell me the phone was sent back to warehouse, because they could t not deliver to the store July 2nd. It’s been over 2 weeks and I have yet to receive my refund. Plus if I was to reorder the phone over the phone even though I did not get my money back. I will have to pay the deposit again and they didn’t not have the color I originally ordered. Planning on switching to Verizon.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc7101e45d43d1:0x10beb92b4b8bb483< /gmap_id></record>

< review>
was a loyal customer for sprint for 8 years. I had to call sprint more than 10 times over the years, to please do something for our phone reception. Nothing happened just paying the bills and no service
My whole house we only had reception in part of my sons room. Finally 3 years ago they promised us to send us a device to boost the reception in our house
I’m guessing the package is lost in the mail and no matter how many times we called them they said it’s on the way. 2 months ago We finally decided to leave sprint to different company and they later sent us an angry text message that if you’re leaving our company you should pay penalty for your balance and your phones. We pay them $400 two weeks ago And ask them to give us 2 weeks to pay the rest $260 because of corona my business has to be in Mandatory close down. But still they send our file for Collection agency and destroyed my good credit score that I worked on it for years. You guys should Keep in mind that this corona time is going to be over but people still will remember what you’re doing to little people and tanks to Internet event little people have voice to tell you that we remember what you did in this difficult times to your Loyal customers People please have a little Research before trap yourself to these bloodthirsty  Companies
We will remember you<//review>

<Review>Amazing customer service! Went to this store to talk about possibly switching over from AT&T to Sprint, and ask some questions that I had. Saul helped me and was very knowledgeable about all the plans and even took the time to look into my situation and figure out what was best for me and my family. I left with 4 new lines and a big smile on my face. If you want to be treated right with quality customer service then come to this Sprint store. Best sprint store in Oceanside!<//Review>< Rating>

Came in to get a phone for myself and my daughter....walked out with not only our phones but BIG smiles. Saul was amazinggggg, not only did he give great customer service he also was so personable and took the time to get to know us and our needs to match us with the best phone for us!

He was so attentive and figured out why was going on so fast! He even tested and retested my phone to make sure it didn't mess up again!

First of all, they were unable to fix my issue and blamed the lack of service to a hardware problem (blamed Apple because I had iPhone) the manager, I don’t recall a name, just older guy grayish hair and a goatee I believe, had some horrible things to say about Apple. Calling them expletives and telling me, in the rudest way possible, that I had to take my phone in there because its broken and they will give me a new one. Well long story short.. it was Sprints issue to begin with, a new wild issue, I will give them that. But I just wanted to comment on how terrible the customer service has been when dealing with this sprint. The other Sprint store I went to wasn’t any better. So as you can see, I’m not happy at all with these issues. This Store has the absolute worst manager I’ve ever dealt with. And that’s saying a lot because I’ve been in the service industry for about 8 years now..<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Courteous and friendly service. Not being familiar with options it is hard to trust that these "sales" people would have your best interest in mind. From the manager to the new trainee, all professional. I would recommend this store to all my sprint family members.< /text>

Walked in and was greeted immediately by Alma.  She was informative and answered all of our questions.  Because of her great customer service I decided to get my phone upgrade here at the Sprint Store off of Douglas & Hwy 76.  Alma reviewed our account in order to make sure we had the best service for our $$...I highly recommend this location while there we witnessed great customer service from Alma and all of her colleagues!< /text>

Great experience this week. Totally killed my iPhone 6 screen and David went out of his way to take care of me.  Didn't get a phone that day had to order it. But soon as it got in they call me.  I came back in to pick up phone and it was going to take a while to transfer data.  Chad really made me feel comfortable. Even offer me lunch while I waited. This is we I continue to come back to this location.  Lastly they are always making me laugh.  Great family environment, I will always come back and send other to this location.  Thank Chad and David for a great customer experience!

Came in today trying to switch from Verizon and possibly get a new phone, Saul T. helped me out and pretty much set up everything for me! Super knowledgable and made it stress free for me to make the change. Had an awesome experience for once when usually messing with phones is a total headache. Would highly recommend this location for any needs!< /text>

<Review>This store has been our go-to ever since my husband and I moved to Oceanside. They always provide exceptional service and always assist us with whatever questions or concerns we have. I came in today to get an iPhone 6 since I was overdue for an upgrade and one of the associates Alma helped me out with the whole process in a good amount of time. I was in and out in no time and I'm very content with the service given :)</Review>< Date>

Chad and Saul are the best! They were helpful, professional, and gave us a great deal. They patiently explained the features, types of service available, and even stayed late to help us out. I highly recommend this store!<//Text>

The service with Sprint is horrible... They always lie to you. I was told that I could return their phones to any of their stores but it turns out that the man at the store refused to take them back... I had called sprint before coming here to make sure I could but it was just a waste of time. I called Sprint again and got no clear answer when I told them that I was standing outside the store after 45 mins they just ended the call. Don't get service with Sprint they will rip you off and lie to you on top of it.</Text>

The manager named Chad helped me out by setting me up with a new case and screen protector so that I can be better prepared to prevent it from happening again. The service here was great. I felt like they really cared about the situation and who wouldn't like that kind of service.<//review>< Pictures>

There is always a wait even for the simplest request. They're not a corporate store so they can't do too much. They always refer you to the corporate store by bed bath and beyond. All they want to do is sell phones.< /text>

Best service I've ever had at a phone store! Jordyn was especially helpful in getting my mom a new phone! And the manager got me a new phone ordered for no cost because my current phone had some issues. Their service is great, and this will definitely be my go-to sprint store now :) Thanks Jordyn!!</Review>

I just transferred from Verizon and was kindly & professionally assisted in what became a huge cost saving event.
I'm very pleased with my Samsung Galaxy S7, but i could have bought that phone anywhere. What i am most pleased about is how carefully & completely Rachel M. explainex my new plan and set up my phone.
Ill be recommending Store #1041 and Rachel M. in particular to all my friends.
Best service & product. No room for improvement.<//text>

First time writing a review ever. Decided to step into the sprint store to kill some time while my tuna fries that were cooking next door. This is where I ran into sprint associate Ray. First off I’m pretty stingy when it comes to spending money. I normally read a lot of reviews (yes I’m that guy where I read tons of reviews but never leave one) that end up being the make it or break it for me purchasing a new item. When it comes to getting a new phone however you always see stores advertising great deals but you always get killed with the fine print. So I always rely on the sales associate word and hope for the best. Ray was everything you could ask for. He wasn’t worried about getting you to sign the most expensive contract, wasn’t trying to push you into anything, etc. He was truly there to just give you the best possible advice and save you the most money. Ray was extremely knowledgeable on all deals sprint has to offer. There is some fees that make me cringe, activation fee of roughly 30$ specifically. I mean I pay 30$ for them to push a button pretty much (or least that’s how I see it). But Ray was there to save the day. After paying all my fees of around 130$ (I ended up upgrading to the IPhone X) I was kinda of bummed but knew that was the cheapest price I was walking out of there because Ray was a straight shooter. Best part about working with Ray was again, he was super knowledgeable of all sprints “not so advertised deals” and ended up walking out of the store with close to 100$ of phone accessories, a case and screen protector. Now I was sitting there like okay, Ray just hit me with what most likely every single employee tries to hit you with, you sign here I’m going to “hook you up” with all these free things. But the thing was there was a customer who was sitting next to me working with another sales associate that was going through an identical process as myself, meaning same contract, trading in the same phone, upgrading to the X. I was being noisy and paying attention to them and noticed that customer wasn’t getting the same deals as I was. Ray asked me if he could step aside for a moment to help out the other customer to save them the same money he saved me (sales associate didn’t know of a special going on). Hands down Ray provided me with the best customer service I have ever received and would highly recommend seeing him for any future purchases through Sprint.</review>

<Text>Mykala is the best hands down! Her immediate service and spectacular knowledge of products, promotions, phones, data and usage is beyond what I needed. Great customer service, definitely let me know if I had any issues to give her a direct call for her help. I give an outstanding rating cause of her :) and thanks again Mykala I'm seriously obsessed with my new phone!! The energy and vibe was also amazing, everyone is so friendly and nice :)<//Text>< Resp>

We had a phone problem and were worried that it wouldn't get fixed. We came into this store and the manger Chad helped us. I have never been more satisfied with customer service. He was a great help and got us everything we needed. We will definitely be coming back and we love sprint! Thanks for the help!!<//text>

Saul & Zach were very professional, kind and friendly. I have been a customer with Sprint for 13 years and this was the best customer service I have ever received. I highly would recommend this Sprint store to anyone requiring services.<//Review>

We had a very good experience at this Sprint store. We weren't satisfied with our AT&T service so we came to see what our options were to switch. They gave us a better price and we even got a few freebies out of it!</Review>

My phone is having issues and the "solutions" I was given were pay $260 to pay off my broken phone or pay $200 to fix it (I have insurance on it) or pay for another phone and phone line. How about No? Not helpful and everyone was totally rude. Looking to switch to a different carrier on Monday. 😡</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Best service I've ever had at a phone store! Jordyn was especially helpful in getting my mom a new phone! And the manager got me a new phone ordered for no cost because my current phone had some issues. Their service is great, and this will definitely be my go-to sprint store now :) Thanks Jordyn!!< /Text>

Came here to exchange items bought at a sister store and was told they couldn't exchange or return them and had to go to the other store over an hour away. Total BS. Makes Sprint look bad and definitely staying away from the company that owns these Sprint stores.<//text>

<text>Not a fan of this location anymore. I came in a few months ago because my phone refused to charge at all. I figured the charging port was loose or something else simple. There is never a tech there, I’ve had to go in before, and I’m also not a fan of having to leave my phone in complete stranger’s hands for several days either.  So being at the mercy of this store, I reluctantly leave my HTC One M8 overnight. Chad tells us we will be contacted when the tech is done. My husband calls me at work, since my phone is “in the shop” to tell me he was told there was water damage and I would need to get another phone. This was crap so I called the store to make sure they hadn’t got my phone mixed up with someone else’s.  Chad tells me he’s got the right phone, more crap, and that there was water damage and I would need a new phone. I jet on over after work to get my phone because I believe the tech, Nate or whatever his name is, doesn’t know what he’s doing or got my phone mixed up with another phone. I get there, of course no tech, and they give back my phone and try to tell me all the different ways that water damage can occur…blah, blah, blah. They try again to tell me I will need another phone because there was “water damage” and won’t find a cheaper plan anywhere else. I took my happy ass to the Sprint store in Murrieta for a second opinion and man I’m glad I did. They had 3…THREE!!!...techs on sight ready to work on a weeknight, I think it was around 530-6pm.  The tech working with me said he only needed to charge for an hour and do a soft start/boot and it was working fine again. I asked out of curiosity if there was anything wrong internally like “water damage” and he said there was nothing indicating that!  So I highly discourage the techs at the Sprint there in O-side or just Nate because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  FYI, I still have my phone and it’s still working fine :D</text>< Pictures>

Worst store experience ever! Staff very unprofessional. No respect for customer privacy. As I was trying to resolve an issue with unlocking my phone and paying a bill. The staff with no regards to customers present and my children continued to drop the f bomb complainig about other staff resetting a phone download she was trying to complete for a "stupid lady since yesterday. " The girl "helping me" was so concerned to listen to her co worker gripe she could not focus on my credit card payment and had to run my credit card 3 times because she punched in the wrong numbers. During these 25mins I witnessed other employees sharing about other annoying customers to each other and with willing participating customers. Beware! I know it happens but at least be discreet out of respect for the paying customers who contributed to your wages!</Text>

Also handed them my last t mobile bill statement and was told he (the manager) would put it in the system so we can get our visa card buyback money. Not only did he not put it in the sprint system, he lied about the iwatch reimbursement and i called 2 other times wondering if they had let sprint know about my last bill from t mobile. One time they didn't call back when they took my number down, then another time they told me it went through and we should be getting it soon. I had to call corporate and they had never received registration from both my devices so they could send out the visa refund cards. Then they informed me i would get nothing towards the apple watch. The manager is who i dealt with the most, he obviously is just telling people things and not doing a thing about it. Thanks for wasting my time, its been 5 months and still no rebate for switching over to sprint. I highy recommend you go to a different sprint store.<//Text>< Resp>

<review>I went in on a Tuesday afternoon to drop off my Samsung S7 edge that had a blinking green and black sleep mode (standby) screen. Occasionally, when the phone heats up it will flash all white.It wasn't too busy but I had things to do so I left it there for a couple hours. Came back after 3 hours & I was told my phone had corrosion in the charging port & throughout the inside of my phone. I was a little furious because I just got a brand new phone (upgraded from S5) in July. This phone is just 8 weeks old & NO, I DID NOT SUBJECT my phone to any liquids or water. The technician who "opened" my phone was named Sayuri. I can tell I got under her skin because I wanted her to show me the "corrosion" as I assured her that was not the problem. But hey, what do I know, I'm not the " Sprint Certified Technician". She told me it would take 45 minutes to re-open the phone to show me the damage (red  flag #1) also, because it has "Visible water damage" around the phone (again, I asked them to show me where and they were looking at the edge of the screen protector shield! Red flag #2) & they noticed the back of the phone to have had some kind of substance on there. Yeah, It's August people( summer!) Peoples hands sweat & without a case it will show prints of some sort but certainly not a LIQUID substance.Then, she added, IF THERE IS VISIBLE SIGNS OF WATER, LIQUID (or god forbid your phone is dented or scratched) They "ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OPEN THE PHONE AND DIAGNOSE THE PHONE", (per rules of their franchise-RED FLAG #3- which in my case was what pushed me over the edge for further investigation). She continued to say that since the phone is corroded, I would have to pay $200 for a replacement from my insurance. What!? IT'S A NEW PHONE PLUS, Your girl (me) has done her research... go on youtube, or google... you will see other people had this same issue after a few weeks of use. I told her it is a internal problem. She did however say, I can go to Best Buy and have a Samsung representative open the phone for me and show me the damage and have them try to fix it. (THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THESE PEOPLE HAS SENT ME ELSEWHERE FOR A PROBLEM)  So, like an idiot, I go to Best Buy. Any person will know that because the phone was not purchased at BB, they can't fix it. That's exactly what the guy told me. He was a VERY NICE guy however, and did say THIS IS NOT WATER DAMAGE, It is a internal motherboard malfunction. I had to mail the phone to Samsung HQ in TX & it will take 15 days to get a replacement FOR FREE since it's under a manufacture warranty. I need a phone asap so I went all the way to Encinitas Corporate store. Guess what? In about an hour, the tech said it was a motherboard problem and as soon as he opened the phone, the phone completely fried. They were able to order me a replacement FOR FREE! So, Why did this store make me want to pay $200? Why couldn't they help me out like Encinitas did? Why did Sayuri lie to me and said she opened it when she didn't? What was the corrosion she saw? Either these people need their eyes checked, or get a technician that actually looks at phones. I counted on this Sprint store (on Douglas) to be able to help me because they are right around the corner from my home. Instead they send people away to other places. Before this issue, I went in to this store in June because I needed to cancel my account and add me to my husbands account so we can have just 1 bill, they sent me to the corporate store on Vista way because this Douglas store is not able to do a transfer of ownership. The store on Vista way said they are unable to help and that procedure is done online!  Anyways, I went back to Sprint-Douglas & asked for the name and number for the regional manager. The associate went to the back and I guess spoke to another Sprint team member and he came back out and said they are not allowed to give the name and number for the Sprint Regional Manager. WOW!! RED FLAG (I am about to loose count here- #4).< /review><date>1472707207038< /date><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

Ordered a phone here June 29th. It was my birthday gift 😡. I was told it will take 3-5 days to reach. I waited for them to call me after a week I stop by the store only to see a sign on their door that’s says temporarily closed. Their customer service sucks. I made a down payment for the phone my account was charged and never got the phone. I called customer service and they will tell me the phone was sent back to warehouse, because they could t not deliver to the store July 2nd. It’s been over 2 weeks and I have yet to receive my refund. Plus if I was to reorder the phone over the phone even though I did not get my money back. I will have to pay the deposit again and they didn’t not have the color I originally ordered. Planning on switching to Verizon.</text>

<text>Went in yesterday to pay off my phone and ended up purchasing two new phones on a great deal!  Brandon and Sandra were awesome and kept me informed during the phone set up process.  They both provided quick and responsive customer service.  I am thankful for their attention and for being nice and helpful.  I would recommend anyone to this store and specifically to Brandon and Sandra.  Thank you again!  Sincerely, Jose< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>was a loyal customer for sprint for 8 years. I had to call sprint more than 10 times over the years, to please do something for our phone reception. Nothing happened just paying the bills and no service
My whole house we only had reception in part of my sons room. Finally 3 years ago they promised us to send us a device to boost the reception in our house
I’m guessing the package is lost in the mail and no matter how many times we called them they said it’s on the way. 2 months ago We finally decided to leave sprint to different company and they later sent us an angry text message that if you’re leaving our company you should pay penalty for your balance and your phones. We pay them $400 two weeks ago And ask them to give us 2 weeks to pay the rest $260 because of corona my business has to be in Mandatory close down. But still they send our file for Collection agency and destroyed my good credit score that I worked on it for years. You guys should Keep in mind that this corona time is going to be over but people still will remember what you’re doing to little people and tanks to Internet event little people have voice to tell you that we remember what you did in this difficult times to your Loyal customers People please have a little Research before trap yourself to these bloodthirsty  Companies
We will remember you</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Chad, the store manager, is by far one of the best customer oriented person I have ever met! He stayed well after they were closed to make sure we were taken care of and left happy! I will continue to go to this location because I am confident that Chad and his fellow sidekicks like David, will continue to provided the best customer experience! His knowledge and confidence in the product is amazing! And he genuinely cared about making sure I was taken care of to the best of his ability .... And beyond! Thanks Sprint for having people like Chad and David representing your products and service.. They ROCK!</Review>

Amazing customer service! Went to this store to talk about possibly switching over from AT&T to Sprint, and ask some questions that I had. Saul helped me and was very knowledgeable about all the plans and even took the time to look into my situation and figure out what was best for me and my family. I left with 4 new lines and a big smile on my face. If you want to be treated right with quality customer service then come to this Sprint store. Best sprint store in Oceanside!</review>

Just recently went in for an upgrade, husband ended up walking out with a 6s plus as well. Glad to know they have people that help out their customers and go above and beyond to make sure the customer is pleased. Alma and Chad were incredible with their professionalism and help!<//text>

< Review>
I only gave them one star because I had to give them some kind of rating. First of all, they were unable to fix my issue and blamed the lack of service to a hardware problem (blamed Apple because I had iPhone) the manager, I don’t recall a name, just older guy grayish hair and a goatee I believe, had some horrible things to say about Apple. Calling them expletives and telling me, in the rudest way possible, that I had to take my phone in there because its broken and they will give me a new one. Well long story short.. it was Sprints issue to begin with, a new wild issue, I will give them that. But I just wanted to comment on how terrible the customer service has been when dealing with this sprint. The other Sprint store I went to wasn’t any better. So as you can see, I’m not happy at all with these issues. This Store has the absolute worst manager I’ve ever dealt with. And that’s saying a lot because I’ve been in the service industry for about 8 years now..<//Review>

Courteous and friendly service. Not being familiar with options it is hard to trust that these "sales" people would have your best interest in mind. From the manager to the new trainee, all professional. I would recommend this store to all my sprint family members.<//Text>

<review>Walked in and was greeted immediately by Alma.  She was informative and answered all of our questions.  Because of her great customer service I decided to get my phone upgrade here at the Sprint Store off of Douglas & Hwy 76.  Alma reviewed our account in order to make sure we had the best service for our $$...I highly recommend this location while there we witnessed great customer service from Alma and all of her colleagues!< /review>< Pictures>

Great experience this week. Totally killed my iPhone 6 screen and David went out of his way to take care of me.  Didn't get a phone that day had to order it. But soon as it got in they call me.  I came back in to pick up phone and it was going to take a while to transfer data.  Chad really made me feel comfortable. Even offer me lunch while I waited. This is we I continue to come back to this location.  Lastly they are always making me laugh.  Great family environment, I will always come back and send other to this location.  Thank Chad and David for a great customer experience!

<Review>Came in today trying to switch from Verizon and possibly get a new phone, Saul T. helped me out and pretty much set up everything for me! Super knowledgable and made it stress free for me to make the change. Had an awesome experience for once when usually messing with phones is a total headache. Would highly recommend this location for any needs!<//Review>< Pics>

Excellent customer service! Alma a store sales rep went above and beyond to assist me in analyzing my bill and helping me lower the cost of my overall plan. I was also able to upgrade to the Galaxy S7 and she helped transfer all of my data from my old phone to my new one. I highly recommend this store and make sure you see Alma, she's the best there is!< /Review>

This store has been our go-to ever since my husband and I moved to Oceanside. They always provide exceptional service and always assist us with whatever questions or concerns we have. I came in today to get an iPhone 6 since I was overdue for an upgrade and one of the associates Alma helped me out with the whole process in a good amount of time. I was in and out in no time and I'm very content with the service given :)</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>The service with Sprint is horrible... They always lie to you. I was told that I could return their phones to any of their stores but it turns out that the man at the store refused to take them back... I had called sprint before coming here to make sure I could but it was just a waste of time. I called Sprint again and got no clear answer when I told them that I was standing outside the store after 45 mins they just ended the call. Don't get service with Sprint they will rip you off and lie to you on top of it.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80dc7101e45d43d1:0x10beb92b4b8bb483< /gmapID><date>1559259860933< /date>< Resp>

<review>My Android had a cracked screen and needed it fixed fast. Sayuri helped me out quick. She was really nice and quick to help with the situation. The manager named Chad helped me out by setting me up with a new case and screen protector so that I can be better prepared to prevent it from happening again. The service here was great. I felt like they really cared about the situation and who wouldn't like that kind of service.<//review>< resp>

Best service I've ever had at a phone store! Jordyn was especially helpful in getting my mom a new phone! And the manager got me a new phone ordered for no cost because my current phone had some issues. Their service is great, and this will definitely be my go-to sprint store now :) Thanks Jordyn!!< /Text>

I just transferred from Verizon and was kindly & professionally assisted in what became a huge cost saving event.
I'm very pleased with my Samsung Galaxy S7, but i could have bought that phone anywhere. What i am most pleased about is how carefully & completely Rachel M. explainex my new plan and set up my phone.
Ill be recommending Store #1041 and Rachel M. in particular to all my friends.
Best service & product. No room for improvement.</text>

First time writing a review ever. Decided to step into the sprint store to kill some time while my tuna fries that were cooking next door. This is where I ran into sprint associate Ray. First off I’m pretty stingy when it comes to spending money. I normally read a lot of reviews (yes I’m that guy where I read tons of reviews but never leave one) that end up being the make it or break it for me purchasing a new item. When it comes to getting a new phone however you always see stores advertising great deals but you always get killed with the fine print. So I always rely on the sales associate word and hope for the best. Ray was everything you could ask for. He wasn’t worried about getting you to sign the most expensive contract, wasn’t trying to push you into anything, etc. He was truly there to just give you the best possible advice and save you the most money. Ray was extremely knowledgeable on all deals sprint has to offer. There is some fees that make me cringe, activation fee of roughly 30$ specifically. I mean I pay 30$ for them to push a button pretty much (or least that’s how I see it). But Ray was there to save the day. After paying all my fees of around 130$ (I ended up upgrading to the IPhone X) I was kinda of bummed but knew that was the cheapest price I was walking out of there because Ray was a straight shooter. Best part about working with Ray was again, he was super knowledgeable of all sprints “not so advertised deals” and ended up walking out of the store with close to 100$ of phone accessories, a case and screen protector. Now I was sitting there like okay, Ray just hit me with what most likely every single employee tries to hit you with, you sign here I’m going to “hook you up” with all these free things. But the thing was there was a customer who was sitting next to me working with another sales associate that was going through an identical process as myself, meaning same contract, trading in the same phone, upgrading to the X. I was being noisy and paying attention to them and noticed that customer wasn’t getting the same deals as I was. Ray asked me if he could step aside for a moment to help out the other customer to save them the same money he saved me (sales associate didn’t know of a special going on). Hands down Ray provided me with the best customer service I have ever received and would highly recommend seeing him for any future purchases through Sprint.<//review>

My phone is having issues and the "solutions" I was given were pay $260 to pay off my broken phone or pay $200 to fix it (I have insurance on it) or pay for another phone and phone line. How about No? Not helpful and everyone was totally rude. Looking to switch to a different carrier on Monday. 😡<//review>< Date>

<Review>There is always a wait even for the simplest request. They're not a corporate store so they can't do too much. They always refer you to the corporate store by bed bath and beyond. All they want to do is sell phones.<//Review><Date>1452733223025<//Date><gmapID>0x80dc7101e45d43d1:0x10beb92b4b8bb483<//gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< user_name>

<review>Best service I've ever had at a phone store! Jordyn was especially helpful in getting my mom a new phone! And the manager got me a new phone ordered for no cost because my current phone had some issues. Their service is great, and this will definitely be my go-to sprint store now :) Thanks Jordyn!!<//review>< pics>

Alma helped me solve the problem on my phone and was very fun to talk to and always smiling. Sprint in Oceanside is the best one to go to. Every worker knows what to do and helps you out the best they can.<//Text>

If you want the best service when it comes to any matter involving your sprint device I recommend going to sprint on Douglas Dr. I've recently destroyed my phone beyond repair and Alma one of the sales associate got me a great deal on a iPhone 6+. Excellent service and friendly staff..< /review>

<text>Not a fan of this location anymore. I came in a few months ago because my phone refused to charge at all. I figured the charging port was loose or something else simple. There is never a tech there, I’ve had to go in before, and I’m also not a fan of having to leave my phone in complete stranger’s hands for several days either.  So being at the mercy of this store, I reluctantly leave my HTC One M8 overnight. Chad tells us we will be contacted when the tech is done. My husband calls me at work, since my phone is “in the shop” to tell me he was told there was water damage and I would need to get another phone. This was crap so I called the store to make sure they hadn’t got my phone mixed up with someone else’s.  Chad tells me he’s got the right phone, more crap, and that there was water damage and I would need a new phone. I jet on over after work to get my phone because I believe the tech, Nate or whatever his name is, doesn’t know what he’s doing or got my phone mixed up with another phone. I get there, of course no tech, and they give back my phone and try to tell me all the different ways that water damage can occur…blah, blah, blah. They try again to tell me I will need another phone because there was “water damage” and won’t find a cheaper plan anywhere else. I took my happy ass to the Sprint store in Murrieta for a second opinion and man I’m glad I did. They had 3…THREE!!!...techs on sight ready to work on a weeknight, I think it was around 530-6pm.  The tech working with me said he only needed to charge for an hour and do a soft start/boot and it was working fine again. I asked out of curiosity if there was anything wrong internally like “water damage” and he said there was nothing indicating that!  So I highly discourage the techs at the Sprint there in O-side or just Nate because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  FYI, I still have my phone and it’s still working fine :D</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

Worst store experience ever! Staff very unprofessional. No respect for customer privacy. As I was trying to resolve an issue with unlocking my phone and paying a bill. The staff with no regards to customers present and my children continued to drop the f bomb complainig about other staff resetting a phone download she was trying to complete for a "stupid lady since yesterday. " The girl "helping me" was so concerned to listen to her co worker gripe she could not focus on my credit card payment and had to run my credit card 3 times because she punched in the wrong numbers. During these 25mins I witnessed other employees sharing about other annoying customers to each other and with willing participating customers. Beware! I know it happens but at least be discreet out of respect for the paying customers who contributed to your wages!</text>

Switched from t mobile, was told i would need 3 lines and would get re embursed for our iwatch. Also handed them my last t mobile bill statement and was told he (the manager) would put it in the system so we can get our visa card buyback money. Not only did he not put it in the sprint system, he lied about the iwatch reimbursement and i called 2 other times wondering if they had let sprint know about my last bill from t mobile. One time they didn't call back when they took my number down, then another time they told me it went through and we should be getting it soon. I had to call corporate and they had never received registration from both my devices so they could send out the visa refund cards. Then they informed me i would get nothing towards the apple watch. The manager is who i dealt with the most, he obviously is just telling people things and not doing a thing about it. Thanks for wasting my time, its been 5 months and still no rebate for switching over to sprint. I highy recommend you go to a different sprint store.<//text>

<review>I went in on a Tuesday afternoon to drop off my Samsung S7 edge that had a blinking green and black sleep mode (standby) screen. Occasionally, when the phone heats up it will flash all white.It wasn't too busy but I had things to do so I left it there for a couple hours. Came back after 3 hours & I was told my phone had corrosion in the charging port & throughout the inside of my phone. I was a little furious because I just got a brand new phone (upgraded from S5) in July. This phone is just 8 weeks old & NO, I DID NOT SUBJECT my phone to any liquids or water. The technician who "opened" my phone was named Sayuri. I can tell I got under her skin because I wanted her to show me the "corrosion" as I assured her that was not the problem. But hey, what do I know, I'm not the " Sprint Certified Technician". She told me it would take 45 minutes to re-open the phone to show me the damage (red  flag #1) also, because it has "Visible water damage" around the phone (again, I asked them to show me where and they were looking at the edge of the screen protector shield! Red flag #2) & they noticed the back of the phone to have had some kind of substance on there. Yeah, It's August people( summer!) Peoples hands sweat & without a case it will show prints of some sort but certainly not a LIQUID substance.Then, she added, IF THERE IS VISIBLE SIGNS OF WATER, LIQUID (or god forbid your phone is dented or scratched) They "ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OPEN THE PHONE AND DIAGNOSE THE PHONE", (per rules of their franchise-RED FLAG #3- which in my case was what pushed me over the edge for further investigation). She continued to say that since the phone is corroded, I would have to pay $200 for a replacement from my insurance. What!? IT'S A NEW PHONE PLUS, Your girl (me) has done her research... go on youtube, or google... you will see other people had this same issue after a few weeks of use. I told her it is a internal problem. She did however say, I can go to Best Buy and have a Samsung representative open the phone for me and show me the damage and have them try to fix it. (THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THESE PEOPLE HAS SENT ME ELSEWHERE FOR A PROBLEM)  So, like an idiot, I go to Best Buy. Any person will know that because the phone was not purchased at BB, they can't fix it. That's exactly what the guy told me. He was a VERY NICE guy however, and did say THIS IS NOT WATER DAMAGE, It is a internal motherboard malfunction. I had to mail the phone to Samsung HQ in TX & it will take 15 days to get a replacement FOR FREE since it's under a manufacture warranty. I need a phone asap so I went all the way to Encinitas Corporate store. Guess what? In about an hour, the tech said it was a motherboard problem and as soon as he opened the phone, the phone completely fried. They were able to order me a replacement FOR FREE! So, Why did this store make me want to pay $200? Why couldn't they help me out like Encinitas did? Why did Sayuri lie to me and said she opened it when she didn't? What was the corrosion she saw? Either these people need their eyes checked, or get a technician that actually looks at phones. I counted on this Sprint store (on Douglas) to be able to help me because they are right around the corner from my home. Instead they send people away to other places. Before this issue, I went in to this store in June because I needed to cancel my account and add me to my husbands account so we can have just 1 bill, they sent me to the corporate store on Vista way because this Douglas store is not able to do a transfer of ownership. The store on Vista way said they are unable to help and that procedure is done online!  Anyways, I went back to Sprint-Douglas & asked for the name and number for the regional manager. The associate went to the back and I guess spoke to another Sprint team member and he came back out and said they are not allowed to give the name and number for the Sprint Regional Manager. WOW!! RED FLAG (I am about to loose count here- #4).</review>< pics>

If you want the best service when it comes to any matter involving your sprint device I recommend going to sprint on Douglas Dr. I've recently destroyed my phone beyond repair and Alma one of the sales associate got me a great deal on a iPhone 6+. Excellent service and friendly staff..<//Review>

I’ve been coming to Magnuson since 2007.. I have had tint installed on two Camry’s , Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Chrysler 300..., And today I’m installing an upgraded sound system on my 2019 Toyota Tacoma... never had a problem. My family and I don’t go anywhere else.< /text>

This place is not worth your time or money. I got my windows done a little over a month ago and now there is little air pockets popping up. I have the warranty so i called to see what i can do and this grown man answers. I tell him about the air pockets and before i can finish my sentence he cuts me off and decides he wants to get loud telling me i need my receipt. Uh ok sir i have my receipt but after your tantrum i will be taking my business to an actual professional. They couldn't get it right the first time so why should i bother the second time especially when dealing with such rude shady people.</text>

Love this spot, got my passenger window shattered today from a break-in and fixed by this shop like new in a couple hours. Guys are super friendly and answered all my questions. They did a great job with cleaning all the glass shards inside as well. 10/10 would recommend<//review>

Window tint started to bubble shortly after getting my full car tinted. The owner does not honor the “ lifetime warranty “ they were very unprofessional when I tried to get the bubbled tint redone. This place might be cheap but the work is not good and the shop does not stand by its lifetime warranty.< /Review>

This place has great deals, and the staff are nice, the tint came out perfectly they did tell me not to roll down my windows for 2 days which is fine for me, I also know that you should not take it to a car wash until after 24hrs, all in all great service I recommend this place to all. Happy Holidays Everyone 🎉<//text>

<review>These dudes right here know their stuff about cars for sure. They have the best deals for tint, audio, glass, and custom work hands down. I was there while they were customizing a sound system on a Chevy lowrider & I was very impressed with their work and style. specially on how they worked to please that customer. Just great vibes when you meet the owner and it's staff. Lancelot is the man if you want to get a great deal and guaranteed work on your vehicle. I highly recommend this place.<//review>< pics>

Just had my car's rear windows tinted dark by Magnuson Window Tinting. They did an excellent window tinting job. Now I am going to get more work done to the car, vinyl wrap of the roof.  They are always busy with all kinds of different cars and clientele, a very good sign. They also take great pride in their work. Very happy I found this auto glass shop!</Review>

Our passenger window fell down into the door.  We called our mechanic and asked for an estimate and he quoted us a much higher price.

This company doesn't stand by their word and they don't care about the customer. I spoke with the  Manager who said a few months ago if I'm not able to find my receipt that shows a had lifetime warranty to come back and he will give me a discount to redo the work for all of my front windows are peeling. After a couple months and failed to be able to find my receipt I called to schedule and to check on the price with the discount the receptionist who handled the call refuse to even acknowlege the possibility of giving me a discount and said that either they give the current coupon value and that's all that they could give which I found to be acceptable for this is because I am bringing back a vehicle that did not hold up on quality of work to get there not willing to stand by it the woman was very rude not sure she's related to the business owner but if she is not related to the business owner she really represented them horribly as an employee do not go here horrible service</review>

Got my windows, headlights and taillights  tinted, looked very nice, and came with warranties! I also got a subwoofer installed and better speakers , was pleased with the set up very clean, and has fuses. My speakers did blow out within the first week but they gave me no trouble replacing those with better speakers all under warranty. I loved the lifetime warranty for there suntek tints and the fact that the Audio system has a warranty is great, it is a year. Also front tinting on lights have 5 year warranty. Got the back taillights redone under warranty because rain damage. Honored my warranties with no problem. I had my suspicions but they really came through we’re i needed them too. Will update review after seeing how the new speakers are. But so far pleased with the customer service.</Text>

My friend was waiting for me because other places I called told me it would take 2-3 hours to take off so I assumed it would been the same here but nope!

<Review>I had auto glass tinting 3 weeks ago. I made an appointment about a week earlier and chose the type of tint we would use. I took my car to their shop and left to have some business done. 2 hours later Mr Juarez called me to say the car is ready. Window tinting was care-free and I am happy with the end result.<//Review></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I've had a lot of experience with broken windows, I've gone to many different auto glass repair shops. After a car collision the car needed the windshield replaced. After calling insurance, they recommended me to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass and I scheduled an appointment. They did an excellent job cleaning and did the auto glass installation all in an hour while I grabbed lunch down the street.<//Review>< user_name>

< Review>
It was horrible guy asked me to leave my car over night because he was going to get started on it. So I did because I didn't go to work till the afternoon he said he would call me to give me a status update and he didn't. That regardless my car would b ready before 10am. When it was time for me to go to work I stopped by and they were barely getting started on my car and that was 2:30pm .....I was so mad I even lost time of work and when my car was finally ready he had the nerve to say he don't have to give me a discount but he was anyways...well now theirs bubbles on my windows when I rolled down my windows their was glue inside my door panels that rubbed on my windows it was hard to take off.. and on top of it all they left a mess in my car Lil pieces of tint all over. I'm no happy at all I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!  They did a sloppy ass job. Should of went to LA for the prize I paid lol<//Review>

Went in there they tinted my Windows and there was still bubbles weeks later so I went back and they re did them yet again there is still bubbles. Expensive yet their work doesnt speak for the price. Steer clear.</Text>

Such a helpful place, located at a very convenient area. If it wasn’t so convenient I would be using fedex or ups. The convenient of this place is what brings me here, however the excellent customer service is what keeps me here. If you have package to send overseas, this is the place to be. More post office should be run like this. People with smiley faces, it’s like they love their job. They seem to have such friendly people, that want you in and out quicker than usual. This post office does not delay you, they move quicker than any post office I ever been to. Overall, I recommend these people. I travel 20 minutes to just come here because of their excellent service. This place put most post office to shame. Whoever run this, must be very knowledgeable. I recommend this place if it’s a under 30 minute drive to this location. Then it’s worth the drive.< /Text>

I've used this location a few times to mail out packages.
I like that they are open late.
I like that they validate parking, so if you need to park in the shopping center, go inside, buy some postage stamps, and get your parking validated.
I've had very friendly service by the employees I've encountered at the location.
I don't like that this places is very cluttered with packages often out in the open.  I'm sure they have cameras monitoring the packages, but it looks like it would be possible for someone to swipe a package or two without anyone noticing, so if you're mailing out anything valuable, beware!</text>

I am not a local here but, I happened to be in the neighborhood and needed to mail out two international letters to two different locations in europe.

(mind you that this is not my first time sending out international letters to these two addresses) I remember vividly the time and date I sent out these letters. Dec. 29. 2017 9:30 am. I spoke to a lady there to ask them where I should drop them off and she told me to drop it off at the little mailbox compartment they had indoors. It is now Feb.6th 2018 and both locations- one in Ireland and one in Scotland both did not receive the letter!!!!!!!!!!!!! UGH and its not like I wrote something simple. It was an accumulation of meaningful letters. Also, nobody picks up the phone if you try to call.

First time I came here it was terrible. Additude and slow service. Slowly but surely everytime I came back it was better and better. The two gentlemen literally saved this place with their great service and help never ran into problems with them. I feel they need a bigger facility because they're always being bombarded with packages and someone to help them organize.<//Text>

This USPS is by far one of the most excellent post offices.  Peter goes above and beyond what normal post offices will do for you.  He really personalizes each transaction and makes everyone feel like family.  They even provide services that are absolutely unheard of, although I won't mention any because I think he does it just out of the kindness of his heart.  Feel free to go up the street to the one next to Union Station on Vignes street if you really want to deal with rude lazy postal clerks.  The lines there are always long and they expect you to know everything about processing mail prior to being serviced.<//Review>

Service is decent but the place is a mess and they don't always have all stamps.  Worst sin is the hours posted on maps says they open at 8:30 and sign on window says 9:00 but it's now 9:30 and they're still not open!  What gives!</review>

I don't care about the mess & yes there's always a mess when u go in there, some days are worse than others & other days they've "tidy" it up a bit. Peter can b brisk at times but I get along w/ him fine, if u have a strong personality then he tends to b more courteous & he can even speak Japanese! This place has always gotten my packages & mail delivered on time if not early which is why I always use them & stopped using the 1 that's actually near me all the way in Downey off of Firestone Blvd! If u want your mail & packages delivered on time to whatever destination this is the post office to go to. Also the hours aren't always clear as to how late they're open til but they tend to still b open from a 1/2 hour to an hour after "closing". Couldn't ask for better service than that!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Worst postal service experience ever. Service depends on whether he knows you or not. I got scolded for asking for a priority mail envelope.  Customers may pay for things that they would not be paying for in other post offices.< /text>

Don't go here for $.50 cents they lost my business and other people's that I know forever. Can i put 0 zero stars? First you walk in the place and it is a complete wreck, dirty, messy, looks like it has never been dusted or cleaned place is a dump. The people working here or are the owners are a couple named peter and dee allen they look at you with somber frowns on there faces right when they greet you.. You can totally tell she looks edgy, moody, and miserable. So does her creeper husband anyways they told me I had too pay for tape for my package which i found out was a new policy change and when I complained  about it they told me too leave.I ended up going too the real postal service center in boyle heights. This one on 2nd street   is a franchise based place along with the one on spring street. I would rather drive an extra 1 mile then deal with these type of horrible people. At boyle heights they are extremely friendly, smile say hi when they greet you and  just real nice older ladies too deal with. I recommend going there instead of either of these side show places for better customer service and over all better facility.</review>

(Translated by Google) The Japanese-speaking staff are from the mobile phone department,
I can't expect help with the mail.
Letter stamps are worth buying in bulk,
If you want to make a parcel, it's cheaper at home via the USPS website.

(Original)
日本語対応スタッフは携帯電話部門の人なので、
郵便の手伝いは期待できません。
手紙用の切手はまとめ買いする価値がありますが、
小包を作るなら自宅でUSPSのWebsite経由が割安。</Text>

Some of the best Tacos and Burritos you can find in Merced.  They mainly are a small shop and bakery, you owe it to yourself to try this place once if you want great mexican food in Merced.<//Text>

They have a security guard working and that made me feel safe and my personal property protected. He even helped my mother out of the car. Imagine how much tax money we could save if more local businesses adopted this model.< /text>

I rarely give a full five stars. I often want to give four and a half or three and three quarters stars but this place deserves five. They are exactly what they say they are, a Panaderia.

Yes, they have other Foods, they have delicious hot foods made right there for you as well, ice cream, other market sundries you might need for your food especially if you cook latin-style periodically.

But today I went there for lots of pan, Mexican sweet breads. The lady was really sweet, we spoke in Spanish, the other girls that have helped me there also really awesome.

I've never actually sat down to eat there. I'm usually in a hurry, but you can't beat great Mexican sweetbreads and the price is amazing! Go there. You won't be disappointed. If you want fancy-schmancy go somewhere else. If you want the real deal go here.<//text>

Great rice pudding and pastries! They don't always have the rice pudding, and I'd suggest coming earlier to get fresher bread. The concha + pasteles (birthday cake?) are good, and some of the cream-filled ones are good too!</text>

This is the best bakery in Merced, Mexican or otherwise. It's not easy to find, they could probably do with a new sign but they are always busy so I guess they don't need it. The baked goods are awesome. I also like the hot food that I have tried so far. The tamales have a perfect meat:masa ratio and everything always tastes fresh which is always a good thing. There's also a little ice cream shop on one side of the store. From outside you wouldn't even know it was a bakery if not for the smell of fresh baked goodness you can smell from a distance. I am sure that those bigger mercado type stores have their benefits but I know where to go to get quality and taste. The prices are even better too!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went with my daughter to eat at this place. I regretted seeing the. That she attended us very credulous and from Malaga. Carnitas Latorta that I asked for the tough meat. And well buttery. And the customer service is terrible, but the worst, but not all of those who work there are like that, some are very friendly, but to get it better, I'm not going back to that store. 9-17-18 east. Day I went to the owners of the store, pretend well, who they put to tend to people because this woman just twisted her face and even my girl was treated badly, it was like 4pm

(Original)
Ayer fui con mi hija a comer a este lugar. Me arrepenti de aver ido la. Que nos atendio muy creida y de malaga. Latorta de carnitas que pedi malisima la carne dura. Y bien mantecosa. Y la atencion al cliente pesima pero de lo peor pero no todas las que trabajan ahi son asi ai algunas muy amables pero para atinarle yo mejor ya no buelvo a esa tienda. 9-17-18 este.

<Review>Really enjoyed our lunch here. The inside atmosphere was very pleasing. The wait staff were attentive and friendly. I had the grilled shrimp over spinach salad. It was delicious even while I was eyeing the salmon salads my coworkers ordered. Another co-worker ordered the cheeseburger which he thoroughly enjoyed. Pricing was more than fair given the enormous quantities of food. Would love to go back when I visit San Jose again.< /Review>< user>

I ordered twice from them as room service while staying in the Sonesta.  I had the spinach, bacon, and egg salad from them. It tasted like it was prepared two days prior and then put into the fridge or something and the bacon was all burned and crispy with no flavor whatsoever.  The angry orchard from the bottle was the only thing decent about the meal. No joke. Then I decided to give them a try again for breakfast, but for the price, I think you are better of spending your money elsewhere. The coffee was not that good either.<//Review>

I had a very pleasant experience here this morning. The food was great, the coffee was great, but the icing on the "Pancakes" was Zapata and Eileeni (hope I spelled that right) they were so friendly and personable. My friend and I sat at a table that was in dedication to a customer who had been a regular for 20 years. I can see why. Looking forward to coming back again very soon!<//Review>

It's a staple if you stay at Sonesta. Love the tuna tartare. On the downside, closes too early (if closed, go to Sheraton across the street). Also not all the advertised wines are actually available.</Text>

Good place to get a couple of drinks after your work day conference. Around $7 or 8 per drink. Closes early depending on customer level. Overall nice place.</Text>

<Review>Good shoes to buy there i bought a pair of nmd ‘s and i love them they ordered them for me and gave me an option to pay half so i did and then paid the rest when they arrived and i havent stopped wearing them, i only found out about that store because of my friends and i went for the first time and dropped $300 on clothing and shoes and they gave me 20% off like wow thats awesome so im saving some money on what i spent so i very highly recommend going so you can go christmas shopping for your friends and family because their are some really good prices that other places cant beat also the workers are the best they are so chill they will help you with anything you need just ask and they will more than likely help you out! :D<//Review><Time>1545627659068</Time></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Came in to buy some gifts for my husbands birthday and I know how much he loves shoes so I wanted to see their selection. As I walked in I was not greeted, they were just talking amongst themselves, one of the guys was on their phone doing who knows what. Sadly only one guy was actually doing his job. No one asked me if I needed help with anything. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anything for my husband since I didn’t have a second opinion on some shoes I was looking at so I went to the mall instead. Customer service was just horrible and I’m never shopping here again.< /text>< Pics>

poor customer service. I felt all eyes were on me. the dude was a little too friendly asking me 21 questions, very distracting worse than a car salesmen.
shoes were on clearance they were uncomfortable and the other pair was alright but was a display shoe so it wasn't like getting a brand new shoe it was the opposite. kind of smells a little to be honest. no point in speaking with the GM</review>

Great store for most sporting needs near the area. Also has lost shoes Jordan retro's, kyries, nmd and much more. Although it's kinda pricy it's a good store<//Text>

This was my first time visiting Bonita Point Dental Arts, and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Everyone that serviced me today from the  receptionist/office manager (didn’t get her name) to the dental assistant, Cindy, to the hygienist, Rose, and of course Dr. Djie we’re all so welcoming, so friendly and kind, and so extremely professional. It’s always a little worrisome having to change medical professionals, especially when you’ve been with your favorites for years. But I think I’ve found my new favorites! Thank you, ladies! I look forward to seeing all of you again soon - - even  if I don’t really look forward to having more dental work done!<//text>

<review>My family has been coming to Bonita Point Dental Arts for almost 20 years. They have become like family. We enjoy the ease of dealing with our accounts, making appointments, and getting information about our dental health. During the last challenging 18 months, everyone has stepped up to make us feel safe when we visit. With today's technology, we can count on appointment reminders being sent via text as well as in-person calls.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80d94f93400c6635:0xc0c025e9599ed011< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I was referred to Bonita Point Dental by a family member. I was very nervous since I haven’t been to a dentist in a while.  The staff are very professional and made me feel at ease. Dr. Djie reviewed the work that needs to be done and I feel confident that  I’m in the right hands.  Thank you Dr.Djie and staff<//text>

First time patient and got the red carpet treatment by everyone. From the time I called to make an appointment,  I felt like I was speaking with someone in the dentist office. I was used to  calling into a call center where all they did was to make appointments. At Bonita Point,  I was able to secure a time slot with the dentist and  I did not have to wait 4 weeks like at the other place. At the dentist office, I notice that  the dentist and the staff  take genuine care for the patient and it’s a true personal attention. Not like a dental assembly line which I was used to be treated before. I regret not coming over to Bonita Point before. I am here for the long haul.< /Review>

First time here and I love it! They absolutely know what they were doing and they treat you so well. I like the team work and how they care about you, making sure you’re doing fine and if you need anything. They explain everything so well while working on your teeth. And the location is spot on! Great view to the Golf course.</Review>

<Text>I absolutely love the staff at Bonita Point Dental. They are the absolute best. We’ve recommended about a half dozen of our friends and family to them because their service is amazing.
I’ve never had a dentist take such care in making sure I’m comfortable and not in pain, but then to get their work done without using the anesthesia as an excuse to be sloppy or knick my gums or something.
Its the same for their hygienists, my teeth have never been as clean and more importantly I feel like they always have my health, above all else, at the top of their minds.

I couldn’t recommend them enough!!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80d94f93400c6635:0xc0c025e9599ed011<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

LOVE LOVE LOVE Bonita Point Dental. I’ve been with them for about 20 years now. They are great!! My  current dentist is Dr. G. She is so personable and very knowledgeable. Also, I have not ran into a hygienist I haven’t liked. Lordis at the front desk is great. She is so sweet and attentive. She has been working with Bonita Point for a very long time so she is very knowledgeable as well and very good at her job. The view at this location is great too. I wouldn’t trust anyone else with my teeth.<//review>

Service is excellent, quality & personal according to your needs. Everyone’s professional, kind, accommodating & always willing to help especially Lou in the front desk. I’ve known her since I started my dental care with them. She’s very knowledgeable of what she does. Grace is the best dental hygienist I always have. She takes care of your dental needs so well. And Dr. G is an awesome smart dentist... she renders excellent care with much patience to listen & explain things you need to hear. As long as they’re around, we have no plan of going to another dental provider.<//Text><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d94f93400c6635:0xc0c025e9599ed011< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>5</rate><Name>Naty Marquez</Name>< user>

My former dentist,  who retired after 50 years, Dr. Au referred me to D. D. S. Lily Djie at Bonita Point Dental Arts. Dr. Au a stated, I would be in good hands. Immediately after entering the dental office, I was immediately greeted in a friendly welcoming tone by Hygenist Rose. Shortly thereafter I was taken to the dental room for X-Rays. The Dental Assistant Cindy also greeted me in the same manner as Rose, who explained the purpose of the X-Rays. The process was quickly done, each set of the photos taken of my teeth, was displayed on a screen to ensure the photo was taken correctly. Next, I  was seen by the Hygenist Rose, who also explained the process, as she cleaned my teeth she frequently checked on how I was feeling.
Then I was seen by D. D. S. Djie, who also displayed the friendly manner as her employees. She explained in a simple terms the condition of my teeth,  and she did not show signs of being in a hurry and took her time with me.

In closing I want to mention the equipment used are modern and the staff mannerisms are outstanding. If you are hesitant in seeing a dentist, your fears will be toned down after your visit to D.D.S. Lily Djie.<//review>

<text>I've seen several dentists throughout the years around San Diego and Bonita dental is by far the absolute BEST dental Office I've ever been to! Dr. Pascua and his team are awesome! From the front office to the dental hygienist to the dental assistants, this staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Last week was my first dental cleaning here and this week I had a cavity filled by Dr. Pascua. Both visits were great and I felt no discomfort whatsoever. I didn't even feel the pinch of the shot to numb my gums prior to dental work! Dr. Pascua took his time to apply the numbing cream and allowed sufficient time to numb area prior to giving the shot. It clearly shows that this staff takes pride in their service they provide. They definitely earned their top 5 star ratings! Dr Pascua and his team has earned a client for as long as they practice dentistry :)< /text>< Pics>

I had an excellent visit at Bonita Point Dental! The staff were super friendly and welcoming. The facility was extremely clean, hygienic and CDC COVID-19 compliant. I did teeth cleaning and my hygienist did an extremely amazing job! I’m more than satisfied. I wasn’t pressured to buy any of their products and forced me to do any unnecessary dental work—I appreciate that a lot. I left my other dentist because of these exact reasons. I plan to visit again for the next cleaning!</Review>

I had the best experience. The staff and the dentist are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They make sure you feel comfortable. I came in for a emergency visit for a broken tooth. They took care of my situation right away.  I'm so glad I found a place with trusted people which is very important to me. Many years looking,  I found my dentist.<//text>

< review>
Had me as soon as I opened the door. Very nice , clean, organized and Covid prepared. From the front desk  to dental assistant, hygienist and Dr.  All were very courteous , efficient and professional thru the entire process. First time patient and would definitely recommended to patients looking for a dentist.
Second visit was just as satisfying and impressive as the first. Something  important came up and they still attended me about half hour past my appointment time. Lourdes in front desk made that happen and she also attempted to help  me with an issue at the specialist  but office was closed. Excelent treatment with very good chair manners by dentist and hygienist. Cant wait for next appointment !<//review>

My first experience at Bonita Point Dental was amazing. I went in expecting the usual pokes and pain that come along with dental cleaning. However, I was shocked to find out how gentle the cleaning went. I felt like I was being treated like an ancient fossil, the whole process was painless! I enjoyed the employees as well. Everyone was happy, kind, and taking all the safety precautions necessary.<//text>

<review>Went in for a chipped tooth (yeah... fun right). I was very concerned with the virus and all so I reached out to a well respected orthodontist(my daughter has braces)  and asked for a referral for a dental office. Bonita Point Dental Arts came highly recommended. They took all necessary measures to make the office safe! I had the work done same day. Went home and felt a little pain after the numbness went away. I contacted the office after hours to let them know & was seen the very next morning!! Very happy to call this my new dental office!</review>< pictures>

Can’t say enough good things about this dental office. The staff was not only very welcoming, but from start to finish they made the whole process so smooth. Setting up an appointment was really easy, and they were able to accommodate my whole family and I (including two young kids) into one time slot, which was convenient for us. Naturally, my kids were antsy about getting their teeth checked, but by the middle of the visit they were having so much fun with the staff that any fears they had subsided. Dr. Pascua really took his time with each one of us and was very thorough about the dental plan we needed, but was never pushy or aggressive about it - which sadly a lot of dentists get nowadays. Aside from the staff, the office was really clean and spacious, kid friendly, and had great, calming views of the nearby park/golf course while you get your teeth worked on! I definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a new, trustworthy, and caring dentist!< /Text>

This practice is just filled with good women. Rose did my cleaning today, very very gentle and thorough. Everything always runs on time there, they plan their schedules well. I appreciate the high level of caring for my dental health. I have been with this practice for years, and their front desk person Lourdes is the anchor. She chases me down when I don’t come in on schedule, which keeps me healthy.<//Review>

<Review>They treat you with kindness and respect.  Front desk is very helpful answered all my questions. They set my next appointment fast and was able to make payments. I arrived for my appointment and didn't have to wait. The dentist explained  the procedure and listen to my concerns.  I like the facility clean and love the view of the golf club. Everyone is very polite. Hygienist Grace, was so careful  cleaning my teeth and recommended a special package for washing  my teeth.  Checked Costco  for price comparison. It was more expensive at Costco. Thank you Bonita Point Dentist for making my life stress free.< /Review><user_id>117626347273850940636<//user_id><rate>5< /rate><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80d94f93400c6635:0xc0c025e9599ed011</gmap_id>< Pics>

<Date>1594234539697</Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Best dental experience. Staff are very professional and the facility is always clean and organize. I’ve been coming here a handful of times and they’ve always been on time as far as sitting me and starting the work right away.  Zero wait time for scheduled appointment and they work so efficiently that I leave fairly fast after arriving. That’s not to say that the work is not thorough because they do a great job. Dr Pascua has worked on two of my very old silver fillings and I have had zero issues. Dr Pascua got very gentle hands and you won’t feel any pain even when he applies anesthesia through injection. I live over 50
miles from this clinic but it’s worth the drive and I’m a customer life.

If you’re on a fence about finding a new dentist then try this clinic and you will find yourself actually enjoying a visit to the dentist. It really is a hidden gem. Superb customer service thanks to Dr Pascua and all the staff of Bonita Point Dental Arts.< /Text>< Pics>

Lourdes Is absolutely the best she works with our schedule  seamlessly and answers any questions right away.  Dr. Pascua is extremely experienced, he gets work done super fast with no pain. Would highly recommend if I could  give a 100 stars I would. Keep up the great work guys!</Review>

<Review>A very pleasant experience with my dental visit. I was greeted by the kind front desk staff, the clinic was very clean and open, with large windows over-looking the golf course. My dental assistant was very informative and made me feel comfortable since it was my first visit with this office. I met with Dr. Pascua who took time to address any concerns I had. He was considerate with my pain level and took the time to do the work carefully making sure my overall experience went well. I highly recommend coming to see Dr. Pascua and his team, as I felt my appointment was comprehensive knowing nothing was missed.

Five-star family dental office! They are honest, professional and friendly. Their awesome manager, Lourdes made my initial visit very pleasant from the time I walked in the door.

I have been with Bonita Point Dental Arts for 10 years now. It’s very easy to make appointments; staff are always pleasant, from the front to the back office.
My hygienist, Grace, is always so thorough and caring.
Dr Djie listens to my concerns & has best recommendations. Just completed my dental implant. Dr Djie is very detailed, gentle & fast.
My family also gets their dental care here.</text>

Can’t say enough good things about this dental office. The staff was not only very welcoming, but from start to finish they made the whole process so smooth. Setting up an appointment was really easy, and they were able to accommodate my whole family and I (including two young kids) into one time slot, which was convenient for us. Naturally, my kids were antsy about getting their teeth checked, but by the middle of the visit they were having so much fun with the staff that any fears they had subsided. Dr. Pascua really took his time with each one of us and was very thorough about the dental plan we needed, but was never pushy or aggressive about it - which sadly a lot of dentists get nowadays. Aside from the staff, the office was really clean and spacious, kid friendly, and had great, calming views of the nearby park/golf course while you get your teeth worked on! I definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a new, trustworthy, and caring dentist!<//Text>

The staff who polished my teeth was horrible. She was busy talking to others and didn’t care about what she was doing.  That was only thing she worked on me. Terrible, very terrible.< /review>

<review>Had a great experience today on my first dental appt. Front desk reception was very welcoming...thanks Lourdes!  Dr Pascua explained what the process would be for this visit ..xrays taken by Cindy and Dr Pascua read results to inform me of what dental treatment he would recommend for next visit; teeth cleaned and polished by their Hygienist Rose. Office was very clean bright and airy ! Definitely would come back again . Thanks everyone! ❤️<//review>< pics>

<Text>This was my first time visiting Bonita Point Dental Arts, and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Everyone that serviced me today from the  receptionist/office manager (didn’t get her name) to the dental assistant, Cindy, to the hygienist, Rose, and of course Dr. Djie we’re all so welcoming, so friendly and kind, and so extremely professional. It’s always a little worrisome having to change medical professionals, especially when you’ve been with your favorites for years. But I think I’ve found my new favorites! Thank you, ladies! I look forward to seeing all of you again soon - - even  if I don’t really look forward to having more dental work done!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

You always exceed even my highest expectations with your work. The entire staff is always wonderfully supportive and encouraging. The care you provided me with was phenomenal once again. You do magnificent work through your dental practice, and I thank you.  Thank you for always taking my concerns into consideration and for always being happy to answer my questions. You and your staff provide the absolute best of care, and that is an incredible and awe-inspiring accomplishment. I want to thank you for your incredible work and compliment you on your skills and professionalism. You are the most helpful and competent dentist I have ever met. Thank you for making everything so care-free and straightforward.<//Text>

<response>None< /response><text>My family has been coming to Bonita Point Dental Arts for almost 20 years. They have become like family. We enjoy the ease of dealing with our accounts, making appointments, and getting information about our dental health. During the last challenging 18 months, everyone has stepped up to make us feel safe when we visit. With today's technology, we can count on appointment reminders being sent via text as well as in-person calls.<//text><rate>5< /rate>< gmap_id>

First time patient and got the red carpet treatment by everyone. From the time I called to make an appointment,  I felt like I was speaking with someone in the dentist office. I was used to  calling into a call center where all they did was to make appointments. At Bonita Point,  I was able to secure a time slot with the dentist and  I did not have to wait 4 weeks like at the other place. At the dentist office, I notice that  the dentist and the staff  take genuine care for the patient and it’s a true personal attention. Not like a dental assembly line which I was used to be treated before. I regret not coming over to Bonita Point before. I am here for the long haul.<//text>

First time here and I love it! They absolutely know what they were doing and they treat you so well. I like the team work and how they care about you, making sure you’re doing fine and if you need anything. They explain everything so well while working on your teeth. And the location is spot on! Great view to the Golf course.<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><text>I absolutely love the staff at Bonita Point Dental. They are the absolute best. We’ve recommended about a half dozen of our friends and family to them because their service is amazing.
I’ve never had a dentist take such care in making sure I’m comfortable and not in pain, but then to get their work done without using the anesthesia as an excuse to be sloppy or knick my gums or something.
Its the same for their hygienists, my teeth have never been as clean and more importantly I feel like they always have my health, above all else, at the top of their minds.

I couldn’t recommend them enough!!</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

LOVE LOVE LOVE Bonita Point Dental. I’ve been with them for about 20 years now. They are great!! My  current dentist is Dr. G. She is so personable and very knowledgeable. Also, I have not ran into a hygienist I haven’t liked. Lordis at the front desk is great. She is so sweet and attentive. She has been working with Bonita Point for a very long time so she is very knowledgeable as well and very good at her job. The view at this location is great too. I wouldn’t trust anyone else with my teeth.<//Review>

Thankful, I’ve been  with Bonita Point Dental for almost 25 years, so with my husband. I can’t recall any unpleasant experience with this dental provider. Service is excellent, quality & personal according to your needs. Everyone’s professional, kind, accommodating & always willing to help especially Lou in the front desk. I’ve known her since I started my dental care with them. She’s very knowledgeable of what she does. Grace is the best dental hygienist I always have. She takes care of your dental needs so well. And Dr. G is an awesome smart dentist... she renders excellent care with much patience to listen & explain things you need to hear. As long as they’re around, we have no plan of going to another dental provider.<//review>

<text>My former dentist,  who retired after 50 years, Dr. Au referred me to D. D. S. Lily Djie at Bonita Point Dental Arts. Dr. Au a stated, I would be in good hands. Immediately after entering the dental office, I was immediately greeted in a friendly welcoming tone by Hygenist Rose. Shortly thereafter I was taken to the dental room for X-Rays. The Dental Assistant Cindy also greeted me in the same manner as Rose, who explained the purpose of the X-Rays. The process was quickly done, each set of the photos taken of my teeth, was displayed on a screen to ensure the photo was taken correctly. Next, I  was seen by the Hygenist Rose, who also explained the process, as she cleaned my teeth she frequently checked on how I was feeling.
Then I was seen by D. D. S. Djie, who also displayed the friendly manner as her employees. She explained in a simple terms the condition of my teeth,  and she did not show signs of being in a hurry and took her time with me.

In closing I want to mention the equipment used are modern and the staff mannerisms are outstanding. If you are hesitant in seeing a dentist, your fears will be toned down after your visit to D.D.S. Lily Djie.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>I've seen several dentists throughout the years around San Diego and Bonita dental is by far the absolute BEST dental Office I've ever been to! Dr. Pascua and his team are awesome! From the front office to the dental hygienist to the dental assistants, this staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Last week was my first dental cleaning here and this week I had a cavity filled by Dr. Pascua. Both visits were great and I felt no discomfort whatsoever. I didn't even feel the pinch of the shot to numb my gums prior to dental work! Dr. Pascua took his time to apply the numbing cream and allowed sufficient time to numb area prior to giving the shot. It clearly shows that this staff takes pride in their service they provide. They definitely earned their top 5 star ratings! Dr Pascua and his team has earned a client for as long as they practice dentistry :)<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Had a cleaning with Marinella today. She is a consummate professional. She is polite, gentle and courteous. Dr. Pascua as always is a true professional with a wonderful manner. Lourdes has a very welcoming and caring personality. She is always ready to provide any assistance she can to make one’s visit comfortable and worry free.</review>

<Review>I had an excellent visit at Bonita Point Dental! The staff were super friendly and welcoming. The facility was extremely clean, hygienic and CDC COVID-19 compliant. I did teeth cleaning and my hygienist did an extremely amazing job! I’m more than satisfied. I wasn’t pressured to buy any of their products and forced me to do any unnecessary dental work—I appreciate that a lot. I left my other dentist because of these exact reasons. I plan to visit again for the next cleaning!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I had the best experience. The staff and the dentist are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They make sure you feel comfortable. I came in for a emergency visit for a broken tooth. They took care of my situation right away.  I'm so glad I found a place with trusted people which is very important to me. Many years looking,  I found my dentist.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Had me as soon as I opened the door. Very nice , clean, organized and Covid prepared. From the front desk  to dental assistant, hygienist and Dr.  All were very courteous , efficient and professional thru the entire process. First time patient and would definitely recommended to patients looking for a dentist.
Second visit was just as satisfying and impressive as the first. Something  important came up and they still attended me about half hour past my appointment time. Lourdes in front desk made that happen and she also attempted to help  me with an issue at the specialist  but office was closed. Excelent treatment with very good chair manners by dentist and hygienist. Cant wait for next appointment !< /Review>< pics>

My first experience at Bonita Point Dental was amazing. I went in expecting the usual pokes and pain that come along with dental cleaning. However, I was shocked to find out how gentle the cleaning went. I felt like I was being treated like an ancient fossil, the whole process was painless! I enjoyed the employees as well. Everyone was happy, kind, and taking all the safety precautions necessary.< /Text>

Went in for a chipped tooth (yeah... fun right). I was very concerned with the virus and all so I reached out to a well respected orthodontist(my daughter has braces)  and asked for a referral for a dental office. Bonita Point Dental Arts came highly recommended. They took all necessary measures to make the office safe! I had the work done same day. Went home and felt a little pain after the numbness went away. I contacted the office after hours to let them know & was seen the very next morning!! Very happy to call this my new dental office!<//Text>

Can’t say enough good things about this dental office. The staff was not only very welcoming, but from start to finish they made the whole process so smooth. Setting up an appointment was really easy, and they were able to accommodate my whole family and I (including two young kids) into one time slot, which was convenient for us. Naturally, my kids were antsy about getting their teeth checked, but by the middle of the visit they were having so much fun with the staff that any fears they had subsided. Dr. Pascua really took his time with each one of us and was very thorough about the dental plan we needed, but was never pushy or aggressive about it - which sadly a lot of dentists get nowadays. Aside from the staff, the office was really clean and spacious, kid friendly, and had great, calming views of the nearby park/golf course while you get your teeth worked on! I definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a new, trustworthy, and caring dentist!<//Text>

Doctor G is awesome, very gentle and detail oriented.
Both the wife and I are very thankful for her care.
And of course Lourdes is the best.

They treat you with kindness and respect.  Front desk is very helpful answered all my questions. They set my next appointment fast and was able to make payments. I arrived for my appointment and didn't have to wait. The dentist explained  the procedure and listen to my concerns.  I like the facility clean and love the view of the golf club. Everyone is very polite. Hygienist Grace, was so careful  cleaning my teeth and recommended a special package for washing  my teeth.  Checked Costco  for price comparison. It was more expensive at Costco. Thank you Bonita Point Dentist for making my life stress free.</Review>

<text>Best dental experience. Staff are very professional and the facility is always clean and organize. I’ve been coming here a handful of times and they’ve always been on time as far as sitting me and starting the work right away.  Zero wait time for scheduled appointment and they work so efficiently that I leave fairly fast after arriving. That’s not to say that the work is not thorough because they do a great job. Dr Pascua has worked on two of my very old silver fillings and I have had zero issues. Dr Pascua got very gentle hands and you won’t feel any pain even when he applies anesthesia through injection. I live over 50
miles from this clinic but it’s worth the drive and I’m a customer life.

If you’re on a fence about finding a new dentist then try this clinic and you will find yourself actually enjoying a visit to the dentist. It really is a hidden gem. Superb customer service thanks to Dr Pascua and all the staff of Bonita Point Dental Arts.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I was greeted by the kind front desk staff, the clinic was very clean and open, with large windows over-looking the golf course. My dental assistant was very informative and made me feel comfortable since it was my first visit with this office. I met with Dr. Pascua who took time to address any concerns I had. He was considerate with my pain level and took the time to do the work carefully making sure my overall experience went well. I highly recommend coming to see Dr. Pascua and his team, as I felt my appointment was comprehensive knowing nothing was missed.

< Review>
I have been with Bonita Point Dental Arts for 10 years now. It’s very easy to make appointments; staff are always pleasant, from the front to the back office.
My hygienist, Grace, is always so thorough and caring.
Dr Djie listens to my concerns & has best recommendations. Just completed my dental implant. Dr Djie is very detailed, gentle & fast.
My family also gets their dental care here.<//Review>

<Time>1563515951945< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>Can’t say enough good things about this dental office. The staff was not only very welcoming, but from start to finish they made the whole process so smooth. Setting up an appointment was really easy, and they were able to accommodate my whole family and I (including two young kids) into one time slot, which was convenient for us. Naturally, my kids were antsy about getting their teeth checked, but by the middle of the visit they were having so much fun with the staff that any fears they had subsided. Dr. Pascua really took his time with each one of us and was very thorough about the dental plan we needed, but was never pushy or aggressive about it - which sadly a lot of dentists get nowadays. Aside from the staff, the office was really clean and spacious, kid friendly, and had great, calming views of the nearby park/golf course while you get your teeth worked on! I definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a new, trustworthy, and caring dentist!<//text>< pictures>

In the past years,  I hop from dentist to another dentist every two years.. I finally got stability at this dental office. Its close to home and staff are welcoming and friendly. Dr. Pascua and Dr. Gee are both accommodating.  I can walk in to the office in time of emergency. Lourdes, the office manager is terrific with her paper work management.  I never have issue with calling my insurance and THats a plus!!!!!  I highly recommend this dental clinic for their efficient, effectiveness and professional work.< /text>

Everyone from the office manager to the dentist are supper helpful to acomódate your needs.
The cleaning done by Grace was excellent and painless.
Dr Lilyn Djie service on two of my teeth repairs was above expectations very accommodating and supper fast to do a great cosmetic job. Very happy with the overall service...</Review>

Had a great experience today on my first dental appt. Front desk reception was very welcoming...thanks Lourdes!  Dr Pascua explained what the process would be for this visit ..xrays taken by Cindy and Dr Pascua read results to inform me of what dental treatment he would recommend for next visit; teeth cleaned and polished by their Hygienist Rose. Office was very clean bright and airy ! Definitely would come back again . Thanks everyone! ❤️< /Text>
