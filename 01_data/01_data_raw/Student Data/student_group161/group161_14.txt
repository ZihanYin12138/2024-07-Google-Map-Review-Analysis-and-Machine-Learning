The worst emergency department ever!!!! What type of doctor allow a patient to leave the ER with a temperature of 103.1???? Dr. Andrew Williamson cared less about my husband on Sunday morning. My husband stated that Dr. Williamson had his backpack on as if he was leaving for the night which tells it all. He didn’t care about him! The only thing he told my husband is difference between bacteria and virus. No medication was given nor an explanation of why he has a fever. I pray that God forgive him for turning his back on someone who was in need of his care and skills. Sometimes I ask myself why are some people are even doctors because some just don’t care about people. It is more about the money which is sad.< /Text>

<review>Great staff. They will take good care of you. The only issue I had was the lack of parking even with a huge parking garage, I had the drive all five floors three times to find. Parking spot. Then they charged me $15.00 to visit my father after the hospital will make thousands of dollars of his surgery.< /review><user>100831161468951711321<//user>< resp>

<review>My fiancé rushed his mom to this ER yesterday. She was was seizing and he needed help getting her out of the car. She needed immediate help. He went inside and there was barely anyone there. He was yelling for someone to help him and the security guard acted like he could care less to call someone. A patient in the waiting room pointed him to the front desk. The front desk woman said it’s going to be a minute, she didn’t even call anyone. This is her home hospital? What a joke. He just left and drive to Scripps Memorial and they INSTANTLY treated it as an emergency the front desk woman jumped up too. She was seen right away, they actually cared. They are disgusted with how Sharp treated the situation considering how critical of a state she is in is much worse than we thought. SHAME on you Sharp, SHAME!!</review>< Pics>

<review>Took a friend to emergency for chest pain , long wait of 3hrs. Facility is not clean, spilled food and things all over the place in wait area and first triage room. Got sick just waiting there.

Update: after the 3hr wait we were admitted in the room. The on-duty doctor and nurses were exceptional. Updating to 3 stars. However the waiting area needs to be brighter and clean.<//review><Rate>3< /Rate>< time>

I want to give a special thanks to Tae, Anabelle, and Lizett on the 6th floor. They are amazing, astonishing, super nice ladies, they definitely deserve to be more than RN’s. I definitely recommend this hospital which is way better than scripps or UCSD. Great jobs overall but Lino L on the first floor definitely need to work on his customer service. He asked me to put the socks on the patients to put her stuff on the bed so he can transport her which I do not like.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This hospital is staffed by friendly and knowledgeable staff. I feel like I get amazing care any time I need to go to this hospital, or any Sharp facility. I was here for 6 days and the care I received was great. I felt safe knowing my care was in good hands. I had the same doctor and nurses every day, which was nice because I didn't need to tell them why I was there 5 million times. I was never not told what was going on and was always very well informed. The cleaning staff kept my room tidy, and the CNA's offered to change my bedding daily.</review><gmapID>0x80d9555f40070df1:0x7c4c50bfdc73c9f5< /gmapID>< Response>

I went in for a kidney stone in a lot of pain and already had confirmation of the source from the Urgent Care that had sent me...

Still they insisted on doing blood work and a scan despite my having no insurance.

In the end, I was told the problem would pass and was given some muscle relaxers and 5 percocet.

THEY CHARGED ME $12,000 FOR THIS< /Text>

I really hate to leave a review like this because I really do love this hospital and it has amazing staff but my most recent visit under the care of Dr. Zach Shinar was not pleasant at all
I came to the hospital for very uncomfortable and painful chest pain, I felt like I was not properly examined the doctor didn't even listen to my lungs and just assumed I had a blood clot. I asked for pain meds and literally had to wait 3 whole hours to just receive two tabs of Tylenol,  it was truly sad I felt like I had to beg the nurses for medication to take care of the horrible pain I was in. After they explained that my ct scan wasn't done correctly they just sent me home with no explanation of what was wrong with me all they knew was that I didn't have a blood clot. I am thankful for the kind nurses, though I hope I do not end up in Dr. Shinar's care again<//text>

My wife was discharged with same symptoms experienced when arriving. During her 4 hour stay, no water or food was offered. Medical staff was unpleasant and did not communicate her care with her before informing her she was being discharged. No one informed her of the reason for discharge nor informed her labs had returned. Staff only offered to print the labs for her and only offered to get the physician after she was upset and complained after being told she was being discharged with no explanation of diagnoses. Primary care doctor called while she was in the ER, and recommended she be there, all while the ER staff was quickly to discharge. She was left outside of the ER when I arrived to pick her up, barely able to walk and still short of breath with chest tightness. Contacted ER to complain: ER manager Kara? informed me my wife was upset and refused to have labs reviewed, however no one offered to review them nor informed her the results were received prior to discharge. My own personal experience was much different with less symptoms and I’m starting to wonder if this has to do with the racial disparities in healthcare.<//text>

<text>I am beyond impressed with the care I have received since I switch hospital groups. I’ve been to the emergency room a couple of times, and both times my experience has been nothing short than amazing. My primary care physician is on top of my medical issues on a consistent basis. He even messages me and ensures we stay on track. Last week, I had my first operation through the Sharp healthcare system, and I can’t even begin to say how amazing the team has been. There were some minor complications (no fault of them, I have an allergy issue), but they have been on top of it daily. Calling me or messaging me everyday and if needed, ensuring I get in right away for an issue.  My surgeon did a beautiful job, and so far I’m so happy with the results. Sharp has been such a positive experience and I’m glad that I made the switch!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Just left a Hospital that does an awesome job; especially on their CoVId floor; I went in due to Kidney Fluid Overload & a lite case of ￼pneumonia; was admitted to the CoVId floor just until I had two negative test results ... The Staff were awesome & cared for the patients well-being.  I’m very impressed with this Hospital 🍀💚<//review>

I have been patient of this hospital for more than 25 years. I never put a review before. I filed a complain 8 years ago and I noticed the hospital services  has gotten worse. I just got discharged after Orthopedic surgery. I contacted the hospital several department and got horrible responses. No one ever responded or took action. Answering service staff are rude and just hangs up on me. They speak extremely fast and we can't understand a word they say. If you please slow down they immediately hangs up on you. Department's you are trying to reach always never pick up. You leave a message and never call you back.</review>

The room sofa turns into a bed so all things considered we had a pleasant time during our stay. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I went into sharps today for a cataract operation. The entire staff that I interacted with were courteous and competent. I was well taken care of at every step of the process. I highly recommend this surgical group (it was the outpatient surgical group)
Congratulations on your great service.

This is for the sleep lab at Sharp Memorial Hospital. My mother has been struggled with sleep apnea for a couple years now. Her primary care doctor has preferred her to Sharp Memorial Hospital because it was contracted to her insurance. My mom's insurance had approved this study to be conducted. When I call the sleep lab to make an appointment, a lady named Fiona refused to do it. She said she did not have any paperwork stating my mom needed this study. She said Sharp will loose its accreditation if she schedule this appointment. Who is this person? Why does she have the authority to ask my mom if she needed this lab study? This lady, Fiona had done so in a very condescending and uncaring tone during the entire conversation. Now my mom has to wait another 2 months to see a sleep specialist and have him resend all of this info back to Sharp. Meanwhile, my mom's condition is getting worse. Please stay away from this place. They don't know what they are doing. My Sharp experience is horrible, painful, and disgusting.<//review>

I have had the "pleasure" of visiting the ER three times and being admitted at Sharp Memorial overnight twice in the last 2 weeks.  My score is based on two criteria:
A) Staff - vast majority are caring professionals who are in tune with their basic mission of supporting patients in regaining their health and quality of life. 4.5 stars
B) Administration - lack of support for basics required to help their staff achieve the above mission.  Case in point - making the choice to allow heavy duty construction to operate in close proximity to patients from 4 AM UNTIL 11 PM !!!!  SERIOUSLY ?? A 5 hour sleep window for people who are hospitalized????  Who is running this circus?  < 1 star.
Hence my final score.< /review>

Excellent hospital! My mom went in to get her high blood pressure treated and the moment we walked in the door we were treated with respect and kindness. Once we checked into the ER my mom was taken back to triage by a super friendly nurse. Afterwards we got taken to our own room in the back of the ER. The facility was nice, clean and up-to-date. While my mom was being treated every staff person who visited was super friendly, nice and warm. Everyone was very attentive to my mom's needs and we were able to get in and out in half a day. Definitely recommend this hospital! It is our new go to hospital should the need ever arise again</Review>

Was charged $75 for getting vitals at E.R. and waiting 3 hours and not being seen by doctor.

Waiting area was a mess and there was feces on the floor of the bathroom.

Worst E.R. experience.

Came in to this hospital in horrible shape I have congestive heart failure
I have been to a few hospitals in my area unfortunately that don't have the expertise in this category so when I was in San Diego I decided to stop here for care
The emergency Room staff A+
The physicians and specialists and doctors the regimen that they had me on was top notch A+
But the political lazy nurses or very forgetful especially in mostly on the 7th floor North need retraining
You have one nurse there who unfortunately knows my daughter-in-law and it all ended up being downhill
Having muscle spasm and having your nurse walk out while you're an excruciating pain and screaming thank goodness for the X-ray Tech who was an angel who stayed behind help my hand and watch me and help me
I ax for a wheelchair I was ignored I sent my friend was watching over me to get a will cheer for me front desk nurse reports back she's independent get it herself
I was in disbelief but after reading what they wrote about me saying that I had my breast out and every time they went in a Room they could not record my urine with absolute lie an absolute imature of them
Even though they were acting lazy and forgetful I call myself trying to help them by taking a photo to record the amount of urine so that I can be April to your and again as they did not come in a Room much to do their jobs and I was left to do it for them
Little do they know I video recorded most of my stay there and most of what was said to me so that I can remember it unfortunately for them it will reveal their lies
I was really happy about my treatment at the doctor's help me with it was going to write a letter I thank you letter because I really appreciated it but after what I heard the nurses said to a pastor of mine

I'm really disappointed because I found out that my treatment was ended early because of them lying on me the whole time I was there the smiling in my face and thanking me for doing their jobs but lying behind my back
Saying that I was on cooperative and kept walking around excuse the hell out of me but I was told to walk for circulation purposes
I'm definitely seek an attorney
This is very sad because the doctors I feel did a great job for me
unfortunately you have nurses that you need to get rid of especially in that department in a charge nurse I am ashamed of her being so defensive instead of looking at the evidence
She was more concerned about what evidence I had then she was the way I was treated<//review>

Wow the Sharp in Kearny area. If i could give them a 10 I would. First thing the room were suites I'm talking so refreshing and private. And I have to say the entire staff on 7 west were on it top on the line i mean everybody including the food services team. Every expectation that I had was super superseded. They took such good care of me that when it was time for me to leave. I didn't want to go HaHaha. Well thanks so much to the entire crew at 7 West You are the best of the best. And yes the Sharp Experience at Kearny Mesa is 100% true. I well never go anywhere else.If I need to go to the hospital.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I went here after going to another ER that had a 3-4 hour wait. Sharp had me in the back within 15 minutes. Everyone was so helpful, clerical, nurses and the doctor man I can’t say enough about that man. Dr. J. P. Smithson was his name. At the worst moment of my life he was understanding and truly cared. After going to a primary before and not getting any help (which he couldn’t believe that I got pushed away from a MD) I was probably a nightmare to treat because I was so sick but he dealt with me and helped me as much as he could. Honestly I lost faith in almost all doctors who don’t treat and push you away when I’m need. Not this doctor. I wish I could have him as my primary I might actually go to the doctor more. Really I can not thank this man enough and I hope to see him again or talk to him and thank him and the nurses. He is a true doctor, a gift to humanity. I also want to thank Sharp and please Sharp if you read this pass along this message to the Dr and if you could put me in contact with him< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I think the emergency department needs to be more attentive. Whomever answers the phone will transfer calls while you are in mid sentence to another person who has no idea why you are calling them and cannot help you, and will also transfer your call. Its an exhausting cycle.  It took a lot of patience for me to have to explain myself to five people to figure out if my dad was brought in by ambulance to this hospital. I'm not sure why I had to waste that much time.</Review>

<review>Sharp's Hospital is the best. They have taken excellent category of my elderly Mother. She has been in this Hospital several times and each time they have a terrific staff. I don't live in California and worry about her. She is stubborn and wants to stay in San Diego but when I know she's at Sharp's Hospital I know she's in good hands. Thank you for taking care of my loved one.<//review>< pictures>

I went there for a accident and stayed 4 days. I will not complain for the service who was one of the best I received in my life.
BUT, I definitely think there’s a big billing issue. I do have a insurance who will cover all the expenses but I just received the bill and the hospital is charging 20k a day for a Intermediate care room (no services, just the room) !!!! It’s absurd! I wouldn’t car because this is the insurance problem but I do think it’s abusive. I think they will go trough legal issue. Last time I checked on their website the price was much lower. The staff I spoke to by phone refused to tell me what was the usual daily price and only answered me “don’t worry this is an insurance matter now”.
It wasn’t even intensive care so I’m sorry but 20k/day they will have to explain...</text>

There are some major communications issues within this complex.  If you have an emergency on Friday evening and are told to come back Saturday, be prepared to wait forever and get very little accomplished because one department won't have access to your x-rays, etc. because that other department isn't open on weekends.  Oh, and forget about getting a cast on a weekend, too.  I only give this 3 stars because the staff is competent but hindered.  The facilities are clean, bright and calming and everyone we came in contact with was friendly.  We actually got to see an MD (Not an RN, NP, etc.), which is becoming increasingly difficult.  One huge plus is that we were referred and got approval almost instantly and were seen right away.< /text>

I suffered a concussion when I fell off of my bicycle. I do not know recall my fall as I was unconscious when I hit my head, but when I woke up in an ambulance, I had lots of bruises and abrasion on my body. They decided to take me to Sharp Memorial Hospital. This was around 17:00 on January 22nd, 2018.
The review here is for the staff that took care of me at the ER. I am very thankful for the doctor (I do not remember him, but it was an older male) that examined me. And I am very grateful and thankful to the nurse (Jackie) that took care of me. She treated every of my wounds and patched me up. I just wanted to say thank you so much for taking care of me. Their customer service is marvelous. They go out of their way to care for you when you come in. Everyone here is nice and genuine. I am glad that my injury is not serious.
They are also nice to tell you what happened to you as in explaining the injury and answering all your questions. The nurse that assisted me with everything was kind and professional.
Anyways, it will be a little while before I recover from my fall, but I will rest up. Now as for the medical bill.....that will sting me which is part of life. I do know they are willing to work with me on that so it is a bit reassuring. But the service that you get here is outstanding. Thank you so much for treating me here.
Looks like it will be a little while before I will write another Yelp review as I am having a hard time enjoying food. Once I recover, (hopefully next month) I shall reward myself with good food and write more Yelp reviews.
NOTE: Although I give it a 5 stars, just keep in mind that most are genuinely nice. There are few that would have a bad day, but they will all help you if you are nice and polite. As a person that worked at a customer service job in the past, I can say that most people here will give a great customer service to you.</Text>

<Text>I live in East County and opted to come to Sharp, because the ER reviews were superior.   I am so glad that I did!   The ER staff was so kind, efficient and skilled.    I received excellent treatment.  I was admitted to the hospital, and I am still here, and I am getting better.  I hope to be discharged soon.     Given the circumstance, I could not have asked for better treatment and care.

<text>Recently I was in the ER and admitted to Sharp Memorial. This was my second time here at this hospital and I was greatly displeased from start to finish. I could not catch my breath and felt like I was drowning. The person who was working the front desk told my husband and I, very rudely might I add, that we "Had to wait and just stand right there, I'm busy." So here I am standing there barely holding on and couldn't even talk. Finally we are able to sit down and he began taking my vitals my another woman was taking my information. This man looks at me and says well your breathing is fine, it's 100%(which he says with a smirk). Yeah, my oxygen is at 100% because I am hyperventilating and trying to stay alive. I get back to a room and they start telling me I need to calm down. I understand that I need to calm down, but when you can catch your breath it's hard to be relaxed. How about trying to get my breathing under control first? They couldn't figure out what was going on, so they decided to admit me. The entire time I was admitted they tried doing the same treatments over and over. Even though these treatments did not work and often times made my heart rate go fast. Oh I forgot to mention, the week before I came here (after being sent from Urgent Care) for a high heart rate and breathing issues for which I was diagnosed with Bronchitis. They refused to give me antibiotics because the "the side affects just aren't worth it". They only gave me steroids, which obviously did not work. The two problems that made me ask for my own discharge was an unprofessional Nurse and Respiratory Therapist. The RT told me that everything that was going on (one was my heart rate jumping to 180 while resting) was all in my mind and that I was just having panic attacks. Really? I'm so glad that you can diagnosis me with an anxiety disorder when that's not even your profession. The next was when my Nurse came in and told me that there was no way I had asthma (which I have been diagnosed with for the past 12 years) because I don't wheeze, my lungs just tighten up. Hmmm.... that's funny considering there is some times that I wheeze and other times where I tighten up. After discussing this with the RT she said that wheezing is not necessarily a necessity for or the only indicator for Asthma. This whole time I was here they wanted to treat the symptoms, not the actual problem. I will now be following up with my Primary and having a referral to see a real specialist to figure out what's going on. The only reason why I am giving this hospital 1 star is because of the nurses that I had that were just phenomenal! Without those nurses I probably wouldn't be here today. So thank you to those ladies who kept me alive!< /text>< pics>

<review>Best hospital hands down. My whole family have been doctors or nurses at various hospitals. My wife is at sharp for the second time this year for surgery. I am sad that my company will now be switching to Kaiser.
For those complaining about cost, you can blame the insurance company’s and the sue happy people who have made medicine more expensive. If I know my life depends on it I trust Sharp more than any other hospital.</review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>108173549648152335374<//user_id>< pics>

Recently I was in the ER and admitted to Sharp Memorial. This was my second time here at this hospital and I was greatly displeased from start to finish. I could not catch my breath and felt like I was drowning. The person who was working the front desk told my husband and I, very rudely might I add, that we "Had to wait and just stand right there, I'm busy." So here I am standing there barely holding on and couldn't even talk. Finally we are able to sit down and he began taking my vitals my another woman was taking my information. This man looks at me and says well your breathing is fine, it's 100%(which he says with a smirk). Yeah, my oxygen is at 100% because I am hyperventilating and trying to stay alive. I get back to a room and they start telling me I need to calm down. I understand that I need to calm down, but when you can catch your breath it's hard to be relaxed. How about trying to get my breathing under control first? They couldn't figure out what was going on, so they decided to admit me. The entire time I was admitted they tried doing the same treatments over and over. Even though these treatments did not work and often times made my heart rate go fast. Oh I forgot to mention, the week before I came here (after being sent from Urgent Care) for a high heart rate and breathing issues for which I was diagnosed with Bronchitis. They refused to give me antibiotics because the "the side affects just aren't worth it". They only gave me steroids, which obviously did not work. The two problems that made me ask for my own discharge was an unprofessional Nurse and Respiratory Therapist. The RT told me that everything that was going on (one was my heart rate jumping to 180 while resting) was all in my mind and that I was just having panic attacks. Really? I'm so glad that you can diagnosis me with an anxiety disorder when that's not even your profession. The next was when my Nurse came in and told me that there was no way I had asthma (which I have been diagnosed with for the past 12 years) because I don't wheeze, my lungs just tighten up. Hmmm.... that's funny considering there is some times that I wheeze and other times where I tighten up. After discussing this with the RT she said that wheezing is not necessarily a necessity for or the only indicator for Asthma. This whole time I was here they wanted to treat the symptoms, not the actual problem. I will now be following up with my Primary and having a referral to see a real specialist to figure out what's going on. The only reason why I am giving this hospital 1 star is because of the nurses that I had that were just phenomenal! Without those nurses I probably wouldn't be here today. So thank you to those ladies who kept me alive!</Review>

I really liked Dr. Brewster and all of the other people involved.  I had a polyp in my nose removed.  They never quoted me a price.  I simply relied on internet message boards and doctor websites for cost estimates, which seemed reasonable.   However I was shocked to get a bill for $42,000.  This was more than my friend's hip replacement surgery, and 3-4 times what other medical groups estimate on healthcare estimate websites.  I'm scheduled for other procedures in 2019 but will be cancelling due to the major bills they are now charging me for the next
year.

Here's what's also disturbing.  During his assessment, Dr. Brewster diagnosed me with another disease but didn't bother to tell me.  He buried this in his notes, which I only discovered months after my surgery.  How ethical is it not to disclose a disease to a patient?<//Review>

Unfortunately I've been a patient at this hospital more often than I would have liked, however if you need to be in a hospital it would be very difficult to find a better one. Staff are extremely friendly, helpful knowledgeable and kind especially the nurses who work so hard but always with a smile and comforting words . The rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped. Parking is easier than most hospitals. Most procedures are carried out on site. The ER gets overwhelmed sometimes with lengthy waits, but most ER's seem to suffer from the same problem. Really there's nothing to complain about with this facility.</Text>

Mere words can not begin to describe the gratitude I have for the professional staff at this location.
My 66 yrs old mother started experiencing violent episodes of vomiting in combination with a acute case of vertigo when we  arrived at the ER and despite the expected chaos during the busy peak hours we were met and greeted promptly by their professional staff ASAP.
During our entire 6+ hours duration at the ER we were attended to from start to finish with nothing but professionalism with genuine care and compassion from each and every individual.
I can not thank them enough for all of their hard work and caring service we experienced during my mothers medical emergency.
The bar has certainly been set high for others to follow in the ER setting.
Thank you, sincerely.<//text>

<text>The customer service was great! I visited the Sharp Memorial Hospital but didn't receive a compete doctor checkup. The whole process was rushed. After waiting for more than 3 hours, I didn't receive the help or attention I needed. After a day later I wasn't feeling good so I called the Sharp Hospital customer service, the head nurse was very rude and did not help me. The head nurse did not put the slightest effort to understand how I was feeling or my concern and hung the phone on my face. The hospital is a place where you should receive medical help, I did not receive a full physical checkup, it was very rushed without any prescribed medication and I was immediately sent home.<//text>< Pics>

Since I was "head trauma" they took me back right away and continually checked on me.  The Doctors, CT techs, X-Ray techs, nurses, everyone was VERY sensitive, polite, friendly, compassionate, empathetic, and caring.

The plain-and-simple approach the Doctor took was much appreciated.  His explanations really simplified my medications, my after-care, and most important parts of follow-up, etc.

I speak highly of this institution since the accident (about a week prior to this review) and the staff who runs it.   THANK YOU TO ALL of you who checked on me, cared for me, reassured my frightened wife and made me VERY comfortable in one of my more venerable moments.   Much obliged to all of you!<//Text>< GmapID>

< review>
In my entire life I have never been ripped off by a business as bad as what Sharp Memorial did to me.  I went to the emergency room to have a bicycle injury looked at, which had occurred about 7 days prior.  I talked to a doctor for no more than 10 minutes, who said I had a hematoma, and he ordered an x-ray, which I protested at first but since he's the doctor I agreed.  After the x-ray and 2 more hours of waiting, a Sharp Payment Person came to my bedside and told me I had to pay a "deposit" of $1500 of which I might get some of it refunded.  As soon as I paid, the doctor came and told me my x-ray showed no broken bones which I already predicted, and he told me to ice the bruise and sent me on my way. Big Surprise, there was no refund and the "deposit" turned into exactly what I owed them!  It was a trick, they lied to me.  THEN a week later I got another bill in the mail for the x-ray, THEN another week later I got a bill for "Emergency Services". Total cost for 10 minutes of talking to a doctor and x-ray: $1900. I don't have insurance because I can't afford it, and I guess the way the system works is people who don't have insurance get overcharged to the maximum. I later learned that if I had gone to one of those Urgent Care Clinics, the exact same service would have cost $170. I won't be going to Sharp Memorial again.
Edit: after receiving the response below from the Sharp "Patient Relations Team", I called the number and spoke to someone who told me that the bill I got is what I owe. I don't know what was the point of me calling except for wasting my time. But to summarize, if you don't have insurance then you are fair game to be ripped off with an absurd bill.  $1900 for 10 minutes with a doctor and a few x-rays!!!! Unbelievable.< /review>

I can believe the lack of concern they have here, just because of the war I look. When in all actuality probably knew more then them. Do not waste your time here.< /Text>

This hospitals billing department is disgusting, immoral, unprofessional! They get ZERO STARS! It's been brought to my attention just a couple of days after my cousins husband passed away there ,she was sent the bill (insurance paid it all of course) but how dare they!Shame on you! Why can't you wait at least until the family griefs for a min before  you start asking for payment! 30 yrs in the collection industry and we have more respect then that! SHAME ON YOU!<//review>

I would say about this place that it was great. I love the way the place felt when I was admitted when I had a problem with my liver. I like the fact that when they were about to put in the Porto cut needle they didn't do so without numbing the area so that the patient wouldn't feel any pain. The only problem I had is that the kitchen people in there were rude when I didn't know I had to have a nurse come with me. They were very disrespectful to me and my wife when I was admitted. Also had an issue with the MRI scanners who would not follow my request to slow the intake of the scan fluid so the nurse that was on my last watch she was with me cuz my doctor requested it. I had told them I felt pain while the fluid test was inserted and they didn't want to pay attention. So until my doctor and the nurse were with me I didn't proceed with the scan until they were told to slow down the insertion of fluid. Other then that I recommend it as the best hospital any then I have ever been too.<//text>

<rating>2</rating><review>I went to the emergency room at 1am in a last ditch effort to deal with persistent nausea and resulting dehydration, and to be fair everyone was nice, but extremely unhelpful in actually dealing with my situation. They kept trying to investigate and treat "pelvic pain" even when I insisted that I was not experiencing that, and just needed emergency fluids and something to keep me from continuing to throw up. 5 long and exhausting hours later, I did end up getting an IV, which helped, but they sent me away with a pain/inflammation prescription instead of an anti-nausea one. When I realized what had happened later in the day when I went to fill it, and called them back to get the correct prescription, I was told that I couldn't have that done over the phone and would have to come back for another appointment. I don't have the time or energy or finances to drive half an hour, wait around for who knows how long (my wait last night was nearly 2 hours) and pay for an appointment again to correct their mistake when I was very clear about my symptoms, so I guess I just get to suffer at home for a while longer.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d9555f40070df1:0x7c4c50bfdc73c9f5<//gmap_id></record>

I had extreme stomich cramps and I was in and out of there within two hours and they helped me with my insurance. My doctor was very nice and so were the nurses. I am NOT a hospital person I do not like doctors and I do not usually trust hospitals but this experience really changed my outlook on this!<//review>

We are at the Sharp Memorial Hospital,  where yesterday and doctor Rene Sanchez performed a surgery at one of the three aneurysms that my wife has on her brain.
Dr Sanchez did an excellent job as he always have,  he has performed other related treatments for my wife when he was at Scripps.
She is now recovering and we are still at the hospital where we have one of the best nurses we ever have had from all the hospitals we have been.
Her name is CECELY,  ID 6338, she is the most caring,  kind and wonderful person,  we thank God for Dr Sanchez and the Sharp Memorial for all they do,  and to CECELY for the outstanding job and the love and dedication for what she does.
My wife Demetria and I say thank you and God bless you all.

<review>I was in the ER two days ago for possible blood clot after total knee replacement at UCSD La Jolla.  Dr. Kelly treated me, ordered all the appropriate tests and was able to releave my anxiety of a possible blood clot
He was kind, caring and understood my need to get home ASAP to take care of my 87 year old mother.  I have been a UCSD LA JOLLA patient for years.  Since Jacobs got involved in UCSD it has gone to the feeling of being involved in a "cattle drive ".  Sharp Memorial is now my facility of choice for all my medical needs.  Thank you Dr. Kelly !!  You are a credit to the medical community and for the record, I am not easily impressed.

When I arrived there they gave me confidence, and treated me well and were very knowledgeable in treating me. I went in coming from scrips memorial La Jolla being told I had multiple esclerosis, it was frightening and I felt like I needed a second opinion with sharp. They clearly knew what they were doing and their team was very proffecional and help me find what my condition was. They made me feel at home and were very respectful towards me. I would call them Ángels of god because they gave me lots of hope and never left me alone from the nurses to the doctors. Thank you sharp memorial for saving my life.</text>

<Text>Where do I begin, I was recently diagnosed with a very rare syndrome and had to check into Sharp for an angiogram. From start to finish everyone that I encountered was amazing. Everyone was so understanding of my situation and going that extra mile for me. Mario ER nurse was so great, he put me at ease given the circumstances. Christy, thank you for stealing me a sandwich so I could get something in my stomach before midnight. Sharp employees really had an impact on me. I am going to be going in for neurological surgery in a couple of weeks and I really wish it was at sharp :)<//Text>< Rate>

Very clean hospital but somewhat confusing in terms of finding patient rooms.  There are two wings and the lady working at the front desk was not sure where the patient was and directed me in one direction. Luckily it was correct one.   Parking could be cheaper.< /Review>

<Text>There's always that one doctor who is in too much of a hurry and doesn't want to do their job. Currently at #SharpMemorial most of the RNs and MDs have been great, rushed but attentive. We get to Dr. Courtney O'Rourke who sees mom for 2 minutes and then refuses to speak to me.  Currently waiting on a response or a patient advocate. I'm done with these discharges without proper care and then having to end up here again.  You want to discharge, fine but make sure she has what she needs.  Refusing something as simple as an optichamber but worst refusing to talk to me? I hate to call people out on the internet but seems to be the only way you get people to listen when all that matters is a reputation.

I can't say enough about Sharp urgent care !
The place was clean, efficient and the staff was as friendly as anywhere I have been. I had chronic hiccups. They took really good care of me .
Nurses and the Doctors where outstanding ! I was visiting from out of town. So I wish I did live in this area !
(Doctor name Dr.Buna  I believe.) She even called the next day to make sure everything was okay with me.
Thank you , Thank you !<//text>

I will tell you my nightmare of what happened to me...
They had me wait on the lowest acuity level for a kidney infection over 3 hours! And the waiting room only had 10 ppl ahead of me when I got there. Once they finally called me back to a bed, I sat there for over an hour waiting for the nurse to make his way over to me. I asked several times during this hour if the nurse could help us. And was completely ignored. Instead I sat in a room on the chair because the gurney had blood all over it and IV trash on the floor from the last patient, and was given no pillow, no sheet, no blanket nothing but a gown and expected to strip down. Umm I don't think so. No vitals were taken when I was put there and they didn't even show me where the call button was. All the while we sat there listening to all the staff right outside the curtain talking about how much they got paid, where they prefer to work, what their plans were for the rest of the weekend etc. guess they all were too busy thinking and planing how to spend all their easy made money working at that crap hospital where no one is held accountable for actually lifting a finger.
I finally had to walk out and went back to the front desk and demanded to speak to patient advocacy or who ever it was in charge of that role at the late hour on a Friday night. The audacity of the charge nurse to tell me she was that person--uhh no I want to speak to your boss! Since the charge nurse thought it was okay to talk to me asking me if I was going to leave for good or was I gonna come back and continue to wait so she knew if she could give my bed to someone else or not.
After all of that I told the charge nurse I wasn't going back in that room until it was cleaned properly and given a pillow or blanket or something.
So finally all of a sudden they went back in and cleaned the gurney properly, and picked up a few of the pieces of trash on the floor, and found a pillow. next I know the doctor walks in before even meeting the nurse. The doctor was nice, but definitely in a hurry which is understandable. I asked for cultures to be done he said okay, I asked if I was going to get an ultrasound he said no since my lab work definitively was a kidney infection--okay no problem. Finally I meet the nurse! And am finally given oral pain meds at 11pm when I had been there since 730pm. Then given 1 dose of oral antibiotics and discharged 30 minutes later.
Here I am 5 days later still with the kidney infection--having to repeat multiple tests and switch the antibiotic all because my ER visit to Sharps was not thorough enough apparently. Now my doctor is worried that I may have developed kidney damage as the result! She couldn't believe I was given an ultrasound so now I have to get that done also.
Thanks Sharps! And no thanks to that Sharp experience ever again!!< /text>< Time>

My mother is in the Stephen Birch hospital, I am staying with her so I can help her. I visit the coffee spot. My sugar decides to drop, the lady was going slow. So I said excuse me to get her attention, she ignored me. I then snapped my fingers, and said hello loudly,  I explained my sugar was low if it was going to be long I would go get a soda to bring my sugar up. She rolled her eyes, and said mine is next
Most diabetics that go to leverl 32 sugar will get very angry at th8s reaction, I'm used to low sugars, so my sensible side said breath deep, and let it go. Called to convey if this happens again treat it better.  No call back. A few days later I go to the cafeteria,  the vending machine scanned my card. Gave me a menu then asked if I wanted a receipt emailed
I knocked on the door to see if my card was going to be charged,  they tried to ignore me. I of course knocked louder then I said I just have a question.  She didn't care, she says were closed, see 8f there's a number if not nothing you can do. What?? I will be charged for getting nothing?? Then I said thanks for your non help. She gets very sarcastic in her replies. Very very very rude staff. I would rather go to the la jolla hospital.  This one needs staff retraining.<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Levinsohn and the Staff of 4 North are the ABSOLUTE BEST!  I hear your motto is the "Sharp Experience" and I have to admit your Hospital, Providers and Staff live up to that motto.  My Wife underwent a knee replacement and never have I see such Professionalism, true care and concern for the Patient and overall attentiveness.  Both my Wife and I have worked in the Medicine field for over 30 years each.  My Wife is a Nurse Case Manager and I am a retired Navy Chief Hospital Corpsman.  I cannot think of anything better to say about this caring group of wonderful people who cared for my Wife.  My Wife and I would like to formally recognize the following staff members:
Dr. Leninsohn:  Surgery was OUTSTANDING, my Wife has absolutely no complications and 4 days after discharge, reached a 95 degree knee flexion.
The Outstanding 4 North Staff:
RN Diep
RN Beth
RN Mike
RN Heizel
P.T. Jesyka
P.T. Natalie
P.T. Linsey
RN Stacy
CNA Rida
CNA Marykay
CNA Vanessa
CNA Daniel
Stacy
Carley
Carmen
Nila or Mila - Hostess

Please recognize all of these fine Staff members for the above and beyond care they provided to my Wife!  I would recommend anyone to receive their care at Sharp Memorial where we certainly experienced the Sharp Experience and encourages others who need Health Care, Surgery and Hospitalization to look no further and go to Sharp Memorial for all your healthcare needs.  In this day and age it is very nice and comforting to know that their are Organizations such as Sharp Memorial out their.  They treat their Patients just like Family.  My Wife and I extend our heartfelt thanks to all who contributed to her care.  Thank you sincerely, Nick and Judith Coppola.<//Review>

I had to come here because my main Doctor wasn't available for a few days. Nurses are great, but doctors brush you off. Each year (and this is in my records) I get bronchitis and have to receive antibiotics or I'm sick for weeks, but because it's flu season and some symptoms match, I must have the flu. Cost me $250 and a three hour wait for no help. When my main doctor finally had an opening to see me, I was told I have bronchitis (go figure) and was given antibiotics. I would have been sick for weeks.< /review>

<Time>1507335432046< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Sharp Memorial Hospital is one of the best hospitals in San Diego County.The Rady Children's Hospital - world renowned for its cancer research - is located on the hospital grounds, as well as the Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women and Newborns; the Sharp Rehabilitation Center and the Mesa Vista Drug Treatment and Behavioural Center,are all subdivisions of this marvelous clinical complex.
They are located at the prominence of the Kearny Mesa Area and can easily accessed off of either the  north or southbound I 163 exits to Genesee  east, or else by using the Mesa College Drive east exit ; or the southbound I 805 west exit all leading Health Center Drive and then to Frost Street.
Sharps also has two on site public pharmacies that are open from daily from to 9am to 6pm - they are closed on weekends and holidays.
I have been to Sharp Memorial a few times over the last two years: I found them to be an excellent organization that cared for me; I felt very comfortable and that they cared for me better than my own siblings have done (After one of my surgeries, I didn't even receive one visitor; I guess that maybe I've never really had any friends?).
During the time I was an inpatient I was brought hot and beverages; the food was very good and they even had a menu. I was even offered warm blankets, when I said that I was cold ( The reason that most hospitals are kept /"cold" is to prevent the spread of germs.).The phlebotomist who drew my blood awesome, as I didn't feel a thing
I was also given a complimentary transit pass, as well as a complementary cab fare - on several occasions - when I had no one to help me get back home; the cab fare was a great help as it was very early in the morning (It was cold and rainy and I would have been left all alone; incidents that took place between Feb. and March of 2017.).
All in all the hospital was extremely clean, the staff seemed to go out of their way to make a personal connection with me - as a patient - and I thought that their 'caring attitudes' were wonderful attributes to their credo that they have attached to themselves as front-line caregivers and leaders  within the San Diego community.
I would like to thank all of those who have treated me for the wonderful jobs that they have done, even though we have had a few disagreements, this is only a small part of my whole life's story.
Since this is a review and whenever I write an evaluation I try to focus on the positive aspects of my experience(s) - I don't review any place that I frequent more than twice that gets below two ☆'s,however anything can change.Three M.D.'s that I saw years before I started using Sharp Memorial will soon get their chance; anyone is free to dispute a negative review..<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Very Very horrible experience to this Sharp Hospital. At the night time, maybe they don't have enough doctors to take care for the patients. If you have extreme pain, you will wait to die in this hospital at the night time. My mom had an extreme abdomen pain, we came at 11:30pm at night time. When we entered to the front desk, they already said we have to wait 3 or 4 hours to see the doctor. I was very surprised because the patient has an extreme abdomen pain but they don't care what going on to the patient. I have no choice to go another hospital because it was almost midnight. We have been waiting 3 hours already, but we are still waiting outside the lobby with the pain and no ones care for my mom . They gave my mom the pain medication but it didn't work at all. I hope they can have more the doctors work at the night time schedule , so it can helps solving the problem.<//Review><UserId.>115366494501196978624< /UserId.>< time>

I have just returned home from 17 days in Sharp Memorial Hospital.  I can't say enough about the doctors and staff.  The hospitalists that saw me, Dr. Drouin and Dr. Trang, were communicative, warm, caring, and even displayed a sense of humor.  The "god syndrome" was definitely lacking in these wonderful men.  In addition, the nursing staff, the nursing assistants, the entire staff, made a sterile environment for a sick person as palatable as was possible.  The single rooms were also conducive to healing; provisions for family and friends to visit or stay with a patient also seemed unique.  As far as I am concerned there is only one hospital, and that is Sharp Memorial.  Thank all of you who shared in helping me to heal and return home.< /text>

The hands down worse experience I've ever had at an ER. I took my 5yr old there, checked in and waited for 4 hours. I ask the nurses what's going on, they say that they cancelled her spot because they "called her name and we didn't answer". Thus isn't true, cause I was sitting right next to the nurses station with her waiting the entire time. The nurse then says that she can recheck me... really? After sitting next to the nurses station for FOUR HOURS with a 5yr old who is in pain, you want to recheck me in? What kind of ER is this? I've served in the military for the last 10 yrs, been to ERs all over the country and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. How does it have such a high rating when they can't even manage calling out someone's name in a lobby? I'll never take my children here again, I'll drive the extra 30 mins to another hospital.< /review>

Emergency Room:

I took my girlfriend here at one point and she stayed for over 6 hours just to get two bags of IV fluid following a diagnosis of severe dehydration. It took three hours to get seen by a doctor, and she was in a bad state entering - shivering, delirious, hardly able to speak or walk.

After that we waited another hour just to be told we could leave and that she was fine.

Nurse Help Line:

During our trip to Hawaii recently my girlfriend called in to ask the nurse line for advice regarding nausea. She had been hospitalized a day or so before with a standard case of food poisoning, and she called to ask if feeling nauseous after a meal was normal. She was told by the nurse that she must immediately seek emergency medical care within the next four hours at 2am in the morning, on the other side of the island. I woke up to her crying her eyes out, afraid that she had something horribly wrong with her health. All this because she encountered nausea - a normal symptom of food poisoning - a day after the initial event. She had no symptoms other than an upset stomach.

One of the worst hospitals I've ever been in. Waste of money having to go here, and waste of time. Also rude and insincere people, who don't know one thing about patient confidentiality. If you want to be treated less than how you deserve, DONT GO HERE! I came here at 10 pm because I was feeling very sick and throwing up, and I had to wait almost an hour in the waiting room, then I was given a "room" and forced to change into a loose gown, there is really no privacy and it made me uncomfortable. I spend 5 hours there and 95% of the time was spent waiting. I was really depressed so the waiting made it worse.</Review>

Beware of Dr Carter in emergency.  My son had chest pains, on the discharge papers he put rib pain, not so.  Was referred to a cardiologist.  He spent most of his time interrogating him on alcohol, drug use, which my son is not into.  Had hardly anything to say about why we were there, just that it might be stress.  My son doesn't use drugs and hasn't had a drink in over 2 months, and then only occassionally.  Emergency room care has definately gone downhill.<//review>

The ER department was great. I came in as a transfer from Grossmont. The bedside of one of the nurses I had in 5 north were terrible. I was in an extreme amount of pain and I overheard her telling another nurse I needed to "get over it" as if having kidney reflux due to being unable to urinate after surgery while I have a Stent placed in my kidney is something that isn't painful. The doctor released me without seeing me. I'm now at home in an extreme amount of pain and all they gave me was Tylenol with codene. I'm not a pain pill person, but this hurts and Tylenol with codene has done nothing.<//text>

Ok here it is. I HATE hospitals. It's nothing bad that's ever happened just hate them. I had the experience of having to go just last night. At the entrance I started to have a light weight panic attack.. Nothing wrong just I HATE hospitals. Paving in the Libby a nurse asks if I need a wheel chair and was I ok. She snapped me back to reality. I was not that sick .15 minutes I was back in ER with a gown on!! YES 15 min. Now here comes the anxiety.. Dr comes iMALE! I ask for a woman Dr.. He provides heather, a Dr in training I'm sure. She was very warm and her bedside manner almost made me feel like my sister was holding my hand all the way thru it and my real sister was there. She calmed me down and back in came the Dr. This man LISTENED !!! I gave him my story. He made sure I was completely relaxed and trusted what he was saying and I could not have asked for a better physician. He was surrounded by a friendly and outgoing staff who would make the sickest person smile. If I ever need emergency services I will want to go here! THANK YOU DR SIDRANSKI ((SHON ) AND THANK YOU HEATHER!!!

< Review>
I cant say enough BAD about this hospital....I can NOT believe what they did, well did NOT do for my son...He has been into the ER 4, yes, I said FOUR, now FIVE times with chest pain...all EKGs at the FOUR visits and the bloods tests showed NO heart problems....So his primary dr. ordered a stress test.  Dr. called him Thurs (this is Saturday) and said the stress test showed part of his HEART is NOT getting enough blood, was referring him to Cardiologist and an angiogram.

Dr. called my son again last night (Friday) and asked how he was feeling, had he been feeling dizzy or anything...Son said, yes, been dizzy for last week and a half, chest is like pressure on it and hard to breath...Dr said "GET TOT HE HOSPITAL NOW ! ! ! !"

ER said EKG was a little abnormal THIS time, they gave him Aspirin and Nitro spray, it helped the chest tightness and breathing,  they admitted him.....he saw Cardiologist today (Saturday) and this Dr...*(does he DESERVE a capitol D?) said, that probably the reason it looked like his heart wasn't getting enough blood was because of his "FAT" ! ! !?????   He didn't think there is anything wrong with his heart.   But he was sending him down for a test to see if any blood clots in his lungs or legs.    Nothing there so they decided to RELEASE HIM.....NO instructions as to what NOT to do or what TO do, no instructions to at LEAST take aspirin daily....He is referring my son to Mira Mesa OUT-Patient for another type of test, a CT angiogram, because this is less dangerous than the regular Angiogram....and they do NOT have this HIGH TECH equipment AT the HOSPITAL, ONLY at OUT-PATIENT?????

If Cardiologist doesn't think he has any artery problems, then why NOT do the Angiogram, can't HURT and would show for SURE if there is or isn't problem with blood supply to the heart, how do we know that this so-called "better" test won't be able to show any problems either, due to my son's "FAT"????

OH...and the KICKER, as he left, they said to my son, "Come back if you have any more chest pain."    .......what do you think he SAID?   What would YOU say?   NO THANKS....of course, until he can change insurance, he is STUCK with Sharp....HOPING to get him on Medicare and a SUPPLEMENT so he can go to ANY doctor and ANY hospital that is a Medicare provider.....

I am SoOOO FURIOUS, instead of bringing GROSSmont's standard's up to Sharp Memorial's, they are bringing Sharp Memorial's DOWN to GROSS's standards.   oh, I mean Grossmont...s'scue me.

SCRIPPS, no better healthcare anywhere.....It won't allow me to put NO stars, so I HAD to put at least one, it does NOT DESERVE even ONE! ! ! ! !</Review>

(Translated by Google) Heavy service and the type of doctors they say they are. .. yesterday you went there because the paramedics took me emergency. and they only left me in a room without solving my problem waiting for me to be treated, and they never followed me up, I lasted 4 hours without anyone arriving and when the doctor finally arrived and it just seemed as if I was playing. I spent 6 hours waiting for results that I never received and I never saw a study. and I decided to withdraw ... from the place .. the worst of the case was that they didn't give me any medication for my headache that was strong. I do not recommend them. That hospital is inhuman.

pesimoservicio y el tipo de medicos q segun dicen q son. .. ayer usteve en ese lugar por q los paramedicos me llevaron de emergencia . y solo me dejaron en un cuarto sin resolver mis problema esperando q me atendieran, y jamas me dieron seguimiento, dure 4 horas sin q nadie llegara y cuando por fin llego el medico y  solo parecia como si estuviera jugando . dure 6 horas en espera de resultados q jamas e me entregaron no vi nunca un estudio.  y decidi retirame... del lugar .. lo peor del caso q no me dieron ningun medicamento ni para mi dolor de cabeza que era fuerte .  no se los recomiendo. Es inhumano ese hospital.<//review>

<review>Delicious sandwiches!! And super friendly staff!!  I really like their turkey and cheese sandwich! Also, I called and asked for a special request - marbled rye - to surprise my boyfriend since he couldn’t find any. They graciously sold me a loaf and sides of pastrami so we could make the sandwiches later that evening after their closing time. It made him very happy and I’m grateful for this awesome shop! 🙏💕< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Insanely delicious. Updated for 2020: I have to take away two stars, if you see the photo of my sandwich below this was the way it was made back in the day. Back when the owners were a little different, I believe there may have been two of them I'm not sure. And the staff there was different. Ever since I noticed one of the owners and some of the staff gone I couldn't help but to see the the sandwiches weren't as good as they were before. And I attribute this mostly down to proper portions to make a sandwich delicious. The reuben sandwich you see in the photo is not what you'll get anymore, now you will get one so overladen with meat that it just might as well be a meat sandwich, corned beef is a salty meat, no need to over do it. Granted it still tasted good, but over a year ago visiting on a weekly basis they weren't good, they were fantastic. I probably hit the place up 4 more times in the last year and it's just not what it used to be. Proper portions make all the difference.<//Review>< response>

<text>They make my most favorite sandwich ever.  I get the veggie on sourdough + add turkey.  I crave it like all the time!  Great staff too - kind people always making me feel welcome.  Thank you, VSC.  Will continue to spread the word about your awesomeness. 🥪<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Exceptionally great service and food. Ordered online and picked up, efficient and easy. Well, maybe a five mins later wait but understandable, there were quite a few people there, evident of a good establishment. Highly recommend.</text>

<Text>XLNT Sandwiches, all varieties tried (turkey, tuna, corned beef, pastrami).  Sides are generous and tasty.  Beef and turkey sandwiches are HUGE!  Usually have not finished a whole sandwich in one meal.  Fast service< /Text>< date>

Best sandwiches in Ventura!  Hands down!  And, a gluten free bread option for wheat/celiac sufferers.  Their meats are Boar's Head, also gluten free, and are of the highest quality with wonderful taste!  Lov'em.< /text>

This is the best sandwich shop! They only use Boar's Head meat, cheese and bread.  Many options.  You can modify your sandwiches. You can make a sandwich into a salad.  They have soup, kid sandwiches,  chips and a variety of beverages. I've been going there since they have opened and I have never been disappointed.  The staff is also amazing and friendly.< /review>

Honestly the best sandwiches ever!  I highly recommend the Turkey Club on either sourdough, ciabatta or a white roll! My husband has tried quite a few of their sandwiches (Aztec Roast Beef, Pastrami, Reuben, Corned Beef, and of course the Heart Attack ) and has loved all of them!  The customer service quality tends to vary depending on the day but overall, I highly recommend checking them out!! It's best to place a phone order as they do get a bit busy and rightfully so :)<//Text>

Veggie sandwich not bad, bread tastes freshly made. Roast beef sandwich average according to fiancee. Small, hard to find place but popular. Good prices. Friendly service.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing sandwich shop in Ventura. Make sure to try the turkey club on sourdough!

Parking can be a little tricky be so close to the hospital but with the new wing open it’s much better.

Inside has only a few tables but you might be able to sit outside.

Food is priced reasonably and tasty! Give it a try.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The Sandwich Board had a lot of choices of bread but by the time I got there they only had two choices of bread left. So I got a bread that I really didn't want. I wanted sliced Sour Dough but I got a White Roll. I really loved that they use Boars Head Deli products! Boars Head is one of the BEST Deli products out there!! I got Turkey, Roast Beef and Munster Cheese. Even though I got a White Roll and not Sour Dough the Sandwich was good because turns out they they do give you somewhat a good amount of Meat in there Sandwiches, so I was really happy about that! The only thing that I wasn't to Crazy about was that my Sandwich was Really "Dry"! They put VARY LITTLE amount of Mayo, Deli Mustard and Italian Dressing on my Sandwich. Don't know if that's how they normally make them or if that's just how mine came out? I Really like my sandwiches with just a bit extra more Mayo and Mustard on my sandwiches. So that's why I gave them 4 Star's out of 5.<//Review>< pictures>

I would of gave 5 stars, but there was a lot of construction going on. So... Everything was Very Good, and just like the last person that posted; I had the turkey sandwich on sourdough.  👍👍 Service was Good, Food was Great.</text>

<review>Great place for sandwiches. Not anything like a chain fast food sandwich shop, they make proper tasty sandwiches with quality Boars Head deli meats. One of the best choices for sandwiches in the county. The Heart Attack sandwich isn't listed on the normal menu, but is well worth trying if you like a big hearty sandwich.< /review>< Name>

The meat and vegetables are fresh! The bread is terrible! Staff is kind and accurate.  Ambiance is faded and cold. I'm not sure what the fuss is about. Who cubes pickles for a sandwich?</review>

<review>I'll take this place over subway any day. Its different. I always get mine with squaw bread. Even their potato salad is pretty good. Try it. Same building as Ventura Spaghetti Company I believe but on the other side facing the hospital.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Just passing through, looked up a few good sandwich places and this place topped the list. As soon as you walk in you can smell that their meats are high quality. We ordered the hot Italian to split.

I needed a break from being with my daughter at the hospital, and hadn’t eaten in 24 hours. The cafeteria which is usually decent wasn’t good enough, I wanted a sandwich. Walking across the parking lot n there was a sign. The  Ventura Sandwich Company! I ordered the Aztec Roast Beef sandwich and chit chatted with the counter guy, sorry forgot his name. It was a damn good sandwich!! The counter guy was very nice n kool! He asked if I liked clam chowder, I said I loved it! He returned with a free half a bowl sample, to my surprise, it was also very delicious!  It was the perfect combo! Don’t be misguided by the outside, give it a shot!  It’s a nice little shop with character. I will be back, and with friends!< /review>

Hot pastrami was good, but at $14 ea it's pretty pricey. Add chips and a soda will run close to $20.  If you're a well paid health care worker, the cost is no big deal. For us other plain employed, it is a big deal.< /Text>

They have nice selection of hot and cold sandwiches and salads... my husband has tried the turkey with avocado, the pastrami and hot roast beef. I've had the cold roast beef all three visits, but on different breads. Everything we've tried has been freshly prepared, tasty and service is fast. Their food is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. When we want a good deli sandwich again, Ventura Sandwich Company will get the call.< /review><response>None<//response>< pictures>

Really great sandwiches, one of the best in town I'd say. Could use a bit of better communication between the register and the people making the food, they've made my order differently than how I've asked for it a couple times, but we're always happy to fix it. Definitely earned the 5 stars</Review>

This place is the ultimate rip-off. I went there today based on all of the good reviews this place has. I paid 9 bucks and change for their Aztec Roast Beef sandwich. What I got was a slab of beard, maybe 2 ozs of roast beef (and that's being generous), some unripened tomato, and some other condiments. Total rip-off (if I could give less than 1 star, I certainly would have).</Review>

Best Pastrami Sandwich in town.  I'm a big fan of the Pastrami at Togo's but this 805 sandwich is incredible.  They don't cheat you on the meat, that's for sure.  Very friendly workers.< /Text>

Comfortable, quaint stay in a great location. My only complaint is that the walls are very thin, so we could hear everything going on in the room above us (super loud footsteps). Try asking for an upstairs room so you don’t have this issue!<//Review>

<text>The Grove Inn is in a residential neighborhood and a good location. We had room 17, second floor, deluxe queen with bay windows. Not a spacious room but sufficient for our needs. I was having surgery at UCSF. Husband stayed 2 nights.  It was very clean, had been remodeled and deluxe bedding which was very comfortable for a good nights sleep.  Nice clean hot shower with new upgraded fixtures. About 10 pm a firetruck and some noisy cars came by and I thought it may be too noisy for me but after that, everything went quiet for the evening.  We felt very safe and saw no homeless on the streets close by. There was no alarm clock in the room therefore using my cell phone for that. Also because of covid, there was no breakfast service and they have a no contact checkin. We did not turn on the tv. There was a nice floor fan with several settings on it which we didn't need. The hosts were very accomodating and very pleasant to talk to on the phone. Even willing to switch our accomodations for a room with 2 beds had we needed it without add. charges. That was very kind of them. We would definitely stay here again. For us, location, safety, cleanliness, upgraded bedding, noise and parking fees were all factors in our decision to stay here. They did not disappoint.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808580a4c08c5a63:0x888af1a45c9d6192<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>We were in San Francisco for a couple of days for an event at Civic Center Plaza and wanted to find a place within walking distance. I'm so glad we came across The Grove Inn! On our check-in day, we arrived early. The room wasn't available yet, but we were able to store our bags and one of the Inn attendants gave us restaurant and coffee shop recommendations.

We stayed in one of the upstairs rooms facing the street and it was very comfortable! The place has a unique "old house" feel to it, which was very cool. For breakfast, there was coffee, tea, orange juice, fresh bread from a local bakery, as well as other assorted breakfast items (cereal, oatmeal, etc.).

Between the friendliness of the staff, the charm of the building, and the convenience of the location (walking distance to Alamo Square, many restaurants, and Civic Center Plaza), this is undoubtedly a place to which I'll be returning.</text><user_id>105467977864636649645<//user_id></record>

Comfortable bed, perfect location - I really got to feel like I lived in the city during my stay. In my room there was no mini-fridge, which is my one small criticism, but otherwise I had a great stay!<//text>

<text>Staff was very helpful. Continental breakfast was good. Hotel Location was great! 1 block from Alamo Square Park (awesome view of the city) & Painted Ladies houses. Easy busing (right on bus #22 line & 2 blocks from #5 line) very secure hotel & nice neighborhood. Excellent seafood (mom & pop) restaurant across the street.< /text>< Pictures>

This is a nice place for an overnight stay.  It is located in a mostly residential area, but it is noisy in the morning.  Also, finding parking can be tricky if you have a car.< /Text>

Property just as advertised. Excellent location. Staff friendly and helpful. Coffee and tea at the reception, all day around. Thoughtful housekeeping service (closed shut our window on a cold day while we were away). Will definitely stay here again.</Text>

The place smell like old urine the carpet smell bad from the front door all the way to the room I’m was disgusted to see that they have a rate of 8.8 On our arrival we were told that our room was being repaired and the receptionist was sorry and ask us to go for a walk and comeback in 2 hours that really made me angry we supposed to check in a day before but missed our flight in NY and we turned out one after and this man has the gut to excused for the inconveniences that the room as to be fixed , also the lady who was there as a receptionist or housekeeper her name is Anna she’s rude, racist and unprofessional she has no respect for their customers, doesn’t greet people and when addressing to you she doesn’t even the politeness to look at you, the bed linen are badly were off not iron look like it came out of the mouth of pigs , their breakfast it disgusting cheapest food that I cannot even feed my pet. Expedia you need to check out all the place and accommodations that you have in contract before advertising on your website.   I felt like you rubbed my money . The place need a renovation specially the flooring, there were no fridge in the room, the kettle it so small like a toy can only give one mug of tea at a time, no sink within the toilet you have to come out to the corridor to wash your hands . Big shame for you Expedia and the accommodation< /text>

Quiet quaint Victorian, helpful staff, unique room, was once a house I believe.  Only dislike was no safe for valuables and inability to adjust temperature in room besides windows.  Was a bit chilly at times, never too warm.  They at least searched for a heater for me but didn’t find one.  They did provide me a bar fridge however when I requested it, no charge.  Pleasant quiet stay<//review>

<text>Sweet Inn in a residencial area of San Francisco. The rooms are small but refurbished and comfortable. The morning coffee is good and the crossants are delicious. My only suggestion, make a bigger sign for your Inn. My cab almost missed the front door.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I planned to stay at the Grove Inn for two nights in July. We checked in late afternoon and everything seemed fine until it’s time to go to bed and we found a spider between our pillows. It was around 11pm at this point and front desk had left and there was not an emergency number that we could call. So we left the hotel and found another lodging arrangement. It is not reasonable to expect guests to stay in a room with bugs. We emailed the hotel immediately, with pictures, and time stamp, as well but did not get a response until the next morning. I have been trying to get a refund since but they claimed I stayed over the first night. We did not stay over the first night. I’d have loved to settle this between the hotel and myself but the Hotel is not cooperating. I also called Expedia, their 3rd party company handling reservation but Expedia would need their OK to process a refund. I don’t think it is fair to expect anybody to sleep in such condition. I don’t recommend you staying here at all for your own convenience.<//Text>< rate>

It was also a nice stroll downhill into Union Square. The rooms were very comfortable. We had booked for 3 nights but then decided to stay an extra two nights because our experience at the Grove Inn had been fabulous. The continental breakfast also was a great start to your day. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel to everyone.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>The Grove Inn experience was outstanding.  This is such a perfect center of the city location to explore from. Recently reopened after a renovation, The Grove Inn is clean, fresh, and warm & the beds were incredibly comfortable.  Josh & his mother Rosetta could not have been more gracious and accommodating. They gave us great local recommendations, offered an incredible morning artisan breads, freshly squeezed orange juice, wonderful coffee, in a sunny perfect people watching breakfast room & gave us customized directions to our walking destinations that included the best streets & beer gardens to check out.  The design and details of the inn are inspired by Rosetta & the families' Italian heritage. Just lovely. You will love The Grove Inn.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Nearly perfect but some suggestions. There is not one chair for toddlers in the breakfast room. Please get 2 or 3. And a parking space just for unloading and packing would be great. But recommend this Inn. Near Alamo Square. Line 22 stops right at the Inn. Big Bus stop is just a few minutes away. Rooms are very clean .< /Text>

<Review>The Grove Inn is a top find in the San Francisco area.  The location is around the corner from the Painted Ladies and within walking distance from several great restaurants and bars (check out Stone Bowl Plus , Wholesome Bakery, and the Noir Lounge).  The rooms were cozy and comfortable, and I loved that I was able to stay with my sister, husband, and toddler in the same space but give my sister a different room.  Wed definitely stay here again!< /Review></record>

This is a very sweet, but still clean and modern inn.  There is a continental breakfast that is more European than American, reminds me of a lot of breakfasts I had in hostels and hotels in Europe.  The breakfast isnt super impressive, but will be enough to fill you up for a day of sight seeing.  When we arrived, someone showed us our room but mentioned that there was a suite available if we would rather have that.  We were traveling with an infant, so we were thrilled to have the suite with an extra room so that we could still have a light/the tv on after the baby went to sleep.  The only negative was that the inn did not have any cribs, which was somewhat surprising.  However, luckily I had called ahead to ask about the crib so we were prepared, and rented a pack-n-play from a baby rental service.  But that is the only negative I would say about the inn, so if you dont need a crib, then I would highly recommend.  I loved the area it was in, and actually booked the inn after asking a friend who recently lived in San Francisco where to stay.  This was not a touristy area at all, but felt more like when you stay in an air bnb and are really in a neighborhood where locals hang out and live.<//Text>

<review>We really enjoyed our stay at the Grove Inn in San Francisco. I have stayed in this area of the city before (Lower Haight) and enjoy it's location being a bit removed from the more touristy parts of the city. The bedroom was very comfortable and the bed linens were extra soft.<//review></record>

The staff/owners were really nice. The location is perfect if you are looking to get the real San Francisco neighborhood feeling. Buses from this area are so easy and gets you every where in the city. We had a good time on foot checking out the local shops and restaurants.</Review>

<Text>Location is ok but you need to walk 10 minutes to catch a bus into town. On their website they do direct you to a local parking garage a few blocks away. We stayed for a week and we would definitely come back and recommend the Grove Inn to our friends and family.< /Text>< Rate>

The service was eexcellent here. They always welcome you as you come in. The breakfast consisted of yogurt, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, orange juice, coffee. The bathrooms looked really nice like they were recently renovated. They had water, coffee, and tea in the room everyday.< /review>

<Text>My family and I had a wonderful experience at this place. The staff was very friendly. Bonna (Ihope I spelled that correct) greeted me and checked me in. She was awesome! She remembered me every time she saw me and would always take the time to chat with me if she could. We were on the first floor and didn’t really notice any noise. Breakfast was delicious and a nice selection. Parking was quite tricky at times. You have to make sure you read the signs. During peak times you could only park for 2 hrs. Overall, the stay was pleasant and I would stay there again. -KT< /Text></record>

Amazing stay. So much better than Union Square and Fisherman's wharf! You can have a real taste of San Francisco's life. Nice places in a walking distance, like Hayes Valley, Lower Haights and Fillmore and Divisadero Streets. The rooms are clean and well equiped and the staff is also very nice. They even have a breakfast.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Highly Recommend in SF

+ Cozy~ Breakfast was also provided, and I was able to drink fruit and tea in the evening. The staff were also friendly. And there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, and Alamo Square is a short walk above the hotel. He also gave me a heater.

-There is no elevator (the staff helped me when moving my luggage). The sink is missing the drip control, but it has not been fixed.

(Original)
Highly Recommend in SF

+ 아늑해요~ 아침식사도 제공됐고, 저녁시간에도  놓인 과일과 차를 마실수 있었습니다. 스텝들도 친절했습니다. 그리고 바로 앞에 버스정류장이 있었고, 호텔 위로 조금만 더 걸어가면 알라모스퀘어 있습니다. 히터도 주셨습니다.

- 엘리베이터가 없다는점( 짐 옮길때 스텝들이 도와주셨습니다). 세면대에 물빠짐 조절하는 게 빠져있는데, 고쳐져 있지 않았습니다.< /review>

Hôtel très bien situé proche des quartiers à découvrir. Le personnel est très accueillant, serviable et disponible. La chambre au rdc donnant sur une rue desservie par le bus est certes un peu bruyante mais les boules kies sont fournies. Chambre petite, vétuste, mais propre. Le petit déjeuner est super.Je recommande cet hôtel familial pour ceux qui fuient les usines à dormir.< /Text>

Wir würden jederzeit wieder dieses tolle Hotel in dieser wunderschönen Stadt buchen. Herzlichen Dank für diesen schönen Aufenthalt.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The excellent breakfast, the cleanliness, the availability of the staff, the silence and the tranquility of the structure, the convenience of the bus stops. In the room you will find tea and coffee. To reach the bed and breakfast from the Oakland Airport: take the free shuttle-funicular that connects to the underground system (bart). The blue line or green leading to San Francisco at the Embarcadero Station: Here you change to the city's subway (called muni) dropping to Church Station, then bus No. 22 to Fillmore and Marina, descending junction with Grove Street. Get coins or dollars counted for the ticket you take from the driver. Alternatively you can immediately buy the MUNI prepaid card from the metro stations. On McAllister Street passes the bus n ° 5, leading to the Golden Gate Park or Union Square.

(Translated by Google) Superb guest room in San Francisco. Very well located the only downside is the lack of parking space you have to move your car every two hours if you do not want to PV. Other than that very good even for a couple with two kids like us. Very nice breakfast with croissant fruit juice cheese we almost forget that we are in the United States.

(Original)
Superbe chambre d'hôtes à San Francisco. Très bien situé le seul bémol c'est l'absence de place de parking il faut bouger sa voiture toutes les deux heures si on ne veut pas de PV. À part ça très bien même pour un couple avec deux enfants comme nous. Petit-déjeuner très sympa avec croissant jus de fruit fromage on en oublierait presque que l'on est aux États-Unis.</Text>

<Text>When we checked inn the lady offered us her parking spot as she was just leaving. This was very helpful as parking is a bit difficult in that area.Only the room are a bit old (even though the bathrooms are updated).If they would invest in room doors which are really closing (and not leaving a gap) it would be one star more in the evaluation from my side.Overall it was nice and we would stay there again.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Please DO NOT bring your car here, I feel absolutely violated and taken advantage of. Prepare to read about the nightmare. This story is no over-exaggeration of the hell I am currently living in. As a woman who has never worked on cars, I trusted a man, the owner, named Abdul who called me his "friend." I needed a head gasket repair on my Suburu Forrester 2009 with 150k miles on it, a common repair for these cars. I trusted Abdul & expected to receive back a safe & reliable vehicle. Instead, I received the car returned with its internal organs beat up, ripped out, assaulted and damaged. My car is currently at a different shop, unable to be used because it's basically an unsafe bomb I refuse to risk my life driving in.

Initially, Abdul said he would cover the cost of any additional work that needed to be done. Upon inspection, the local shop said I would need a WHOLE NEW GASKET SET (they are already leaking) Abdul heard this and went back on his word, he decided he would no longer pay.
Feb 5th- I still have no car & there is so much damage that it may be less expensive to do an entire engine swap than to have all the individual components that ZIPIN OUT has broken fixed individually.

Here's the list of everything wrong:
They didn't replace all the gaskets & some of the gaskets that they did replace are leaking
Hoses not attached
Chipped bell housing
A broken transmission guide pin
Shot tie rod ends- why did they even touch these?
Bolts entirely missing or put in crooked
Wiring harness left dangling & wires for the spark plugs were just sitting on the engine, not put back in place.
Timing belt housing is loose & seems to be damaged but engine needs to be completely removed to inspect. There was ONE SCREW that wasn't even halfway in holding the housing on. (SEE PIC)
The biggest problem now is that the damage they caused when they messed up the pully system... Couldn't start the engine, per Abdul had to open and close 50 times, Pulleys are all chewed up and already damaged belts just from ride home, and his mechanic admits that he "forgot" to close housing once the car started and Abdul says he inspected but clearly not. SEE PIC
There's more that will probably need to be fixed but we don't know yet as we are filing a complaint with the BAR to inspect this car before we get more work done.

Essentially once the car would move they sent it out the door as fast as they could without even bothering to see where the bolts that were sitting on the floor went...

According to our local mechanic, it's likely that there is more work to be done due to their negligence. (Negligence which ZIPIN Out has acknowledged but refuses to fix.)

This is the exact reason I am so pessimistic to take my car into places to be fixed, the stereotype of the young lady being taken advantage of at the car shop holds true once again.

Consider me bitter, broke and stranded in Northern California. Thanks, Abdul, “Friend,” for the worst car experience in my life.

February 2021 Update.
We have filed a claim with the Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR). They found this job to be the worst job they’ve ever seen and found this shop to not be in compliance with their regulations. I had to get a full engine rebuild and now a year later my car is totally toast, they took every good piece out of my Subaru and swapped it with junk. CHOP SHOP ALERT!! I still car-less and now broke living in a rural area, which is extremely difficult. We are putting together our case and will be taking this shop to small claims court for justice for their unethical and immoral practices.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX21mf4lm9wkW-F4X9lZLW6FwXgQBM9raYEnso=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmboRpZoPh1aBb-S--SEQ5hpJoj5N-fc6UC4k4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7YIwwpzAwOBPEQGc4Lq6U_w6t4cJPUK0bg2Ec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOLQeRGTKlWXn8XuzC8qaGhMSWqwRcf13AteHI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNomzNZbz_3PY8hmKJaHVVZkqI4DVraGJbH9DoD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOrOS_l2CF1nLsgWg_1n8wpyudEPYJLig_kv8l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOMC45lOOspU5kNr_-963LF9v4Gz2TyPDZaJht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7LxL8WNEXwWbvoYht2oMODLFEvSW6bEO4ZkEw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-7scw7kxj3Sa-DNzzGuWaLT9TctKoUDwd-6dM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMonMpU2iMRvS2DNJOK5DeoV2O3U_hCQUsDy_Cl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBm25Kz6rmBcLHK0IkiDbEmCDYUAhm8hnWaoet=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnsV9ILTdMo7tQ3xgb3enAJpe0ts9hcx6H0ni2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Went in for an alignment from Groupon. When they started the alignment process came back to me and told me what the situation was and it was more than alignment needed. He educated me very clear and was  very straightforward and was not pushy at all I highly recommend this location.< /Review>
</record></dataset><record>
< text>
I like the owner and staff. Very friendly, patient to explain everything about the alignment process and how do they do. I wanted to see how do they align the tires and due to safety reason, they didn't allow me to be in the working area. However, they let me see the process from security camera monitoring system on ipad. They're full service shop and do all kinds of maintenance related to car like Oil change, break pads and rotors change, Tires replacement, alignment etc..</text>

If you are looking for a trusted auto repair shop, look no further. I own 3 cars oldest being 2002 to the newest being 2015 and take those cars to this shop. I was almost ready to give up on my 2002 model car after getting very high priced quotes from dealers, Midas, and the like till I found this shop by coincidence when I requested a hitch installation on my SUV through Amazon. Not only was I impressed with the service the first time, but it gave me confidence to bring my 2002 model car and get it looked at here. So glad I did. The car was fixed for almost half the price and it has been almost 4 years since and the car is still running great and use it for my daily commute. I have not gone to any other shop when I need repairs done even though the shop is quite far for me. I have gotten many different repairs done on my cars - regular service, brake drums, brake pads, new tires, wheel alignment, engine gasket replacement, engine oil pan change, tie rod, and bumper repair. The owner (Abdul) takes time to explain the problem, presents various options, provides guidance on parts quality, costs, urgency, and safety, and then gets the job done properly. Later when I needed a follow-up once or twice, it was smooth and they looked into it without any extra charge. Couple of times Abdul was nice enough to guide me to do the repair myself. Latest one was just this month when the same 2002 car had engine light popping up left and right, and I thought this is it. Each of the suggestions worked and the car passed the smog inspection with just $100 in repairs that I did myself for which I was quoted $400 for fixing just the first code, and more coming later. Suffice to say, I am a very satisfied and happy customer.< /Text>

<review>Abdul with ZIPIN OUT is the best, most trust worthy mechanic and mechanic shop my husband and I have ever experienced.  He is always very thorough, shows pictures  and explains everything. When he starts working if something doesn't need to be done after all he won't do it.  So at times the cost is less than the estimate.  He even pays to have his lobby professionally cleaned and sanitized for the comfort of his customers! My husband and I drive 1 hour and 15 minutes 1 way to see him (that's 2 1/2 hours round trip) , he's that good.  And what a great, smiley guy.  We both highly recommend Abdul and ZIPIN OUT!!!</review>< pictures>

<Text>I have had two experiences with Abdul and the Zipin mechanics and both have been great. He installed a trailer hitch on my SUV and later replaced all four brake pads as part of scheduled/routine maintenance. In every interaction with him and his team I have found them to be professional and honest in helping me understand what needs to be done, setting a fair price and delivering great work in the end. The hitch has been awesome and the brakes were fixed quickly and perfectly.

I think it says a lot about a mechanic when they tell you that you don't actually need to get a repair done yet. I had been told I needed all new struts, Abdul's team looked at my car and gave me a clear explanation why I didn't need them yet. It says a lot about the honesty of a mechanic when they turn down money when the easiest path is to do the extra work and take the money.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Abdul and his team are among the most trusted mechanics in the area. What's more, he's a gentleman who offers fair pricing and truly takes the time to explain what is happening with your car and reasons for any needed repairs.

<Review>We’ve gone to Abdul for many years, and highly recommend his services. He and his team of Subaru whisperers are miracle workers — they do reliable, high quality work at extremely affordable prices. We loved his work on our Subaru so much, that we started taking our other car (Mercedes) to him, as well! We would take any car to him, any day. And if you are taking BART after dropping your car off, or picking it up, he will even give you a ride to the station! What a guy!! Highly highly recommend. 😊</Review>< user_name>

Abdul is simply very personal and the price is more than reasonable.  I had my Lexus window fixed for half the price of other stores with Lexus certified windows.  I strongly recommend other to give ZIPIN OUT a try, as the driving distance is reasonable for all Fremont residents.</Review>

<review>First let me say this is absolutely not  a fake review.

I have two vehicles that I bring here for ongoing  and intermittent maintenance, 2006 Subaru Tribeca and 2009 Mercedes E550. They  just worked  on my Subaru as it was having multiple issues.  Two Pulleys had to be changed due to internal bearings being bad (extremely noisy), the drive belt was all chewed up and had to be replaced. My front brake pads had 5% wear left and had to be replaced and the rotors turned. They radiator was cracked, leaking a lot of coolant and had to be replaced. My AC was not working and I was afraid my AC compressor had to be replaced but after troubleshooting they told me it was only the relay that had to me replaced. After replacing the relay the AC works great. As you can see I had quite a lot of work done.  All the work cost me less than $1,000.  I consider this cost for all the work performed to be very honest and fair.

The owner Abdul is a joy to work with and is excellent at continually following up keeping me appraised on the status. He always shows me and explains the issues before performing any work. His cost quote estimates are always perfect. My vehicle was in the shop less than 24 hours this time. I consider this a very quick turnaround time to acquire all the needed parts and perform the work. My Subaru purrs like a kitten again

Zipin Out has my 100% confidence and I highly recommend this shop to anyone.  Cheers!< /review>< Pictures>

Abdul is so kind and respectful that I literally tow my cars all the way from Santa Cruz for him to work on because he is so honest and professional.   As a teacher commuting every day to San Jose, who also has two daughters driving older cars,  it is a challenge to keep all of my cars running.  Abdul has saved me many times.  I don't want to go anywhere else.<//text>

BEWARE! DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE! These guys are liars and scammers. We have filed a claim with the BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repairs) and we will be taking them to small claims court to recoup the costs we incurred to fix the damaged they caused. They do rough work that causes more damage to the car than help. I’m paying for their mistakes with a 3000$ bill from another shop.<//Text>

Zippin Auto is not perfect, like any mechanic, however I always trust what they are telling me about one of my vehicles and they always work very hard to make me a happy Client. They currently take care of all 6 of my vehicles and I will continue to give them my business, because trust is the most important piece of any vendor relationship.< /Review>

Best place to have any car work done. I came 2 minutes before they close and asked if you they can repair my car and make it start. They stayed back and fixed my car even after the shop was closed. The owner and the mechanics are very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend a friend to go to zipin out for all their car needs.</Text>

<name>Devon Powell</name><date>1450565330014< /date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I called in the morning for a quote on a serpentine belt replacement. They were less expensive than the big box companies and other local competitors, and were able to slip me in for an afternoon appointment that day (Saturday). Not only was the service excellent, but fast. Half-way through the waiting time, I called Abdul (He's the man), and asked him to take a look at my windshield wipers and a couple of other things and to give me a quote. After Abdul checked out the issues, he gave me a call and explained to me all my options, and gave me his personal recommendation. After about an hour and fifteen minutes, I got back to the shop and everything was done. Serpentine belt replaced, windshield wipers fixed and replaced, and a couple other minor fixes. Abdul reviewed to me all the work that was done and gave me a fair price. FAST, FRIENDLY, & FAIR.

UPDATE: I've been going to Zipin Out now for the last few months, and nothing has changed. Excellent service and work. Abdul is sincere and fair. I now send my girlfriend here for her automotive needs. I will continue my business here for a long time to come.</Review>< Pics>

Do not use this service provider through Amazon. I have already placed a formal complaint because the owner doesn't understand his contract with them. After I paid for the installation through amazon, the owner called me the day before the appointment to ask me about my car, which is totally fine, but then he tells me that he's going to have to charge me over $200 more for a service I already agreed to and paid for. I did tell him that I found someone that would charge me less and he said "you better be able to prove that you can get it for a lower price." Who says that to a customer? I understand price match but he made it sound like a threat. Be aware if you decide to use the mechanic.< /Text>

DO NOT come here. DO NOT get played. Very very unprofessional and shady business. Wait until the shady side comes out. The elder bald muslim Pakistani gentleman with white beard, played me badly with the religious act. The 2nd time I met him, he started a conversation about reviews out of the blue. I ignored it but now know what some of the complaints other reviewers are talking about. This guy had my car's engine replaced(bad pully) for a very bad conditoned engine. When they did replace the engine for the poor but still working one, they bolted closed only 2 of the 4 bolts on the cross member. I had a trip to SD with cousin for a funeral for my grandmother, and when I took right turns, the car would bump and lean towards the right each time. We had to drive carefully, in other words we nearly literally almost died. And to top it off, the younger Pakistani or Indian guy was walking back and forth like it was the UFC or something. Also the elder white beard guy with glasses(1st guy) kept mentioning different parts he "suggested" with higher prices each time. PLEASE do yourself a favor, save your money and your Car's life, stay away before you or your car is killed by these guys.<//text>

Provided good service and reasonable price.
My car was showing service engine soon(Nissan Altima, 2000 model) and failed smog test. So I went to this service center which is next to smog check center. They addressed all the problems and got smog cleared for me.<//review>

<user_name>Charlie Baltimore<//user_name><Review>I brought my car here, a subaru (their specialty) for about a year. The prices were extremely reasonable so everytime my subaru broke down which was about once a month I would bring it back for some minor but necessary repair which would run between 500-1200$, this is almost every month mind you!
After multiple fixes throughout the year the car had something new wrong with it, (it couldn't pass smog) and Abdul despite being a subaru mechanic could not pinpoint what was wrong, it would take some labor and investigation I was told.
Well, I took it somewhere else for a second opinion, it was an easy fix that they found immediately just by looking underneath the vehicle, just an old brittle rubber hose as it turns out. Since they've fixed the car up its run perfectly. Its not likely i'm going to bring my vehicle back to ZIPINNOUT. I have a funny feeling about the whole thing and also they left a cigarette butt in the vehicle...</Review><gmap_id>0x808fbf0d51895665:0x1c72b54840b1480a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worst workshop to visit. They cheat people for fake diagnostics.they cheated  me in tire puncture repair. First said 1 puncture and then Instead of 1 puncture showed 2 extra nails which they have and charged for 3 punctures. It's a big rip off for me.</text>

<rating>4</rating><review>Great convenient carwash. Pretty simple and affordable.  It's a self timed carwash. About a half a dozen slots so traffic moves in an out pretty quickly.  I wish there was an area to buy items you need while cleaning for people that just drop in like towels, windex,  car fresheners,  etc. Overall it's cool. Located right in San Leandro about 3 mins from Safeway on Estudillo.</review>< pics>

Updated to share more useful info:
They close at 10pm. Everything automatically shuts off.
$2.25 to start wash. 4 minutes. No tokens needed.
At each station you can use bills, change or credit/debit card. The credit/debit instructions state that the initial swipe automatically charges you for the $2.25 for 4 minutes. Each swipe after that before it times out adds another dollar.
** It also states that a $25.00 hold is placed on the card but when you are finished, the hold is released and  only the final cost is charged. ***
Didnt use the vacuum. But i can vouch for the wash station working. Came at 630pm on a Saturday and was able to wash my car right away. Only 1 stall out of 4 was occupied.
And at 8:30pm on a Wednesday.  3 out of 4 stalls occupied. Not crowded.
Great place to wash your car. Hassle free. The non token options make it so much easier.< /Text>

Great place to detail automobiles, very clean, excellent prices. Convenient store, well staffed and organized. Employees knowledgeable and friendly. Waiting area available. Handicap accessible. Plenty of parking. Near by stores, fast food, banks and attractions while you wait. Child friendly.  Would recommend.<//Text>

This is a nice office with comfortable lobby. The staff are very professional and kind. Dr. Tan definitely has many years of experience and wisdom with him and know when something is potentially serious or not.  Thank you Joshua Medical team!< /Text>

< Review>
My experiences here have all been positive. The staff is friendly and pretty informative. I never have to wait long in the waiting room or the patient rooms. And when my appointments are in the morning, there's coffee and tea available. Totally a plus in my book!

I've seen 4 different doctors there and they all took the time to talk to me and answer questions. The last doctor I saw, Dr. Tan, is more on the quiet side, so he didn't offer up much information on his own. You have to ask him questions and then he'll give you answers. His assistant was very friendly and helpful, too. She made sure I was getting their emails that provide the doctor's notes, diagnosis, test results, etc. I appreciate having access to this info online because it's hard to remember everything the doctor says, especially when they're treating you for a few things.

I do wish they allowed for walk-ins though because sometimes I'd like to see a doctor right away instead of 3 days later. This is why I didn't give 5 stars. But overall, I'm very happy with Joshua Medical.</Review>

Dr. Tan & the staff at Joshua Medical have always treated me & my husband with top notch care, concern, & wonderful follow up. I feel that I truly have one of the best Doctors & Doctors office in Orange County! I can't say enough good things about Dr. Tan, he listens & takes his time & he is so calming which is great when you are concerned about your health. The patient portal is the best tool & Dr. Tan always follows up the same day. The office has a great atmosphere with a tropical theme & you feel relaxed just being there, it helps to calm the nerves of going to the Dr.'s office.</Review>

I love that they are always smiling and greet us friendly. The wait time was not bad at all I would say like 5 minutes. Rule of thumb always arrive 10-15 minutes prior to your appointment time especially if it is a physical exam their will be forms that need to be filed out. Lawrence has great bed side manners and is a good listener. He addressed all of our concerns and answered ALL of our  questions. My son is 17 and loves Lawrence.   He is down to earth and will not rush through appointments. Can’t wait to see him again for my middle sons appointment next month. - Your favorite patients<//Text>< Resp>

Dr Wong is an excellent doctor, very caring and efficient.  Staffs are also very friendly.
Dr Wong always help out all the young future doctors who have the passion to become doctors. He always shares his knowledge and patiently explaining to the interns.
I have been to Dr Wong for the past 30 years, would recommend anyone to him.< /Review>

Dr. Tsai has been my children’s doctor for almost 7 years and I admire his patience and compassion he shows his patients. He is a great listener and thorough in his questioning. He is not only the Doctor to my two children, but he is my senior mother’s as well. He gets back to our voice messages in a timely manner and to our family is by far the best Doctor we have ever had! 🙏</text><user_name>Crystal Howard</user_name>< Pictures>

The Doctors/PA are fantastic and well knowledgeable in what they are doing. However, some of the Medical assistant at the  PA office are rude, disrespectful and heartless for that matter.  My kids were forced by some of the Medical Assistants  to clean the public bathroom with their hands because they accidentally left toilet lid on. When I became aware of the situation, I immediately called the Medical assistants not to forced my kids to clean their public bathroom. I told them that  If they (Medical assistants)  have any issues with their pediatric patients, they should inform the parents, in this case me. But three of the Medical assistants who yell at my kids to go and clean started talking loudly. Seeing that I quietly went and cleaned the toilet lid and afterward told them to hire someone to keep their bathrooms and clinic clean. Also, few times in the past I noticed the room they placed my family and I was not very clean. I was so appeal by the way my kids were treated. For goodness sake, and hospitals all over hire  professionals to keep their clinics clean and sanitize don't understand why doesn't this clinic do the same, instead of forcing their patients to do that. The medical assistant Joshua Medical Center need to know that it is a privilege to have patients come to your clinics. patients pay your bills.Treating them poorly would cause them to move their business somewhere else. A little kindness, compassion and respect can go a long way.<//text>

Without him and his team believing and working on trying to find a cure we would still be in a really bad place. Their team stuck by us and never gave up and now we have a diagnosis and a plan. Praise God !
When everyone thought we were lying you believed! Thank you for your care and support.</review>< Pictures>

Today is 9/12/19.  As usual, Dr. Mui and his assistants gave us the highest attention, listening to our description of physical illness complaints and provided us with thoughtful treatments. We know he has always a lot of patients waiting for him but he was still very patient and gave us plenty of time. He is alway a good model of what a true Jesus follower and loyal missionary should be - a light and salt of the world. Thanks again for you and for God who put you around us to help.< /review>

The staff and doctors are really nice but they need to work on seeing patient on time. Went with my dad to his 8:45 a.m. follow up appt, didn't see his doctor till 9:35 a.m. Even with that he was in and out within 15 minutes.< /Text>

I highly recommend Joshua Medival for any and all medical care.

<review>Organized, efficient, and caring doctor's. I have been seeing Lawrence Tsai for quite a while now. He's very compassionate and always takes the time to listen. He helped me with my CASDI and supports my cause. Always a pleasant experience coming here. Although I've moved 30 miles away, I still maintained this office as my PPO/HMO.</review>< UserId.>

Dr Tan and Dr Mui are great. Dr Tan had been our family physician for over 8 years. This has been their location for over a year and it doesn't make you feel that you are at a doctor's office. Check out my photos. Large lobby and friendly staff who are dressed in Hawaiian shirts!! One's high bp will be low once you sat in the lobby 😊<//review>

Such a nice quiet place to get tea, coffee, smoothies....my daughter and I drive past 3 coffee places to have our time together. The ladies are always helpful (I am terrible at deciding what I want!) and happy. They have quite the selection of beverages as well as some adorable gifts!</text>

< Review>
I'm in love with this shop.  They make their own coconut milk, chai, and honey lavender to name a few items.  But the moment one walks in, it's evident that the owner  has really put a lot of thought and passion into this establishment and it shows.

Love everything about this place from their in house recipes to the decor and the atmosphere.  Highly recommended.<//Review>

First time here and my significant other and I ordered the Banana Chai smoothie. No sugar added. You can taste the health in the smoothie lol in a good way. Will be back to try other things from their large variety menu!< /Review>

<review>This is my go to spot for the best cup of coffee. The one cup at a time brew process makes the coffee shine. I was hooked on the Midway brew but then I discovered the Metro. Staff is great, super friendly, they learn your drink preference and your name!. This is a neighborhood coffee shop.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80db7e77ddd25669:0xf8a94cf67991c658< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

< Review>
Great cute littoe coffee shop with plenty of options.  Love the matcha, but if you want coffee I always go for the honey lavender latte- a personal favorite! They carry good wholesome food too for if you need something on the go. Not cheap, but not anymore expensive than a Starbucks (And it feels better to support a local business than a monster chain).

Plus, if you drink it there you get to have it from their cute latte cups!<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><review>Great atmosphere, amazingly friendly and welcoming staff, fair coffee.
There just seems to be a lack of knowledge surrounding the traditional espresso coffee wares(which I realize is slightly a matter of opinion). I was given a dry cappuccino when asking for a macchiato and had to clarify a few times what was even meant by macchiato.
The black coffee was not as light a roast as I would like but that is purely a matter of taste so no fault there. It wasn't bitter or under extracted so I can't fault the personal decision to select this coffee, nor would I want to. The massive diversity in roasting is what makes discovering new shops so exciting.
The blueberry muffin was very good. Not overly sweet, medium density, subtle blueberry flavor which actually paired quite well with the black coffee.
Was able to try the nitro coffee on my way out which was very good for those who like the texture this process brings but want a more nuanced coffee experience.
Overall I'll be returning to this shop mainly because a.they are in a dry area for decent shops and b. The staff is worth the return trip making any other shortcomings easy to overlook.</review>< Pictures>

Very reasonable prices, extremely kind staff that even went out of their way to make a custom drink, super clean facility and delicious drinks! The blueberry matcha latte is to die for and we asked to get a raspberry lemonade with matcha made and it blew my mind! Definitely worth it!</Review>

<review>Great Cafe, highly recommend the iced matchas, especially the blueberry.

They offer non dairy milk options 😊</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn0lf2f5li5IZhs1M2yMP65L-cNQFybaUbmnzr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

I can see why this coffee shop gets raving reviews. Service is wonderful, and the selection is unique and wide. I went for a cappuccino, my usual menu item at any new to me coffee shop. They use different "milk" types, including almond.

If you order your drink to stay, you get it in a beautiful cup that many people posted pictures of. It is so vibrant and colorful! The drink was very good, and the atmosphere quiet and relaxed. On a Saturday afternoon there were few people there, but I can see how during business hours the coffee shop can get quickly filled up. Seating is plentiful, and decor is somewhat rustic with elements of industrial feel. I generally prefer cozier atmosphere, but to each their own.

I will absolutely come back to try their specialties, now that I established that their cappuccino is worth drinking :)<//Text>

I wrote a review about a year ago and gave this place 5 stars. I took a star away because lately everytime I go, the coffee seems watered down and lacking the same flavor that it used to have. This problem really only happens when the newer employees make the coffee. When the owners are in the store the quality does get better. Today was probably the worst coffee I have gotten from here (still a lot better than Starbucks or homemade though). The coffee tasted like water with essence of coffee even though I got 3 shots of espresso. Hopefully the quality increases as the employees get a bit more experience.</Text>

Great place to stop off for delicious coffee. Their regular black brew is good but don't pass up a chance to try one of their unique flavored lattes! They also offer an assortment of snacks and breakfast items.<//Text>

<userid>104231928705415381213<//userid><Text>The Liquid Leaf is one of my favorite coffee shops! I have frequented this spot any time I am in the area since it first opened, and it has only gotten better and better!

Their scones and tea are very authentic, this is one of the only shops around that I can find real, quality loose leaf tea at. We buy it and bring it home each week, it's every bit as great home brewed as in store.

The owner Ms. Jane is a sweetheart and has always made me feel like a valued guest in her business. All of the baristas are very friendly and helpful, and the seasoned employees are experts!

Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys quality coffee and tea!</Text><pics>None<//pics><Rating>5< /Rating>< name>

The line was quite long, but I'm glad we waited. The hot chocolate was one of the best I've tried. It was rich, chocolate decadence without being too sweet. My husband ordered the pricey siphon bar coffee, which was delicate and delicious. The siphon bar brewing, complete with flames, made for quite a show as they made his pot to order.</Review>

I love this place. The pressed coffee is amazing. The employees and owner are always very kind. It's a must try if you're passing by and a regular stop if you live here.< /review>

<Text>Yumcha is supposed to be crowded and noisy! This place is packed and unfortunately hard to contact on the phone in the morning. It’s full of families and friends both Asian and others which shows the appeal of yumcha in Australia these days. The lack of English of some waiters just lends to the authenticity of the restaurant! We come here when we crave yumcha.<//Text><Name>Martin Spencer< /Name><response>None<//response><Time>1549900260455</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x80db7e77ddd25669:0xf8a94cf67991c658< /GmapID>< userid>

<Review>Delicious tea! Great staff! Tasty pastries!

Love this tea house! It has a very friendly, inviting atmosphere, the teas are wonderful (the chocolate chai latte is one of my favorites!), and the people are so nice!

This is my favorite place to get a hot drink in the cold, and when it gets warm I'll be coming for the iced lattes and blended smoothies!

I love that they are health concious, their drinks aren't overly sugary so you can make it sweeter if you like. They also have alternative milks (soy, almond, I think they had others but I don't remember which ones they are)...

Also, their tea cups are so adorable!</Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<review>I don't get to come here as often as I'd like because of where I live, but it is such a treat when I do. Today I tired the blended banana Chai with an add shot. Made with homemade spiced chai! It is sooo good! The drinks and food are just as wonderful as the staff. Jane, the founder, owner, manager, designer, has done such an amazing job of creating an inviting and beautiful environment. In fact, I found out that she fabricated much of the decor herself. I highly recommend visiting this clean and spacious coffee shop and trying the taste of truly hand crafted tea, coffee and smoothies! Next, I'd like to explore the breakfast sandwiches and wraps... Yuummmmm!</review></record>

One-of-a-kind store in DTLA Arts District. Lots of pop-up shops featuring trendy art, accessories, apparel, etc. I was pleasantly surprised by the moderate price points - for example, several framed pieces of art were under $200.

Clothing and accessories were mostly for women. Definitely worth visiting if you’re in the neighborhood. Lots of people just stop by for the Instagram shot, but it’s well worth going in.</text>

<text>Nice shop in the Arts District. I think it's a strange choice to not allow photos inside, but whatever. Some people have commented on items being overpriced but I think there were a lot of fairly priced, unique items.  The people working there were friendly and there were a lot of nice pillows, sunglasses and t-shirts that were actually on the cheaper side (price-wise, not quality-wise). Worth a stop if you're in the area.<//text>< GmapID>

I found what I thought was some very unique earrings, until I found them for sale on Amazon for 6 pairs for $9.95. My one pair was $20. Not so handmade after all, what a scam. Maybe I just expect people to have a conscious and not call themselves an artist, when all they did was go shopping on Amazon.</Text>< Pics>

Some very interesting small shops in there but quite a few things were made in China which was slightly disappointing. I recommend checking out the other shops next door for handmade items made in the USA.< /text>

My experience exceeded my expectations! The staff was helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about the facility. They made it easy for me to set everything up online. It was easy to access and even had carts by the entrance. I would highly recommend if looking for a storage facility.< /review>

I had no problems with this place until the night of May 31-June 1. They were broken into by multiple looters. Many units were ransacked and items were taken. Walls were broken connecting to others and it looked like it was easy for the thieves to get where they wanted to. My beer is I wasn't notified until mid morning of June 2nd. I don't understand why it took so long. After questions to management I found out their security system and oversight by employees needs a lot of improvement.<//text>

It was a clean and safe unit. However, they do not warn you when they raise your monthly rental costs. We only recently found out when we checked our bank accounts. We went from paying $73 a month to $120 these past few months. It would be helpful if they notified you 6 months ahead like the original manager stated when we got our unit. Never happened. Be prepared for the same when you rent out a unit here.</Text>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience at the Extra Storage Space in Cypress. The Store Mgr Glodean was very helpful and knowledgeable. The access to my storage was fairly easy. Plus, the facility was nice looking and clean. It looked so much better then the other facilities I visited in the area that same day. Very happy! : )</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I'm very impressed! After reserving a unit online I received a call from the Manager who invited me to visit that afternoon to ensure the site and the size of the unit would be suitable. I was shown my unit and we went over the details of the terms and conditions. As it was the last unit of this size I went ahead with the unit rental there and then. Everything was dealt with in a quick and professional manner and the staff could not have been more helpful.<//review>

This was such a wonderful experience! Nice large units at a great price! Very comfortable area. Staff is wonderful and not pushy at all. They want to get you into what fits your needs. Glodean was absolutely amazing through the whole process.

I recommend this to anyone reading this review.</review>

Checked on line got an excellent deal, made reservations to look before renting,  got there, very friendly service, got ready to look at space and was informed the lift was not working only accessible by stairs,  not good when your storing large appliances,  was not offered a ground level one at the advertised special rate to compensate, could not take this unit. Went on line and read reviews, one person left a review in October  ( this was now Nov) saying it had been broken for months and was unable to remove his things. Needless to say some other well known  storage place got my three months cash rent,  nor at the the same rate, but the lift worked every time we went.<//review>

Super helpful. Showed me all sorts of units with no pressure. Very secure. Answered all my questions and was super friendly which was the best. First time using a storage unit so I was a little unsure until Glodean helped me out so well! :)< /Review>

<text>This is my first time needing storage space and wasn't sure what to expect. I just know I wanted it to be clean and safe. This place is both. I initially reserved a basic unit and was sold on the climate controlled unit. The building is new and amazing. So cool and clean. Glodean gets 10 stars. She showed me exactly what I asked for and made recommendations based on my needs. The paperwork was simple and she exains EVERYTHING...Talk about patience and being professional.   Next day I made a change  and rented another unit and she didn't flinch. She got right on it and 20 minutes later I was done...
I feel completely confident with this facility.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x80dd2c26f800d153:0x63163eeb26f3c289< /gmap_id><UserId.>110951700017091521754<//UserId.><Rating>5</Rating><name>lizette reyes< /name></record></dataset><record>

I would sincerely appreciate it if Extra Space Storage upper management will acknowledge Ehtishan Raja’s effort in making sure that customers are being appreciated when they choose Extra Space Storage vs the other storage companies.

Shan has a positive attitude and has the ability to make things possible (that is a first for a GM of Extra Space Storage basing from my personal experience and I had been a client for more than a decade.)

The competition in the storage industry is stiff but I truly believe that having a General Manager like Shan  in your team will be a big help in retaining clients and gaining new customers.</review>

I searched around and they had the best rates better than public storage so I pulled my stuff out and put it to put into their storage the facilities and save me over $200 and a were Way cleaner very nice and maintain and their staff is most notable there very friendly and I enjoyed talking with them every time I go to my storage it's too bad more businesses don't hire people like Goldean and Steve They really make you feel at home there are extremely friendly and polite exemplify the term customer service and I would recommend Extra Space Storage to any of my friends or anyone looking for a place to store there belongings is very nice to know your things are safe and then a very clean environment.<//Text>

<review>I needed a storage space last minute and Steve was able to help us out right away.  The customer service was great; both Glodean and Steve were very friendly.  Steve showed us several options and helped us pick a space that was right for us.   The facilities were very clean and looked secure.

<text>I needed a storage space last minute and Steve was able to help us out right away.  The customer service was great; both Glodean and Steve were very friendly.  Steve showed us several options and helped us pick a space that was right for us.   The facilities were very clean and looked secure.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a space.< /text><gmapID>0x80dd2c26f800d153:0x63163eeb26f3c289</gmapID>< rate>

This storage is managed by the most efficient, personable, and considerate manager Glodean. Since I came in here 2010, she has been welcoming, courteous, and friendly. She is the reason I remained here even though I had reasons to move elsewhere in Corona. In case of need, I would move right back here.

The elevator hasn't worked in 4 months. Everytime I ask about it, they lie to my face. "Oh, I really thought it would be fixed last Friday. It will be fixed by this Friday for sure."

Ok, so the elevator is fixed now. It only took 7 months of frustration, dragging things up and down the stairs and listening to their lies.</Review>

08/27/16 called from the hg facility to make sure they were going to be open, as soon as I walked in shawn & the black lady that worked there gave each other this weird look, l asked about the pricing & they quoted a rate higher than what I was told on the phone & when I asked to see the unit inside they didnt want to show it to me, ive also been told by other facilities that if im storing my insured vehichle i dont need to carty insurance they said that wasnt the case that i had to buy their insurance & that i needed the vehichle registration present as well, it was about 5:15 & the facility closes at 5:30 I can tell by their demeanor & short answers that they were in a rush to close & made me feel unwelcome their, so Im sitting outside of their office writing this review to let u both know your service sucked & you both can eat a fat one, I hope corporate notes that I was quaoted differe t rates in person than what I was told over the phone.<//review>

<Review>This was my toddler's first time visiting a dentist. She had been looking forward to going in and had such a positive experience. Our hygienist and assistant were incredibly friendly and professional, and overall had a great sense of how to speak to and encourage a two year old. I cannot praise the dentist enough. She was sweet, gentle, and simply did her best to make our little family feel comfortable and welcomed. Our little lady left with a sparkling smile and a very happy spirit! p.s. she got to pick a toy, which totally sweetened the deal 🥰</Review><Response>{'time': 1630341897321, 'text': "It brings a smile to all of the staff's faces to read this!

This is the only Dental office I have taken my 10 yr old. He now has braces and it was the best price! They reason for the 3 stars is because the wait time has gotten ridiculous! It use to be in and out with in an hour even for cavity removal. Now this is the 4th time the wait time is unreasonable! Appointment 9:30 …. 11am and they just started to work on him 30 seconds ago. Don’t over book!!! If they wait times does not improve by the time my sons braces are out I’m moving on.</text>

<Review>First time here and I was thrilled! I took my 4.5 year old daughter for her first ever dentist appointment, and everything was great. Although it’s quite busy there, the staff is very attentive and mindful of your needs. Daniel, the dental hygienist and Dr. Shiva, the dentist were awesome! My daughter felt very comfortable and even wanted to stay longer!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Staff was very nice and environment friendly. However, may not be well suited for a 2 year old. Endless medical forms to fill out for a child who is just starting out and doesn’t have any conditions. Also the dentist did not have a good rapport with my 2 year old. They didn’t have any better solutions than holding her down to look in her mouth! Could have a bit more informal and warm approach.

Update:
They contacted me and setup a free return visit with another doctor. The second dentist was much better interacting with younger children at about 2 or 3 years old. Make sure to get Dr. Assal if you child is under 4 or 5. Will continue to visit this office.</text>

Great experience, my 1 year old loved the environment, cartoons everywhere and a fish tank! Dr. Rodef and bud team are so amazing with kids, I’m happy I came here and will continue to do so. Also important to note, I am a dentist myself.< /text>

Their flipper looked quality and more authentic as compared to others I’ve seen. The dentist was very patient, thorough and informative. The staff were very warm and accommodating. My daughter even got some fun toys to send her on her way.

<review>I’ve been bringing my daughter to this office for over 2 years.  My daughter had an appointment today and I was so pleased! Staff and dentist are very nice and helpful. My daughter was not scared and left happy with her toy.

Oh! Also we don’t use fluoride toothpaste and when I mentioned it to them they offered if I wanted a fluoride free toothpaste! How nice!!</review>< user_name>

It was my daughter's first dental visit here and overall it was great. Due to covid my baby hasn't been out in public(mainly around people) much so she cried when they examined her. They showed us a technique how to brush her teeth better, because it's battle with a toddler. Grateful for that, because now we can brush her teeth really good! In the end they gave her a stuffed animal. My daughter is in love with that stuffed toy!! THANK YOU!!!</Text>

She made  me wait more than an hour   to see the dentist for my son! Whenever I asked her whether I am missing my spot  waiting for long doesn’t make sense, she kept telling me I will be next while people coming after me are treated accordingly.  I come 30 min early and told her from the beginning,  even if I am outside to call me so she took our name.  I am upset i waited more than an hour from our appointment time. Because of that we have to it in a crowd during covid for long. Also it doesn’t bother her what I am going through asking her twice  no apologies or nothing( I don’t know if she even consider as a customer) I feel like we were forgotten and nobody cares until I went to the front desk and complain!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>My mom, my sister and myself felt discriminated today.  When we got  the office,  we were asked to wait outside with a few other Hispanic families.  When we finally were able to go inside we witness the office getting full and two male dads came in and the front door person who told us to wait outside allowed them both to wait inside.  The only reason because they were white and we are Hispanic.  Of all the years we have been coming to your office,  this was the worse day ever,  my mom was very sad to see how this other Hispanic lady and child were still kept outside where it’s was very cold.  I felt very sad. The doctors are always nice to both my sister and me.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1618425512841, 'text': 'When we fall short we are deeply sorry and want to make things right.

The whole team at Children's Dental Fun Zone were a breath of fresh air everyone was friendly and even though you could not see the smile on their faces over their masks you can tell they were doing just that with their eyes.  It was my sons first time at the dentist and he was super scared and crying, Dr Shamsian was patient and super cool. Xrays proved to be another ordeal....in come Karla and Chandler and with all of their clear know how before I knew it they had him sitting on the x-ray chair and allowed them to take pictures!  Overall our experience was an excellent one in spite of the circumstances.  I would undoubtedly recommend this office to any family and friends.</Text>< pics>

I shared with the staff that my son is very sensitive to noise and touch.  The young man who took my son’s X-rays did an excellent job. He kept him engaged in conversation to distract him from the discomfort.  The dental hygienist, Saul, was so kind.  He took extra time and did everything he could to help my son get a cleaning despite my son’s complaints.  He even gave him a toy.  The dentist was also kind and tried his best.</Text>

My son was a bit scared to go to the dentist for the first time. He had heard "stories" from classmates that had frightened him. A family friend recommended Children's Dental FunZone.

The moment that we walked into the office, we knew that we had made the right choice. The space was clean, colorful, and inviting. From the very beginning, the staff was warm and helpful. I mentioned my child's apprehension and they took extra care to make him feel at ease. They joked around and soon there were smiles for all of us. The dentist was super kind and informative.

To sum up, there were movies and games in the waiting area, a chosen movie during treatment, amazingly sensitive staff, and the whole process was fast. Plus, a prize at the end! We're actually looking forward to our next visit. Highly recommend.</Review>

< Review>
Staff was friendly and had pleasant dispositions. They were patient with my son who is scared of the dentist visits.  Staff took there time with cleaning and talked to my son throughout the whole process even making him laugh. My son left happy and I can tell he is more comfortable with dentist visits. I am definitely changing Dental Fun Zone West LA to my sons main dentist.<//Review>

Wow! What an awesome experience. Unlike any we have ever had in the past. Our dentist was so kind and gentle and helped my daughter stay calm (she has a huge fear) I can’t rave enough about our visit. And we both look forward to the next appointment. Such a change from the usual, unpleasant previous pediatric dentist.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>This Dental office comes highly recommended. My daughter has been coming here for over 2 years and loves it. The staff gets you in and out in a reasonable amount of time. The best part is that you don’t get cheated with face-to-face time with the dentist. They always walk my daughter step-by-step from X-ray, to the chair, through the cleaning. The Dr makes child friendly conversation. What makes this place super special and I’ll never forget this. On one of our first visits, Dr.Y had a high-school student shadowing him and he told my daughter maybe when she’s old enough she could do the same. For a child of color to hear those words at such a young age expands possibilities. Dr. Y is the most gentle, soft spoken, but knowledge pediatric dentist in LA with a heart of gold. He gives his patients his undivided attention and it never seems rushed despite having so much going on in the room. I have recommended friends there and they always come back converted. Oh and the kids always get great incentives whether it be a small party favor, no cavities certificate/ Shakey’s coupon (which my daughter loves), or swag. Give this place a try especially if you have child like mines who can be super suspicious of medical professionals. All my experiences have been beyond my expectations.

Also in the age of coronavirus, they have taken precautions to keep distance between patients in the waiting room, visible ongoing disinfecting of surfaces, no exchange of paperwork (all electronic), and they have removed all the play tables/ toys.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I really like this place. The front desk staff are courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. The dental assistants from X-ray to cleaning teeth have been thorough and genuinely kind to my 5 year old boys. The dentist is great. She is gentle and thoroughly explains her process and findings.  My boys ask me when are we going back to the dentist, because they want to go back. For the boys it could be a combination of the friendly environment and little gifts they get after their visit with the dentist.

Unfortunately we changed our insurance to a plan they don’t accept. However, once we can go back to them, we will!</review><resp>{'time': 1563404863501, 'text': "Thank you for your rating.

Love this dentist! It’s clean, fun, and we didn’t wait long. Our two year old loved it here in the “Fun Zone” and everyone was so kind. They gave him toys for being a patient too. Great place!</review>

This dentist is absolutely wonderful! We recently lost coverage on our dental and my daughter needed a checkup and cleaning. This place was the most affordable! I have been coming here since my daughter started seeing a dentist and I will continue to come just because the staff alone. The price just makes it that much better.
Highly recommend bringing your kids here, they are amazing</Review>

I’ve been going here for a little over a year now, I wished I would of known about this place sooner. The people that work there from the dentist to the front desk always make it a great experience for my son. He has anxiety but ever since Ive been going here he isn’t scared to go and always looks forward to chatting it up with them. If I could I’d give them 10 stars.< /text>

<Text>This dental office is the best for children! The decor is child friendly. They offer complimentary toys which the children can choose if they like. The doctors are great with children, who tend to be fearful, or fussy. In most cases your out in an hour. I love it there and you can schedule on Sundays which works great if you have kids that have Saturday classes, or recreational obligations. Works perfect for me and I highly recommend Dental Fun Zone for all my grandsons dental needs!</Text>< pictures>

They are very friendly and sweet to all the children. My two kids have had plenty of dental work done at this location and all very successful. They have had fillings, extractions and have orthodontist in the same location. My kids love going to the dentist! I look forward referring my family and friends to bring their kids here. Love them!!<//text>

I had trouble keeping a steady dentist for my child, since so many places want you out the room when certain procedures are done. When I heard about children's dental fun zone I immediately inquired and became a proud parent of a patient. The doctors are amazing and sinister the staff, they are very flexible and accept Medi-Cal. Thanks doctors and staff! They are a truly amazing pediatric dentistry.🤟🤩🥰<//Text>

The Dr is patient, kind and was very through. Asked about a tongue tie, food allergies and addressed issues about my child as a whole, not just teeth. The exam was done in a gentile way making sure both my kids were comfortable and talking them through everything he was doing. We were late to our appointment but made accommodations for us. We are thankful for having the office so local and professional.<//text>

Incompetent staff! Dentists and Orthodontists so busy because they're seeing so many clients that they don't know up from down. They lost my daughter's medical records. They had another child's records in my daughter's chart. When I was terminating services and asked for my daughter's records, they actually printed out and gave me another child's records! Which is completely illegal, a violation of HIPPA, and makes me believe they're unaware of the proper way to take care of medical records. Additionally, when I terminated services, I had to pay in full my balance, which I did. Even though the services were not completed.The following day I got an additional charge to my credit card, which was not authorized at all! So now they're using my credit card at their own discretion, giving other patients medical records out, and on top of it, the appointment times and wait times are absolutely egregious. If I could give negative stars, I would.< /review>

I dont have any issue with this form my only concern is that i was told that i can't bring my husband in because this office is limiting the amount of adults going inside.so My husband left me with my 2 kids.and once i went inside for my kids preop,while waiting for the tech and dentist.once patient with 2 adults are with her.i mean if you guys will try to impose rules please do you use according to what you guys inform other patients.its not fair that we would get a different treatment from other patient.i have 2 kids and im alone were this other patient
Have 2 adults with her.i don't know what your reason is because the time i would want to speak to your manager she's no were in the office.and people don't seem to care when i told my concern.if your so concern also with the people going in and out of your office.you might have to also check the amount of patients your seeing.because when we came ur office was pack.whoever is doing the schedule should put a gap in each hour so it would not be a chaos like that just now.theres no even any chairs to sit on.and inform your patients parents that you have such rules.good job btw with doctors and tech.but your schedule and how you treat my husband is bad.be fair.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This place is horrible!! They have multiple problems that they need to fix. One they need to take the time to help children with special needs. They are very impatient and want to get you out the door. They refused to see my son after I got his doctor to medically clear him for treatment. They also told me that my son had five cavities. They never did any of his X-rays correctly. When I took him to another dentist the doctor informed me that he has multiple cavities and now needs four crowns due to the fact that they did not treat him in a timely matter. This dentist office needed to get more professional doctors that have been trained with better patient/ customer relationship. They are horrible I am deciding to take my other two children away from here due to the lack of professional treatment, honesty, and knowledge of dental care. I really wish they would be like they were when they first opened!! If anyone else has had a bad experience with this place I highly suggest you go to Kids Dental Kare where the dentist are professional and take the time to actually look at your child and tell you the TRUTH!!!< /Text>

<text>I have a family of 5 kids I scheduled this appointment 6 months ago without realizing it was a holiday and kids were out when I walked in I saw they were super busy came in at 1050am and i was done with all 5 by 12 it was amazing my oldest had a cavity which they were able to get him same day he said doctor was nice but the only thing he didnt like was that they were having personal conversation in front of him of them going out the day prior and other things he said he felt awkward but nothing disrespectful I still give a 5 star because they are great.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>They gave me wrong information regarding my daughter’s treatment for 2 months, finally schedule her appointment on a Sunday. They changed the appointment time 3 times but forgot to notify me and on the day of the appointment they put somebody else before us without notification which cause us to wait for over an hour in the office. Terrible communication skills.</review></record>

Here at Children's Dental FunZone we work very hard to maintain minimal wait times through-out the year.

The wait is always terrible.  8:30 am appointment not seen by the doctor until 45 minutes later.  Why so consistently late, even so early in the morning?  Doctor was rushed but did hang back to answer my questions while when I asked them as he stood to make his way out.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><pics>None< /pics><Text>I love this team. From the receptionist to the doctors they are all professional, friendly, and extremely personable. They value your time and you don't wait long for your appointment. They take their time and they don't rush the child to make sure the child is comfortable and make sure all my questions are answered. I even had to go to drop off a piece of paper from a referred oral surgeon and the dentist took time to sit down and talk to me. It's that type of service that will keep me coming back here until they tell me my kids are too old. 🤣😀 Thank you Dentist team and Ortho team...<//Text>< response>

<Review>I'm very disappointed of this clinic they are are all time in a hurry specially the doctor, many times they are very rude with kids and they think we the parents don't know, I did pay for the whole treatment but they still asking for money every time I come and they hold the files  for more time than they need and don't let the patient get in so money is more important than patients? Please if you are reading this look for other place, this place looks nice but at the end is the worst, the orthodontist has no modals 30bor 40 seconds with each patient there is no time for questions and if they do something wrong they blame the patient,  no moral,  rudeness and overfilled  wants more?</Review>< rate>

Rarely do I go out of my way to write a review, but this place is so good that they deserve the recognition. My boys had the best dental experience with Dr. Asal, she is truly the epitome of what a great pediatric dentist is! She is friendly, patient, gentle and incredibly skilled and good at what she does. She has a way of putting my kids at ease during treatment which is also so comforting for me as a parent. I fully trust her and appreciate that she takes a more conservative approach to treating my kids' dental needs. Major plus that they have a movie playing to distract my kids during treatment. I wish this place was around when i was a kid!<//Review>

I took my 2 daughters a 7yr old and 3 yr old they treated them with so much patience and care. My 7yr old has a lot of previous dental work and suffers from panic when going to the dentist due to her previous dental office ,both the doctor and staff helped ease her anxiety.Saul was so good with her now she's less fearful of the dentist. And the Dr was great at showing me her xrays and explaining her concerns and plans for treatment.</Text>

Highly recommend this place!! My 6 year old had to have a lot of work and preventative treatment for his weak enamel. Great office staff and doctors made the whole experience  great smooth and easy. Talked us through each step, let my son pick his movie to watch, scent for gas, even had blankets to make the saftey restraints more cozy and not scary.< /Review>

The wait is always terrible.  8:30 am appointment not seen by the doctor until 45 minutes later.  Why so consistently late, even so early in the morning?  Doctor was rushed but did hang back to answer my questions while when I asked them as he stood to make his way out.< /Text>

Unfortunately appointments that are made during vacation times (i.e., times when the majority of students are off from school) often are our busiest, such as spring break. We are very proud of our doctors taking time to speak with patients and their parents, and always answering any questions that they may have."}<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>Highy reccomend! It was my daughters first time going to  the dentist and she was a bit difficult but everyone was no nice and patient. So much to entertain the kids while they wait and after their appt. They get to pick a prize! Children's dental funzone was recommended by my cousin and I'm so glad I listened.  We took our girls together and they even let them sit next to each during their visit. I love how they go out of their way to make the kids comfortable.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I started bringing my boys to Children's Dental FunZone when they were two and a half. They are now four and a half and have loved each visit. The dental hygienists are very gentle and great with kids. The dentists are very nice and knowledgeable. We have never had trouble with the X-rays. My boys really love the waiting room with movies, iPads and toys. Of course they absolutely love getting free toys every time (doesn't hurt getting them to go, at all). It's a great motivator at this age. They think going to the dentist is fun! They have never resisted or complained about going, which is great.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Date>

The office manager ran my credit for $6,000  in dental work. I did "not" authorize her to run my credit application for that amount. My dental work would only run me $2,500 at the most. She also refused to provide my 4 year old son with a dental referral to Children's Dental Hospital. I had to call the owner and let him know I'd be filing a lawsuit if their office does not provide care and service. I will still need to remove or appeal the negative rejection on my report. This office is subject to mismanagement and over billing/charging. Although the place was clean and the dentist was really helpful. The Manager seemed a bit discriminatory, this place will rip you off when it's time to apply for dental credit.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Dr. Yaghoubi is my go too daughter’s dentist. He is USC trained and educated. He will give you an honest opinion and has great bed side manners. Though it’s a busy place, I would say do not schedule a Sunday appointment it’s a zoo in there. Front office staff Yasmin always has a smile when helping out and scheduling, they are very accommodating. Owner Dr. Roloff treated my daughter with a dental emergency with results that super exceeded my expectations. Kaley one of the dental assistant’s is great at calming on my fidgety child’s nerves.</Text>< pictures>

<time>1437892182379< /time><rate>5<//rate><Text>I can not tell you how happy I am that this is where we take our kids. The staff in front are super friendly. The atmosphere is great - the kids love the aquarium, the child friendly movies and the ipad games. But most of all, I was taken aback by the honesty and integrity of the doctors that work there. One of my kids were seen with Dr. Rodef and the other by Dr. Razi. They are both super honest and caring doctors who took the time to answer all of my questions and seriously treated my kids like their own. Dr. Razi has kids of her own so she really knows how to make the conversation kid friendly. She showed my little one that she was only counting his teeth, she explained every process, she got him to cooperate by telling him that he is her little helper. He had a great time opening like a dinosaur. Overall, the experience was so pleasant that I would really not take my kids anywhere else.<//Text>< Pics>

All that matters to me is how my 9 year old  daughter felt during our visit, she was super comfortable and was cared for the entire time. I was there the whole time they were working on her teeth and could see how caring all the girls were (there were men too but our experience was only with the girls) thank you thank you to this entire team, thank you for not traumatizing my daughter and making her feel safe. I appreciate you all!!!<//review>

(Translated by Google) Unfortunately I got there because they sent my family dentist ... but I had a very bad experience a few days ago I got there to take my daughter to an appointment and the Dr. During the treatment I yelled at me which I did not think and I got up from the chair and put a stop to her 🛑 I told her that if in my house 🏠 I do not yell at my daughter because I am going to let a dental office yell at her so even though she apologized, I think that she is not qualified to be with Children what I saw that she despaired very quickly ... Unfortunately they sent me there to finish a treatment But the truth is I would not recommend anyone there 👎🏻 ..

(Original)
Desafortunadamente yo llegue ahi por que mandaron de mi dentista familiar .. pero tuve una muy mala experiencia hace unos dias llegue ahi a llevar a mi hija a una cita y la Dra. Durante el Tratamiento me le grito lo cual no me parecio y me levante de la silla y le puse un Alto 🛑 le dije que si en mi Casa 🏠 yo no le grito a mi hija por que boy a dejar que un Consultorio Dental le griten asi que aunke ella se disculpo pienso que ella no esta Capacitada para estar con niños lo que yo vi que ella se desespero muy rapido ... Desafortunadamente me mandaron ahi para terminar un tratamineto Pero la verdad No recomendaria a Nadie ahi 👎🏻..<//Text>
