<review>Parking lot is small and complicated, with senior drivers that dont know right vs left. The produce section is the worst! Most things are either rotten or empty. Staff is nice. Clearance section is not worthwhile. I’d rather go to the one off Topanga/ ventura. This ralphs is just outdated<//review>< pics>

<user_name>Vihaari D<//user_name><Date>1511762866584<//Date><Text>Nice and friendly place. Customer service is good. Neatly maintained. Once I bought 3 coconuts  and 2 of them were rotten, I got money refund. Only thing they need to improve is to keep fresh strawberries. Mostly I see rotten berries in each box. Everything else is good.  Bakery section is very well organized and always you see fresh baked goods. My kids love pies, donuts,croissants and cookies.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I try to make my outings to run errands few. It has been incredibly challenging during the Covid epidemic for me with unkind words and refusal of entry or service.

<Review>Very friendly Ralph's location. The employees are great and always willing to help a shopper. Customers are polite to one another and the store has nice, wide aisles to use a cart. The selection of international and health foods is perfect. A nice place to purchase groceries.</Review></record>

Over the years this store has turned into a "Do it yourself" kind of place when it comes to bagging groceries. It's reached a point where if there's an employee around to do the bagging I feel like I've been given something rare like a winning lottery ticket. If they're that hung up on being understaffed to save money then they should fire the store managers. I've never once seen a manager step in and bag groceries.

I advise shopping elsewhere.< /text>

While this Ralph's is the larger of the two in the area, it is always packed, both in the parking lot and at the registers. Speaking of which: it's a shame they feel the need to cut back on employees and rely on self-checkout. Very dystopic. Local, community business should support the community they serve and employ people..not dispense with them in favor of machines.<//text>

We usually do our grocery shopping here, never a problem. The only negative encounter we have had here was with the older latino man that works in produce, he always gives us the stink eye and has answered us rudely when we asked a question, I guess he has a problem with people of his own race because he always seems cheery when speaking with non-latino people, what a coconut!</Text>

<Review>Strange night last night we went in shopping like we always do on Sundays and spent about $450 a little high for a normal weekly shopping. Had an item that was supposed to be returned but didn't get so so after checking out I checked with the manager to see about getting the returned and he told me to wait in line again and have them rering it. We had ice cream and ice already in our shopping carts and he made me wait in line again on multiple customers to have it rerun his name is Jeff and he's got to be the worst customer service rep for Ralphs I've ever seen</Review><user_name>Del Panzarini< /user_name>< Rate>

Check your receipt! I got intentionally overcharge .99 cent of a "grocery fs" of something I didn't bought as I stood there wondering what that was for. I googled this store and it seems like they have been doing this for sometime. Imagine all the overcharge they been collecting. Pretty sneaky, since we dont get taxed on food....I also called to ask about what this charge was and they were saying it was a price check...We didnt even do a price check and then they wanted to say all that for a dollar...ahh..yes....I will shop elsewhere and stay away from this location...</review>

<text>I had gone to Ralph's on 3/17/2019 . I purchased some hot foods. And I requested $120 from my account. I was talking to the cashier. I asked her if she knew how much a Costco yearly membership cost? She charged my order and I left the store. I went home, ate what I bought. I took a hours nap. I ended up going to Walmart to buy a car vacuum. I noticed my wallet was empty. And I wondered where I put the $120 I took out of my account at Ralph's? I notified the Ralph's manager and she nicely said to call the next day around 7 am . She said ask for Brittini who is the book keeper. I called for Brittini, and Brittini was super nice & sweet. She was payroll at the moment. She said she would help me when she was done. I told her to take her time. She called me an hour later. I gave her my details and explained if she can find the $120 in one of the cashiers cash boxes? Brittini said she would need to use the store cameras to help in the search. Brittini called me back a couple hours later. Brittini told me she found the money. The cashier never gave it to me. And I could come pick it up anytime at the. She would leave it in the front desk. Thanks to Brittini I didn't lose anything. It was also my fault for not paying attention the previous day! I would gladly buy Brittini coffee & doughnuts if she likes! She has my contact number.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This has been my favorite Ralph's for years, but I will NEVER AGAIN return to the STARBUCKS inside of it. The workers there are RUDE and do not care about customer service. I ordered my drink with their worker Natasha and she gave me PURE attitude when I wanted to confirm that my drink had no sugar in it. I was making sure because I am a TYPE 1 DIABETIC and have had serious issues with this kind of mistake in the past. She practically rolled her eyes at me! Not to mention that while I was waiting, all she could do was GOSSIP about her fellow employees, not a very nice girl and not a very nice establishment.<//review>< Pics>

Average store, seemingly miserable staff. Was there a few nights ago after work at about 12:45am, they had already turned the auto doors off. Someone tried to come in wanting one thing, security guard literally told him to "get lost" and one of the cashier's said "if you're hungry, Jack In The Box is open" over the loudspeaker 3 people in line left their groceries and walked out. That was extremely uncalled for especially after closing 15 minutes early. I would avoid this store if I were you< /Text>

<Text>I stopped by on the way home to get some pizza for dinner. There was no line so I was hoping it would be quick since it was late and I was hungry. They got right on it and the pizza was dine quick. We really enjoyed the pizza it was hot and fresh and tasted great. It's been a while since I've eaten here. Will definitely come back soon.</Text>< Pics>

Food is GOOD, always fresh and hot, and they offer 'special deals' quite frequently. I just cashed in on a 'Large stuffed crust pizza with one topping' deal for $12.00 - fantastic pizza at a fantastic value!!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻< /Review>

I specifically paid for my tip to the driver during ordering to avoid this. I asked the employee over the phone to please have the driver place the pizzas on the table I keep on my porch. I have chairs and all sorts of surfaces for her to place everything I ordered on. She rang the doorbell several times and proceeded  to hand my son every item. I asked her to please leave everything on the table and she did not listen. I will not order from this location again. As it is, I don’t order food or dine out much because of this pandemic. Very irresponsible of this delivery driver.<//Review>

<Text>This place south street in Lakewood had no prices to view you order and then get bent over.  so I asked how much was a x- large veggie  pizza was they said $17.40. Came out to $21.30 go figure cancelled order. It would be nice to know the price before ordering. Do not go, hopefully other papa jhons are better and have menus.< /Text>< Pics>

Last night's pizza was just thrown together both of them. The sauce was raw. Sauce tasted stale and old. Not fresh like in the past. The worst ever from this location. The quality wasn't there.They don't make pizza like in the 60s or 70s anymore. They just toss it together and out the door. Shame on you Papa John!!!<//text>

Okay, so o haven't had this place in forever, and. Not really into Pinapple on pizzas. However, their Chicken Bacon pizza with Pinapple on it was so dang delicious. I really really recommend trying it. Even if it's only once. Legit. It was truly good. Do it lol. Also, very friendly and fast as heck<//text>

Told us our order would be ready in 20 min. 20 min came and they still haven't made our pizza's. Employee said hes the only one working. Maybe they should hire more people at night or have everyone learn how to make pizza.< /review>

<Review>This review is on their customer service. I walked in and one guy is standing towards the back eating and having a conversation with a guy preparing food next to him. Neither of them said hello or even acknowledged i was there.. Then another guy came from the office and asked if I was going to order or puck up. I said pickup and that i wanted to add an order of breadsticks and he just put my pizza on the counter and walked away. The customer service here is horrible. Maybe they are better when you order for delivery but i won't be coming here again<//Review>< pics>

Bad service and pricey, yes $20 for large. I would always  get a carry out at Long beach location for 1/2 half price. I just moved to Lakewood.  Not sure if this franchise location is honoring the deals.< /text>

Becareful of this place the price is always changing.  Some of the employees are crooks.  I always order the same pizza and every time the price changes.  They play you for idoits and probably pocket the money for themselves​.</Text>

<Review>First and last time here. The food tasted just fine until I found HAIR in my food. I know it wasn’t mine because I dug it up from the inside of my bowl. I also noticed the girl working there had long hair and it was loosely tied, most of it was down so I assumed it was hers. I immediately took it back to the store and got a refund. This place is a bit too pricey for their mediocre quality anyway. Never coming back here.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>Salmon and tuna with half rice and salad. I added close to every topping. The fish taste clean and fresh along with all other topping. Nothing taste old or that it had been sitting there all day. Around $11 good portion for the price.<//Text>< Pictures>

Initially, I let this place pass because of my sushi cravings, because the place i usually get my sushi burritos is in Valencia; but after the last-time I went into Fishbowl Poke to pick up my food, I am never ever going back. First off, I ordered to pick up my food 1 hour and a half before it was even ready. The ordering app kept pushing the time to a later and later readiness time...so I get to the place, and the sign said the place was closed when i clearly saw people walking out with food, so i called the food app in which i ordered, and they said that is lt shows the restaurant was closed. They were about to give me a refund when i told them to wait because i was going to ask inside. So i went in and they are serving a customer who tells me it is closed! So i said: "How can it be closed if i preordered my food an hour ago?" Then, they let me wait inside forever(40 more min). They were really backed up that day, and it was all a big mess! They kept making people leave ssand they were pushing business away as if they had all the clientele in the world, and it wouldn't hurt to lose more.  Furthermore, the worst part is they were so careless because they had their plastic gloves on and off, and they kept touching the screen of their mini tablet as they fixed orders and kept going back to touching food and back and then again, and then the girl that was there kept fixing her pants and lowering her shirt and fixing her bra and chest area, not washing her hands and putting clean gloves on again. Another customer brought that to their attention, and the two guys sort of listened; but the girl didn't care, and continued. That carelessness and grossness is not going into my stomach anymore. That customer told them about cross--contamination and uncleanliness...If someone who inspects their business would have been there, i bet they would have shut them down. That is unnacceptable! Never again.< /Text>

Best Poke place in the valley. There are no limits to toppings, some do cost extra like avocado, but they have a wide selection of toppings and fish. The sauces are the best, the aioli sauce has to be my all time favorite. Service there is quick and friendly. If I am ever around this place, its a struggle for me not to go in and get a bowl, most times I lose that struggle. Highly recommend this place to poke fans everywhere!</review>

Nice place and quite popular, best for take out. Parking is free but close by is always taken. These parking slots are narrow, and the area is always crowded. Food is good, enjoy 👍</Review>

Do not get me wrong. The food is great. But as i was ordering I noticed the employee helping me was visibly agitated. I did not take it the wrong way initially. But the longer the transaction took, the more she seemed to put her frustrations on me.

Everyone has a bad day at work here and there. But its just dissapointing to pay 18 dollars for a bowl of rice and fish to be treated like an inconvenience. Oh well.< /Text>

It was really good. Just kind of pricey. I guess you get what you pay for, but $20 bucks for a bowl. That's a lil too much. No leftovers either. I'd still go again just not anytime soon.</Text>

I had my first Poke bowl experience here! There are many choices for fish and toppings. And the toppings are of great variety. The most exciting thing for me was the choices of sauces. Mixing and matching sauces can make all the difference.</Text>

<text>Girlfriend loves this place, however they are really short on staff. Not sure why, but I never see more than 2 people working at a time. Sometimes only one person!

< Review>
This place is stupid expensive and the portions are crazy small. I wasn't impressed. The fish seemed to be decent quality and the ingredients were fine, so I'll give it an extra star. :/ I don't think that a little bowl and an iced tea should be $20. In comparison, my friend brought poke from Sweetfin and it was the same size bowl for half the price.</Review>

Best Poke anywhere. Plenty of fish to choose from. They have fish you'll never find at any other poke restaurant like Red Snapper. My favorite is the Spicy Tuna and Red Snapper. Yum!!!!🤤😋</review>

Best poke in the valley, bar none. Also, unlike many other places, they allow unlimited toppings!</text>

It was ok. The serving is kinda small on this place compare to the other poke places I've been to. It's like their scoops are really small and the girl that served me was kind of rushing me so I didn't really get to look at what more add ons I want. Price is about the same to other poke places, just the serving is more limited.< /Review>

Love this place. The serving portions are a great value for what youre paying. Only complaint is if you go after 9 the picking for toppings are slim and it seems as if the staff just wants to close and not serve. Definitely have better service during the day.<//review>

Sushi is not my thing so I opted for cooked shrimp. Added jalepenos.  Light and tasty and a satisfying meal.  Pleasant staff too.  Outdoor seating.</Text>

Great place for poke, fresh fish choices, and toppings. Prices are a bit on the high side imo, been to places with similar qualities for less money. Parking is horrible during busy times, its in a plaza with alot of other stores and restaurants.< /review>

<Text>Husband and I accidently found this place on our way to eat sushi. Seriously best find ever!! All the ingredients are super fresh and the burrito is GREAT! We tried the hot Cheeto covered poke burrito and it did not disappoint. Definitely coming again soon but maybe earlier than 9pm, staff seemed a little bummed everytime a new customer walked through the door.</Text>< pictures>

I came in with Bell’s palsy and the doc on duty calmed my nerves since I thought I was getting a stroke. He knew the details and provided me the needed information to be comfortable. The front desk and the entire team are great. Will recommend them to anyone over and over again.

Keep doing an awesome job.</Review>

We got the rapid covid testing today (needed to produce one prior to boarding an international flight), and it was such a VERY pleasant, professional experience from start to finish. Thank you for your service! Special shoutout to nurse Katherine & the attending physician Melanie Martin- they were so kind and so helpful.

***A couple notes: they strongly encourage you to do a VIRTUAL VISIT first especially if you have symptoms. Then they will schedule testing after the virtual visit. If you go this route, the cost is $200 out of pocket/without their network insurance (I have Kaiser, and unfortunately Kaiser is not part of their network, FYI)

In our case, we needed testing immediately because of our time restraint, so we were able to schedule appointment directly online the San Bruno branch for swabbing. This route was $300- expensive but worth it. They’re the only one to test with this technology in Northern California!

If you pay out of pocket, save your receipts because you will most likely be able to reimburse it retroactively with whatever insurance company you have. After getting the receipt, make sure to call their billing department afterwards to have it itemized so the COVID-19 test is line itemed.

Good luck & stay safe. Thank you Dignity Health!<//Review>

Thank you all for fitting me in for my Covid test. I was at the office when they opened.  As I was traveling in from out of state for a medical procedure which notified me last minute that a test was required to have my procedure. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The test was a rapid test and  allowed me to proceed with my procedure. THANK YOU ALL !!!< /Text>

I went there for the COVID test for me to go Hawaii. They were able to help me as soon as they saw me. Really friendly and clear instructions. Told me to wait for 20-25 mins for the result and the Physician Assistant was able to explain what I should do next. Very helpful! I recommend to make an appointment online for fast process!< /Text>

I would not recommend anyone coming here for urgent care.

I came here to get my stitches removed. I made an appointment and showed up on time. There was nobody at the front desk when I arrived. I waited 45 minutes before the doctor saw me. The doctor was friendly, and seemed to have done a good job.

However, about two weeks later I found a small piece of stitch (~⅛ in.) still remaining beneath my newly closed wound. I returned to the place and asked the doctor to remove it. I couldn't believe when he said he couldn't see the remaining stitch. I had three people looking at it before I went back to the center, and they all saw it clearly. The doctor kept stressing that I was concerned due to cosmetic reason, when I never said a word about the potential scar. He said he could cut my wound open again, or I could wait for it to come out itself (medically speaking, this is a rare possibility). Such an unprofessional and irresponsible doctor he was! I left in disbelief.

The same day, I went to a a friend of mine, who is a retired medical professional. It took less than 10 seconds--he sterilized a sharp tweezer, turned on the bright light, and removed the remaining stitch, only breaking a little bit of my skin (like removing a thorn).

I would avoid this center at all cost.< /Text>

I have been there three times for a COVID test prior to surgeries and everyone was wonderful! Friendly, professional, and helpful.  I was seen at my appointment time. You all made it very easy and convenient. I truly appreciate everything you are doing for us during the pandemic!

Excellent caring and customer service all the way around!!</Text>

DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! They DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE.
Ladies at the desk were definitely being discriminant. My mom went in and they said they don’t accept her insurance and to try some other place. I had a different insurance and I made sure it was accepted before I went in. I told the lady my flight is in 3 days and I need to take the PCR Test. The lady at the desk said we accept your insurance but we are not  going to take your test as it will not arrive on time. I went on to telling her that I want to take the test regardless if I do not get the results back on time. I just want to take the test. There were two ladies who both REFUSED to take my test even though I had insurance. They kept making the excuse that my test results won’t come in on time. I told them multiple times that I don’t mind the results coming in later and I just want to take the test, but they kept refusing. I don’t understand why you can’t take my test when my insurance is paying you to take my test?!?
They definitely were discriminating against my mother and I. I don’t understand why they couldn’t just take my test when there are people in the reviews who have gotten their rapid testing done from this place. I will definitely be taking action against them for this.<//text>

<text>Walked in around 4pm on a Thursday (November 5,2020) and was greeted by a rude guy on the front desk. I didn’t had an appointment so i was told to wait outside for 5 minutes. 20 minutes passed by, he’s still sitting on the chair with no updates.

<text>Update on 10/26/20 : Per the business manager's comment, I emailed the email address with the information requested today at 9:34am. Currently awaiting a response/call....

I scheduled appointments for my husband and I to get covid testing on 7/24/20. I fill out all of the registration and insurance information for myself online via a link sent through email as well as text to avoid exchanging of forms in person. An hour before our appointment times, a staff member calls me to let me know they will not be able to perform any testing on us without first having a virtual appointment. She proceeded to cancel both of our appointments, or so I thought.

Fast forward a few weeks later, and I receive a bill in the mail for a blood draw that supposedly occurred on 7/24/20. How am I getting billed for a blood draw when I never even made it to the appointment? On 8/10/20, I called the urgent care office, no one answers the phones and their voicemail box is full. Then I called the billing department to ask how it's possible to get billed when the appointment was cancelled. The billing department sends my file for review to the urgent care office and they tell me someone will reach out to me. Two weeks go by and there is no contact from anyone, so I call the billing department back on 8/24/20. I'm told they are still waiting for the office to review my file and to wait a few more weeks.

I finally call back on 9/16/20 after not hearing anything. They apparently closed the review because they decided I had been at the appointment because they had my insurance information, so that must mean I was there. I explained how I had completed all of the paperwork in advance per the instructions from both the email and the text. Then they tell me well they did order a blood draw but one was not actually done....THEN WHY AM I BEING BILLED FOR IT??? They tell me they will send the file up further for more investigation and it could take up to 3 weeks for a resolution. I ask them to please check their security footage of that date and time to see who it was who walked in to take our appointments. They MUST have some type of security camera in their lobby right??

I call again on 9/23/20 and 9/28/20 after receiving the second bill for a blood draw in the mail. Still no resolution.

Called again on 10/19/20, and they apparently closed my review after having concluded I was definitely there. This is getting so ridiculous. I received another bill in the mail - this time for the actual visit itself. I just don't understand how I can be billed for an appointment I never had, for a blood draw that never occurred??? They tell me they will review again and wait just a little more.

This past week, we just received a bill for my husband that somehow ended up in the correct mailbox despite the incorrect mailing address!! They even billed for covid lab tests that never took place and fabricated lab results!!

What kind of fraudulent billing practices are they trying to pull here? I can't believe they are still trying to fraudulently bill for services never received/performed and tests not done, even going so far as to fabricate lab results/report. Its mind boggling.<//text>< pictures>

I visited the clinic on Feb and paid all the bills (just $200) in June. But in July I got a credit collection service call which told me I still owe money and that may hurt my credit score.  It costs me more 2 hours to figure out some clues.  What a wonderful experience! Hope you got bankrupted soon!< /review>

Staff and care delivered at the clinic was good. Efficient check in process and about as convenient as that part can be.
Billing office however charged my insurance 2.7x the price listed on their website, intake desk confirmed it was for the exact same services and billing codes. Website advertised $250 cash or an estimated $20 - $100 with in-network insurance. They went ahead and billed my insurance (in-network) for $683 of which I was responsible for $501.24. When I asked to have my bill re-processed as a self pay, they said sorry too late.<//review>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience at this facility.  Tequilea and Vilma went above and beyond to help me in a pinch.  I really appreciate their high level of competency and quality (not to mention their good cheer).  They are first class people providing first class care, and great ambassadors for the organization.  I had never thought about going to a GoHealth facility before but Tequilea and Vilma have made me a loyal customer from this point forward.  Thanks for helping me!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>I broke my foot.  Staff care was fine, though they were unable to see me until the next day as they don't always have X-ray staff in the office.  We gave them our updated insurance info, though my wife expressed that she didn't think that they'd really updated it.  They underestimated the recovery time by about half, and I ultimately needed to see a specialist to make sure I was on the right track.  We received a small bill for crutches within a month or so, which we paid and believed we were all set.

We received a large bill for services 10 months later with no insurance component - they'd run the majority of their billings against the old insurance, which they went back and forth with the insurance company for awhile with.  The issued a bill 10 months after service that had a due date within a week.  We reached out to give them the updated insurance info, which they accepted and told us to disregard the bill, however they declined to mention that they'd already forwarded the bill to collections, so there will be more nonsense to sort out.

They'll fix you, but whatever you don't pay in dollars you'll pay with your time sorting out their incompetence later (why not contact us when the insurance disputed their incorrect information?).  We're lucky that we happened to not move in the meantime.< /text></record>

This is the worst clinic, It has been ten day trying to get a Covid19 test and made three apointments, but till now I’m not able to schedual an apointment, yet since they require a video call first, then they will schedual for the actual test. What kind of health serivce they will provide when then can’t even schedual an apointment for one paitent. I don’t know whether the manger knows about those employees.< /review>

First Edit:

My bill ended up being WAY higher than they originally said. Every single number they told me was less than half of what I ended up paying. I have yet to hear back from them as to why. Was really happy- now not so much.

Second edit:
The very same doctor that worked with me called me up, remembered me personally, checked on me, and suggested how I work with the billing department to get the bill fixed. They corrected it and I’m happy as can be again. Thank you Dignity!<//Review>< rating>

Fantastic service. Was feeling feverish and had a swelling in my arm. Decided to come here since it was close to my office. Checked in, did some paperwork and quickly paid. I was seen almost immediately.

Staff is friendly. The PA I saw was fantastic and very explanatory. The office is sleek, modern, and very clean.

I'd rather drive here than go to the one down the block from my house. (Which had a 48 minute wait vs a 0 minute wait)

There's also a water machine for tea!</text>

I went here with my clogged ear (swimmers ear) at first they just wrote me debrox & antibiotics which worsened my hearing & pain, but when I visited again after 3days then I met "Caroline" who treated me with patience & carefully removed all the wax from my ear when I was done was able to hear clearly n no pain. Thanks to Caroline & front desk service was good too. My 5 stars goes for Caroline.<//text>

<Review>Feels great to have a place like Dignity Health and not have to go to the emergency. You can spend hours in ER. Where’s here, it’s in and out and the same care. But of course if it was serious, serious, they would recommend the ER. So grateful for this facility and the wonderful staff!! 🙏🏼
I highly recommend!< /Review><username>Chateau on Bellevue< /username>< Pictures>

I visited this office back in March of 2019 when I had a case of swimmer’s ear. I could easily say this visit was one of the most uncomfortable and unsatisfying visits I have ever had in my entire life; if I could give 0 stars I would be more than happy to give 0 stars.

I was assigned to Dr. Steven Zhong, who prescribed ear drops and antibiotics. Fair enough. However, Dr. Zhong was very condescending and gave a very snarky smile when I didn’t know what the words “tympanic membrane” or “inner ear” meant; he literally said “you don’t know what an ‘inner ear’ is?” with a very arrogant tone. How would I know what these words mean given that I’m not a specialist in the field and that I almost never encounter problems with my ears? I also felt very rushed out of the room as well; Dr. Zhong clearly showed a lack of genuine concern for his patients and gave off an “ok, next patient” attitude.

In addition to that, the bill for the visit was $205.63 ($391.00 before insurance). How absurd is that? I only received a verbal consultation, and I used Dr. Zhong’s prescription for a week with absolutely no result; my right ear was still completely clogged and had a muffled sound. Luckily, I visited Dr. James Wu a week later in Daly City, who completely removed the excess wax and blood in my ear, gave me genuine advice on how to treat my ear and avoid such problems in the future, and even did a tympanic membrane hearing test for me, all for only $156.42.

What’s more, the billing at this office was completely horrendous and unorganized. I gave the front clerk my primary insurance card and asked her if I could provide my secondary insurance as well; she was busy at the moment and said I could call in later and add my secondary insurance information. Problem is, I never got a bill in my mail! My bill was finally processed in June (yes, 3 months later) and I noticed when browsing my online insurance portal, so I called the office; at that point the representative told me that “it was too late to add my secondary insurance”. I had an address change in August and called again to ask them to mail the bill to me because I never received it; the representative said it will be there within the next 3-5 business days, and once again I never received the bill! I definitely gave her my correct updated address because I even asked her to repeat the address after I gave it to her over the phone.

This office only wants your money and has the most arrogant staff I have ever seen in my life. I'd be somewhat okay with that if Dr. Zhong was at least somewhat competent, but his advice/prescription was completely futile and a waste of my time, as well. I always try to keep an open mind about doctors and the American medical system but this really makes it difficult to not be cynical. I still have not received my bill and I am not going to be surprised if they call collection services to ask me to cough up the money. Do yourself a big favor and never come here.<//text>

I just landed from a 13 hour international flight with the worst cough, sore throat and stomach cramps. Walked in with no appointment and was seen immediately. The doc was about to sort out what was underlying respiratory and what was travel related. Everyone was super friendly and felt really taken care of. Highly recommend! Hopefully I don't have to go back, but if I need urgent care services, that's my place.<//review>

I cannot say enough good things about this auto shop!  We are a military family family moving from Ohio to Washington.  We had repairs to our Jeep done before we started the trek and unfortunately, the work was insufficient.  When we were driving through Willows CA, our Jeep started overheating.  With two kids and two dogs in the car, we were stressed to find an auto shop to help us out.  Several turned us away with no compassion.  Thankfully, Tish was compassionate and got our Jeep in right away! She even had a few suggestions as to what may be the problem and she was right on the money! We walked to a local park with the boys and dogs while the repairs were completed within an hour and half.   This was a life saver!  My family truly appreciates the honest, compassionate business, this is rare to find these days, we are so grateful!<//Review>

Wonderful people! I had a breakdown on I5 last year with my Delica, barely able to make it to the nearest repair garage. They were helpful to squeeze me in. They listened to my explanation of the problem and they did the fix so I was back on the road in about two hours. The price was more than reasonable considering that they saved my vacation. I gladly gave them a tip. I am happy to recommend their services.< /text>

Our AC stopped blowing cold, in the middle of September, in the middle of the day, in the middle of 5 Hour Drive. We were dying! Birdie and Octavio got right on it and helps me and my daughter and three grandkids get back on the road at a very fair price.  Thank you and God bless you.< /review>

They will not keep anything from you. If something needs to be fixed for something you didn't request, they will at least tell you. If you do not have it done then, they'll put it on the invoice so you can be reminded later. They do honest work. Great shop to care for your car.</Review>

<Review>Best service you can ask for! My windshield wipers broke in the middle of a storm and I was three hours from home - O'Brien's did everything they could to help me! They did their best to rush order new parts for my car, offered to work on a Saturday morning to get it fixed as fast as possible, and drove me to a hotel for the night. Not only is my car all fixed, but I also got amazing service and felt genuinely cared for. Thanks so much guys!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Alternator failed on my way to Thunderhill Raceway on a Thursday evening. I already knew it was my alternator that had failed as I was able to measure it's zero output.

Found O'Brien's via web search on Friday morning. After chatting on the phone and asking if they could find the parts necessary as well as install them - to which they said yes.

Well, it didn't turn out to be as simple a job as we all hoped. But the crew got everything done and had my truck ready by the end of the day.

Thanks to everyone involved and all the hard work you all put in.< /text><Date>1433373731641<//Date>< Gmap_id>

I broke down on my way to Lincoln CA, from Bellevue WA.
I limped my car in at 1:30, and they had me fixed and out the door at 4:45, and for much less than I was expecting.
Excellent workmanship, and excellent customer service.
Would definitely recommend.<//Text>

<Review>Tldr: I would avoid this place if possible.

We came in for a smog on a 2001 Dodge Ram. The guy hopped in the truck to drive it into the shop and noticed the gas gauge wasn't working. He asked us if it was broken and we said yes. He proceeds to take it in for a smog and 15 minutes later he drives it out and he tells us it failed because the gas gauge was faulty. He could have easily advised us to fix it, otherwise it would fail. Bad vibes all around.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Let me start off by saying that Facey Medical Group is a fantastic Clinic. They do Urgent Care. But you can also schedule with your physician or your doctor here. This fantastic Clinic is located in Mission Hills California. In the San Fernando Valley. On Sepulveda Boulevard between Rinaldi in San Fernando Mission Boulevard. The staff is always helpful. A my doctor particularly is awesome very attentive to my needs. Thank you so much for being part of my family<//Text>

I have received excellent care from Facey Medical. I have Multiple Sclerosis and both my previous Neurologist Dr. Lekkala (before her move), and my current Neurologist Dr. Doris Cardenas, along with Dr. Vernon Lackman, MD Internal Medicine are extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, innovative and attentive in caring for my physical needs as they arise. I’m very grateful for my team of Facey Doctors! God Bless each of them. Stay Safe & Healthy!< /review>

Today I went to see doctor Stephanie Lopez, this lady treated me rude and beside that she was talking to me frustrated and breathing hard.  I asked her why she was stressed out? She put her eyes up like this.🙄 I asked dr. Lopez if she could check my heart because I have been feeling needles pain. She said “I don’t think that you need an EKG, but do whatever you  want.” She did it, but  very unprofessional. So I went to make a complain and I changed my primary doctor.<//Text>

Do NOT go here for covid testing.  They had us sitting INSIDE  a room with a bunch of cubicles where the man next to us had tested positive.  We were sitting in there for 30 MINUTES.  We were probably MORE exposed at their testing site than we have EVER been.  And then, the physician tried to talk us out of getting a test. I DON'T GET IT!

Opt to go to a testing site where you do not have to get out of your car.  This was the WORST experience!

IF I DIDN'T HAVE COVID WHEN I WALKED IN, I PROBABLY DO NOW!</review>

On Wednesday July 15, 2020 I made an appointment to be seen in the ER at Facey Mission Hills. My scheduled appointment time was 10:08 AM.
The new procedure is very efficient, minimizing wasted time.
I went to the ER for injuries to my back that I had sustained in a fall, on Tuesday the 14th,
I was very fortunate in that I was seen by Doctor Ana S. Lopes. I found her to be very thorough, knowledgeable and caring.
She requested x-rays, that proved to be inconclusive, so she then requested an MRI.
The MRI was completed at Holy Cross in Mission Hills at 6:30 PM on Thursday July e16th.
At 8:45 PM tonight Thursday July 16, Doctor Lopes contacted me at home to convey the prognosis, no fracture to the ribs or spine.
I would consider Doctor Ana S. Lopes a very valuable asset to Facey Medical Group.<//Text>

<Review>This was my first visit at the medical group, since my doctor had switch groups. Even though I told them I would be paying cash for the visit when I scheduled my appointment, once I arrived they told me I couldn’t since I was under a medical group which was not in there plan. Who turns down a cash visit to see a doctor. They couldn’t even give me a clear explanation. I wasn’t allowed to see my doctor. Facet medical group is the WORST!!!!!!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Facey is going downhill fast and not what it was a few years ago.   You can't even see your primary physician unless you're willing to wait for several months.  And if you need to see a specialist it's even worse.  The attitude of the nurses is going downhill as well because they are probably overworked and understaffed. Weird Customer Service no body in information desk This is really becoming an issue.   I've been with Facey for 20 years.  It wasn't great about 5 years ago....  then greatly Improved and provided quality and prompt care..... and is sadly now going downhill again at an alarming rate.   Time for me to look elsewhere for quality care. Getting medical record its not easy they are using third party and to get it you need to call be ready awaiting time on the phone 2 hours  plus a fee....very disappointed!!!

Dr. Wilson is the worst excuse for a doctor. Her and her staff are horrible, even before the virus thing began. From what my mom tells me, the wait time is over an hour and they make it seem like the patient is late but the doctor will see them anyway. What doctor doesn't take vitals if nothing else? (mind you, for an elderly person especially). Whether it's a follow up or not, it's usually protocol. Anything can develop within just a couple of months, more so when there has been high stress due to family deaths and such. . I've got to convince my mom to change to an actual doctor, not someone who arrives super late and does absolutely nothing but charge a huge bill.<//text>

<date>1572035089382< /date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I went into their urgent care with lower right abdominal pain. Can we say appendicitis? They told me it was just an ovary on my cyst and nothing to worry about. I tried to convince them and they just wrote me off and made me leave. I drove myself to the next closest ER (whom I didn’t have insurance through) and told them I was in severe pain and sure enough they did a scan and I had appendicitis. I had to have my appendix removed and by this time it had already exploded. Thanks Facey you literally almost killed me! Facey seems to hire doctors that barely passed in their schooling. You can’t trust any diagnosis they make.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>This was my first time here as I just moved here. I went in to get a check up on a test that had come back irregular, and everyone was so nice! Up until the nurse practitioner that was doing my test made me feel like an idiot for wanting to get this test now rather than wait till the end of the year. She practically laughed in my face and told me that all of my family history had nothing to do with this test. You would think doctors would want the full history especially when treating a new patient. The whole point is to calm your patients and treat them when they’re nervous about previous test results. I would come back but I would not see that doctor again. Completely unprofessional of her. She should take notes from her colleagues on patient care.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>First time at this facility for a follow up at the doctors advice from an urgent care for a virus he wanted me to have a test done to see if I had asthma, they asked a bunch of question about what he other doctor did and gave me I mentioned my Oxygen was low when I saw him it was at 92% so he put me on a nebulizer and I felt better!
so also they also put me on a nebulizer of albuterol and Ipratropium I had not eaten and I had a very bad reaction of shakiness and very light head! I have had inhalers with Albuterol prior.
I felt I did not need to have a nebulizer I felt fine! So while on it my blood pressure went up to 171/104 hence they gave me prescription for  BP pills and an inhaler that would have cost me $200 which I could not pay for! It’s a shame you wait so long for an in and out visit that takes 2.5 hours and a massive bill most people cannot pay! Disappointing results</text><GmapID>0x80c2906b93c7e289:0xc46d8a0a536a5417</GmapID>< rate>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>The absolute worst doctors on this planet. My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer Only after I rush her to emergency at holy cross . For over a year she complained to her personal physician of chest pains. Unfortunately her doctor was absolutely the bottom of the barrel . Played it off as a cold . Heard similar nightmare frustrating stories from other patients that were in the fate of Facey doctors . My mother passed away soon after . but perhaps if she was diagnosed sooner , I do believe she would be alive now. Stay away from these 3rd rate doctors.</Text>< Pics>

I have been with Facey for nearly thirty years. I am, and remain, very impressed with their comprehensive and efficient service. The Doctors are always polite, friendly and very thorough. The Facilities, and I use several different ones, are always clean, modern and impressive. Cannot recommend them enough. I complained for years about the phone delays, but they seem to have control of even that now. Good job Facey, Keep it up!.</review>

There were paper signs all over the Facey lot but NO signs saying that non-customers couldn't park there.  As we were walking to the sidewalk I noticed a man dressed vaguely as a guard skulking toward that.  He didn't try to get our attention or the other peoples'; he just walked to our cars and started taking pictures of our license plates.  He was NOT leaving any notes on the cars.  I walked back and asked what he was doing.  He said he was taking pictures because we weren't supposed to be there.  We told him there was no sign saying so, and he said "I am the sign."  This is the first "sign" that I've seen that skulks around taking pictures and doesn't give actual information to you.  I did think it's a kind of sign.  Whoever bought the premises chose this man and gave him that mission because this is how they see PEOPLE--as problems.  It's a very BAD sign in my opinion.<//Text>< user>

<Text>This place is a joke, my daughter was just taken there this morning, by her aunt. She is running a high fever, and nauseated, and what my sister was told was to take her to the ED dept. as they stated her insurance was HMO,. I think the receptionist there need to be better educated. As my daughters insurance is not HMO and they refused to see her because of that. They did not offer to pay out of pocket for services.  How can you turn away patients just because you are ignorant in your field.  I'm very frustrated with this type of services.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.

Facey is the best. Friendly staff, actual doctors that know medicine. Like anywhere you need to check out your own docs. I've only changed once so far. The bottom line is check ins are easy, appts are usually on time and rarely late. It's the people and staff that make it. I hate hospitals and< /Text>

<review>I have really liked my doctors here but the whole building seems poorly managed. I’ve been here more than 5 times now and I ALWAYS wait more than an hour after my appointment time to see my doctors.

Edit: review downgraded from 2 to 1. I had a sample taken and after 2 weeks of no results, I called my doctor’s office to follow up. It took 4 calls over 2 weeks to get a callback. I got my bill before I even got my results! We might call this another administrative issue but when I finally got a call back, it was obvious that my doctor 1) didn’t remember my case 2) didn’t take note about what I said during the last visit.< /review>< Rating>

Worst medical office I have ever been. The Northridge office moved to new location almost 10 month ago, they lost all the patient's contacts, I had Dr. visit for extensive blood exam & that was in Nov. 2017, till this day I haven't heard from them in regards to the results, neither received a letter explaining what I need … I called the Dr office, the nurse promised to send the result but they failed, I called after 2 months again & they promised to send again, but they never did. If it was possible to not give any star I would do. without shame they said that they lost their patients contact due to their mistake, I asked them to contact the bus. office to obtain mine, they said they can't locate, because the info was lost in the server. What a reliable medical office... I will not return to Facey med. office again & do not recommend to any one.< /Text>

<Review>I am very happy and thankful to say  that Ms. Leticia Bustos(phone room) provided excellent customer service. I had to cancel an appoinment and reschedule it due to a family emergency. She was very kind and understanding and tried her best to provide another appointment date. I really appreciate her kindness and compassion.

No a very happy camper,  I make an appointment at 10:40am, I show up at 10:35am and they tell me they won't be able to see me until almost 11:40am!!!!! How upsetting!!!!! I'm loosening money here people!!!!!!! No a way to do things! If an appointment is made, the time should be respected.

I might just changed to a different Dr.!!!

They seem to care at first but after I got my testing done (which clearly something was working with me at the time) my doc never called me and and all they did was waste my time and money. Then they make it seem like I'm on the bad person and got a letter that they are not going to further assist me. Don't worry I don't need your business. Hope the 100 dollars was worth losing a patient.<//Review>

<review>By far Face has to be one of the worst Medical Groups out there.  My review is overall on Facey and not the actual dr that I saw.

On 11/27 I had an appointment with Dr. Singh, she referred me downstairs to get lab work and for 24 hour Urine analysis.  The lab downstairs is Quest, upon the phlebotomist drawing my blood I asked if I could drop off the urine at a Quest near my home (I live on the West Side of the valley), he advised me that I can drop it off at any Quest.

I attempted to drop off the urine at a Quest in Northridge.  Unfortunately they would not take it, they advised me that no lab orders were in place.

I called the dr's office, was advised that I can drop off at Facey in Northridge, proceeded to drive to Facey in Northridge only to arrive to an empty building, it appears that Facey in Northridge had moved and yet their employee had no knowledge of this.

Long story short no amount of apologies from Facey can get me to ever go back to Facey!  Years ago they messed up with my son and here I am giving them a 2nd chance and the minute I do, they are already screwing up!  Shame on you Facey for not educating your employees properly! A 24 hour Urine collection is not simple when you work 8 plus hours in an office.  I had to strategically plan getting that collection out to you guys, and then it all went to waste because the limited window that I had to drop off the specimen was missed on account of your lack of training employees.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Moderation sedation was not sufficient to put me under to not feel the scope going through my insides; never was expressed that I would not be "out" for the procedure. I have been put out for oral surgery numerous times so that I know was not an issue.Asked to have procedure stopped because of the pain and Dr. Beshay refused. No sympathy, no sorry it hurt.

Great doctors!  I've seen Dr Ana S Lopes, Dr Malika C Singh, Dr Kamyar Amini, Dr Magued F Beshay and few other, in last 7+ years, and ALL have been GREAT!  Sure I've had to wait, but sooo worth it!<//review>

I am new to Facey. I was transitioning from one medical office to Facey. I have severe back and hip pain and am on meds as a result. From the moment I walked in, I was treated like some kind of drug addict bc of the meds I needed. Both doctors that I saw rushed through the appointment with me and never truly listened to anything that I said and just referred me to pain management before even listening to my issue. Of course, even once I was approved for PM it was going to take me a month to get an appointment. I tried to talk to my doctor at Facey to see if I could get meds to hold me over until my appointment and was told flat out NO. Instead the doctor suggested that I try detox as if my injuries that required medication were made up. I've been going through hell for years trying to get my back, feet and hips fixed and I thought Facey would be the ones to help me finally. Instead, they made me feel like some kind of criminal that was lying about my injuries... Even though she had a MRI in front of her showing damage. So even tho I pay for good insurance now, I'm not only NOT getting the help I need... But I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong by asking for medication that I NEED and have been on for YEARS. And both female doctors that I saw, just rushed through the appointment not even listening to me or caring. I left the building in tears today.  They doctor didn't even go through my new patient chart to address the concerns that I had. They didn't request the referrals that I needed or give me birth control that I asked for. It was like as soon as they saw I needed pain meds, I was just some druggie that they wanted out of the office. Thanks a lot docs, I thought you would be my saving grace but instead you just made my pain and depression worse. So I still have no answers as to why I'm in so much pain and no pain medication to help me in the meantime. I could have kept getting this kind of treatment with Medi-Cal...< /Text>

I have been with Facey for approximately 10 years and have yet to experience anything bad or wrong with the medical staff. I am very pleased with the care of my family that they have done.< /text>

<rate>1</rate><text>My wife and I have been patients with Facey Medical Group 20 years. However , the management and staff have lost their ability to be companionate , it's all about Money.
When our doctor decided to retire , he asked my wife to come in so they could say goodbye. He recommended a doctor to takeover his patients. Then that doctor called my wife in for a meet and greet. FACEY charged my wife who is permanently disabled , $100 for each visit. These were more social than medical meetings. Within weeks , FACEY ejected and HealthCare Partners took over.
Shortly after that , the new doctor was discharged , resulting in average care at best.
But FACEY has threatened us with collection ,  even after several attempts asking for these charges to be dropped. We all have suffered thru financial difficulties after the collapse in 2009. For those of us trying to recover on just one income , recovery has been slow and hard. It doesn't help when a greedy medical group like FACEY behaves with such malice. It's been a over a year ago and they can't listen to reason and let it go.
Be careful when dealing with FACEY. Their interests are not about the patient , only your money.<//text>< Pics>

I waited a long time in the little room the put you in. They told me it would be a few minutes I was in there for about 45 minutes before I walked out. This is unacceptable. The owner should stop apologizing and do something.< /review>

<Review>There used to be so many frozen yogurt places but now only a few survived the over competition so I'm glad Yogurtland is still here. It's in the Safeway plaza so free parking could be somewhat difficult on a busy day but there should be enough paid parking on the streets and in those metered lots. For covid they are allowing one party inside the store at one time so you'll have to wait in line outside. Not much else to say if you know how frozen yogurt store operates.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1617755038618, 'text': "Ed thanks again for the positive feedback!

<Review>I came here after finish shopping at Safeway at 8:15pm and the door were locked, when there is a sign in the door saying they close at 8:30pm. The lady inside saw me and didn’t even say anything just looked back to her phone and the other young lady just went inside. I think is really rude, they didn’t even say anything just pretended I wasn’t at the door! This place definitely lost my business!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1614019896145, 'text': 'Larissa , thank you so much for your feedback.

< Review>
Came here for a birthday treat!
2* for very few yogurt flavor selection compared to other Yogurtland locations I've been.
5* for wide selection of toppings.
2* for runny consistency.
5* good location, outdoor seating
2* ample free parking (shared lot) but none available (09/28/18, Friday at 2:30 pm)</Review>

I used to love to go there, but they have a really scary lady working there who yells at customers and gives you dirty looks. I am so uncomfortable that I don’t want to go back. Plus they are out of a lot of flavors all the the time and the place is dirty. It used to be well stocked and clean. Maybe instead of yelling at customers, the rude blonde lady should try refilling the flavors and cleaning up! The yogurt tastes good though.</text>

<Review>A fairly small place with a handful of tables, Yogurtland is simplistically decorated. Sporting a chalkboard menu with 9 unique flavors and 7 topping options, one scoop of ice cream without toppings will set you back $5.50. Add $1 per topping and another $1 for a waffle cone and you're looking at about $7.50 for a trip to the ice cream shop.</Review>< Pictures>

What makes a 5-star yogurt shop. Well compared to the competition they have the most flavors, with new flavors all the time. They have good prices, and lots of topping choices. Can't think of anything else that a yogurt shop could do to earn another star. There is a bathroom just down the way beyond the 5-guys if you need to wash up after your treat.<//text>

Frozen yogurt doesn't get any better than this! Tried different shops but yogurtland is the best by far. The flavors are spot on and all natural!!! I love how they keep introducing new flavors.

That peanut butter though! Oh so delicious! The place is very clean all the time and the staff is always friendly. There's a few benches outside so you can sit and enjoy your frozen treat in the sun.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The frozen yogurt tastes great and there's a variety of options to choose from. I recommend the New York Cheesecake but that's just me. A diverse choice of toppings as well and the customer service was great. Shoutout to Nacho and Chris for making it such a pleasant experience and making me and our party feel comfortable. They were very humorous and kind as well. Would definitely return to come get froyo again.< /Text>< Pics>

Customer Service is excellent, product is as expected - it's frozen pseudo icecream that always tastes to me like it's made from products containing 7 syllables or more emerging from a lab.  Fun on occasion to eat tho.</text>

<review>Tasty yogurt selection, lots of toppings, both fruit and candy. This place is so good, the two closest yogurt places had to shut down.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1379817275384<//Time><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>
<Review>After being a customer for almost a year, walking into a store with estatic employees, and always having delicious yogurt always on tap, I can say I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon. As I entered the store, the one employee was leaning against the wall oblivious of his surroundings. After filling my cup with my selection of treats I went to pay for it. I handed the child 2 $2 bills, and he refused it. He claimed due to store policy they can no longer accept legal US tender. Sorry, my bottle caps are in my other pocket. On top of this he refused to let me to speak to his supervisor.<//Review>< user_id>

Only one Asian young boy is friendly.
Old lady is very mean.

None of the staff cleaned up spilled yogurt outside the door.  Alomost fell.,

I like frozen yogurt.. But I won't return
Too bad .. My favorite place NUBI shut down.,, I have to drive to Millbrae next time...< /text>< Pics>

Dispensers are often not working and have flavours that I don't want. The dispensers are also very unclean and unkept.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very rich ... but the saleswoman went out to smoke and the truth up to my head hurt my daughters, it still smelled like cigarettes ... we were always there ... we had that bad experience I give it 2 stars for today

(Translated by Google) Very rude staff! No view of the weighing scale, the employee announces a price that is impossible to verify and you REQUIRE to put a ticket in the tip pot !!!!!! I have never seen this anywhere else !! Los Angeles yogurtlands are much nicer than this one which is to be avoided !!

(Original)
Personnel très désagréable ! Pas de vue sur la balance de pesée, l'employée vous annonce un prix impossible à vérifier et vous OBIGLE à mettre un billet dans le pot à pourboire !!!!!!

<Review>Awesome, friendly service at very reasonable price, and done when they said it would be! Having owned my own AAA-rated auto repair shop prior to retirement, I can tell you that nobody can do that every single time (done on time), but these folks do it more often than most.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>With their main specialist for my service issue falling ill, they were way behind schedule returning my van. Once he was back they scrambled to complete the work so I could begin a weekend trip. When Doug called to say the van was ready it was close to closing time on Friday and I was on the other side of the county. He said he'd wait for me. After creeping through rush hour traffic I finally got my van and both of us were finally able to start our weekends. More important, their recommended repairs were successful in making a more stable and safer driving experience.</Review></record>

Everyone treated us very well. They kept us up to date and did everything they said they would and even didn’t do some of the things I thought we needed which saved us hundreds of dollars.

They have earned our business every time we need our RV serviced in the future!< /Review>

I have never gone to anyone but Specialized for more than 20 years, and for good reason.  The mechanics are top notch and actually go to other shops to further enhance their skills.  Their prices are reasonable and the work is wonderful.  That said, the best part is their customer service.  They are kind and caring, they explain what they believe needs to happen in detail and offer informed choices.  They consistently go above and beyond and I am grateful.  Thank you, Specialized!  :)< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><rate>4<//rate><review>Had issues with my MH dually's gaining tire pressure,  my TPMS, sounded high pressure alarms, saying the inside driver side tpressure went from 80 psi to 97psi. I thought maybe I had a brake dragging or something causing the temperature of the rim to heat up and cause the tire pressure to raise. All the rear dually's rose about 10 to 12psi during the trip. Specialized Auto, checked out all the brakes and found them in good working condition with no evidence of being overheated. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, is they didn't check the tire pressures before they took the rig on a 59 mile test ride, then again afterwards to determine what, if any, there was any tire pressure gained on the test drive, as their tire pressure gauges are certified for accuracy, but overall, I'm happy with their service.< /review></record>

Recently Specialized Auto Watsonville  replaced the timing belt on my 2004 Volvo and did some additional regular service.  Great job done on time and at a fair price.  We are long time customers of Specialized and their auto repair work and customer service are truly 5 star.   Thank You Aaron and your Team!!

< review>
Went in to take my 2006 bmw for a battery registration. According to the work order they were going to check my charging system to make sure it was working properly. When I went back for updates on the vehicle, I was told the vehicle had the incorrect battery, work order states that mechanic just saw it had the incorrect battery and left it alone. Tried to work with them about getting the correct battery with no additional registration charge, however I was told I was still going to have a second registration charge once the correct battery was installed, even if I purchased it from them and had them install it. If you decide to go make sure you have the correct part or else you’ll be charged first for telling you have the incorrect part and second to install the right part.< /review>

<Text>Specialized Auto replaced the starter on my BMW at a reasonable price. Aaron is knowledgeable and a honest communicator, explains everything in a easy to understand way. I would recommend Specialized Auto to anyone interested in working with the very Best auto repair team available.
Added bonus, Specialized Auto washes your car for you when picked up. And offer shuttle service if needed. Service at it’s Best.<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1573169261764, 'text': 'Hi Diana, we’re sorry that you didn’t enjoy your experience here.  Our recommendations for maintenance due on your Mercedes Benz are based on the factory service intervals published by the manufacturer.  It is not simply our informed opinion that dictates the recommendations for service on your car, we rely upon the highly proficient and intelligent engineers who designed and built it.  While we do know a thing or two about automotive repair and maintenance, we don’t purport to be smarter than Mercedes Benz, so if they recommend certain maintenance criteria, we think it’s best to follow them.  Failure to follow your vehicle’s factory maintenance schedule can (and often does) lead to premature failures that require expensive repairs.  When we talked to you about the deferred maintenance due on your car you told us that you were aware of the additional needs the car had and that you had already booked an appointment at the Mercedes dealership to have the work done.  We assured you that we are perfectly capable and certified to perform the additional maintenance needed, but you repeatedly rebutted us and insisted that you preferred to take your car to the dealer for other needs and that you simply wanted us to change your oil.  We asked if you intended to only bring your vehicle to our shop for oil changes and to always take it to the dealer for additional repairs and maintenance, to which you replied, “Yes.”  Not once did you say anything about not having enough money to cover the cost of maintenance your car needs.  If you had simply said something to the effect of, “I know my car is due for more maintenance, I just can’t afford it right now,” we would have happily done your oil change and given you a list of future recommendations to plan for.  We do this for people every single day.  Taking care of your car is expensive, and European cars tend to cost a little more than average to keep in top running condition.  We declined to work on your car because you made it clear you only wanted to use our shop for oil changes, and you claimed you had an appointment at the dealer to take care of everything else.  Based on your review, you weren’t exactly telling us the whole truth of the matter.  We’re disappointed that we couldn’t reach a more mutually beneficial agreement, and we would encourage you to be more honest and open in your future business dealings, you’ll probably get better results.'}< /response>
<Pics>None</Pics><review>if i could  give negative stars i would.
I made an apt. for an oil change on my car. The day of the apt. I dropped off the car and made sure that they had the keys and reiterated that I just needed an oil change. When they heard that my car had more than 60,000 miles they told me that it was RECOMMENDED that I get a transmission flush, break fluid’s, Spark plugs, cabin filters, etc.  I told them “no that’s fine ill just get the oil change for today.” About 35 minutes after I dropped off my car I get a call from the shop telling me that if I didn’t want to get the services done at the shop they didn’t want to change my oil. His words were “our shop stays running from maintenance services not just from changing oil.” I told them I just want an oil change I don’t have the money to get the rest of the services done, so they told me that they refused to change my oil. I stopped by within 5 minutes after I hung up and my car was still parked where and how I left it. When I went inside to pick up my car keys they told me “your car will be right out they are bringing it from the back” I told them, “my car is parked right where I left it, you guys didn’t even look at it before you started recommending extra services.” They just looked at each other and gave me my car keys. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK. They will tell you need services that you don’t really need just to make money. I took my car in to another shop that same day and they told me my car was fine and that an oil change was sufficient maintenance.< /review><gmapID>0x808e1a44fce0cb7f:0xb671f5adb46146d5< /gmapID><UserId.>113420903283242249667</UserId.></record>

I have been a customer at specialized for 20 years and I wouldn’t go anywhere else. No matter what car issue I have had it has been fixed promptly and reasonably priced .
At the Freedom Store where I currently go I can wait at the Starbucks for my oil change or get a ride home and back for a larger service.
The staff is friendly and make you feel at ease over any car issue. They often go beyond what is expected to make sure your car is road worthy. Plus they wash your  car before pick up!< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>2018: Excellent service, very friendly and helpful - beyond what is normally expected.  I purchased my first Volvo from Specialized and they did all servicing  on it.  Was so impressed, I purchased a second Volvo and they have been servicing it as well.  Quality of work is above standard and the level of helpfulness is outstanding.

8-10-15:  Still impressed with Specialized after all these years.  Now that they service American cars as well as imports, anyone can take their car there to be serviced.  Excellent customer relations and very high quality of work.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1509049775478, 'text': 'Thank you Dianne!

We were driving through town when we had unexpected car troubles. Rick was able to help us identify the issue, give sound advice ablut where to get it fixed (since we were on a time crunch and he didn't have the part), and let us know what to expect price wise. He definitely did not have to help us at all and was super friendly and helpful.</Text>

Specialized took very good care of my Mini.  I brought it in for a mis-fire and identified the problem quickly.  They provided an accurate estimate regarding time and cost and I had my car back that afternoon running perfectly.  Their shuttle service got me to and from work conveniently.  I would highly recommend Specialized Auto and will continue to take my car to them.< /Text>

<Time>1550544081355< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>So I decided to take my c230 in for some codes I was getting. First visit they diagnose possible bad sensors for the timing chain so I pay 300. After driving the car a couple of days I get the check engine light again. I take it in again and again they say other sensors need to be replaced. So after keeping my car for over 4 days to change 4 sensors that supposibly have something to do with keeping the timing right I get my car back. After all this I end up paying 1000 dollars for these sensors. So today when picking up my car they said that nothing was fixed and that they need to look further into what might be causing the codes. They quote me 7000 dollars! During this whole time I'm searching for problems with my car and I find out that these cars had an issue with the gears that turn the timing chain. Gears weren't casted correctly by Mercedes. So this issue is known but Specialized Auto and Fleet decide to get as much money from me as possible. And after getting home and checking my car I see that only 2 sensors were replaced and I still got charged full price. Now after talking with Mercedes they inform me that the issue is common with my model and I need to take it in for them to go in there with the camera to see how bad the gears are runned down. They quote me 180 for this. At Specialized I get quoted 400. They are just after the money so I suggest taking your business elsewhere.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Bad diagnosis (I hope). Took in car because I was hearing a "CLUNK" from the back. They told me it was coming from the differential, 100%. I needed a new one and it would cost $1200. Something felt off about the whole thing, so I got another opinion.

Differential was in great shape. My rear suspension was loose. A $40 fix. Thing is, to replace the differential they would have had to take off the suspension and put it back on. In doing so, would have "fixed" the issue.

A bad diagnosis that would have cost me $1200, or just a cleaver ripoff. Either way, certainly lost my trust.<//Review><user_id>100540728653074866386< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics><Time>1509568859603< /Time><response>{'time': 1509047967009, 'text': "Hi Jason, we're sorry you didn't have a good experience.

< review>
I have been taking my cars & motorhome to Specialized Auto & Fleet, 2114 Freedom Blvd, Freedom, CA 95019 for many years and will continue to do so.  They are the most knowledgeable mechanics around Santa Cruz as far as I am concerned.  The reason I first started taking my cars to them is because they were always fixing problems that nobody else could figure out.  Furthermore, I think they know more about motor homes than the actual motorhome mechanics in the area.  They are always very friendly & courteous.  They always wash your car when they are done.  They have a courteous shuttle & will take you to where you need to go &/or pick you up.  The managers are always very fair and easy to talk to.  Whatever may be wrong with your car, or motorhome, is always explained in detail & thoroughly.  Specialized is no more expensive than any of the other shops, but even if they were, at least you would know it was done right.<//review>

Absolutely LOVE these guys.  They've serviced my car for 10 plus years!!!!  Literally not a single negative experience.  They've serviced two BMW's (135i, E82 and 328, E90), Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Camry, Audi A4 and kept every single on of my cars running perfect.  I seriously can't speak any higher of these guys, the head mechanic is exceptional and customer service is lights out.  I will be a customer for life...even if I had to drive an hour to drop my car off for service here...I would do it.  Take your car here and ask questions, they'll have ALL of the answers.<//text>

Let me just say that I needed a rental car and Aaron provided one. I needed help shifting the rental car into reverse and Aaron provided it. I needed Aaron to drive and meet me to help me, and he did that. I needed help tacking a detached door part, and Aaron made sure it got reattached. Customer service is very important to me, and you guys provide it in spades.</Text>

We are on a long road trip in our Toyota Landcruiser and started hearing a humming noise. With another 1000 miles to go, we needed a quick analysis.

Aaron said they were really busy but would take a look. As soon as we arrived, a mechanic took a ride and quickly diagnosed the likely issue. They topped off a few fluids and told us what to watch for and advised we should be fine getting home, and to have our regular mechanic check it out upon our return.

No charge and definitely peace of mind. Thank you Specialized!< /Text>

<review>I've been using the services of Specialized Auto repeatedly for years since they gave me a quote for scheduled maintenance and it came in significantly less than the brand name dealer.  I gave them a try and was pleasantly surprised.  The rest is history.

I'm also quite confident in the fact that they know their stuff and have saved me from unnecessary repair costs.  If a service or repair seems high prices to you, it would likely be more elsewhere.

I recommend you give them a try.  I think you'll be quite satisfied.< /review>< Resp>

I just returned from my second visit on Freedom Blvd Shop.            First time I had my used vista  cruiser serviced after I purchased it.    When I called to schedule an appointment I talked to Rick.   Everyone there was very friendly and know  their business.        After traveling 10,000 miles I was due for an oil change and they sent me a reminder.   I also had a problem with wires shorting out .   I called and service was outstanding.   Oil changed and wire problem tracked down and fixed.    Would recommend to anyone.< /text>

Had my brothers car towed into them after it died on him while in SF. My husband thought it was the timing chain so we took it in to get a confirmative dx and idea on cost. Specialized said the timing chain was fine and gave the dx of a computer module, spark plugs and boots ($700 repair). My husband later replaced all of the parts suggested and still nothing. Took it to get a second opinion and it was the timing chain. Should not have wasted the almost $300 they charged us to give us a wrong dx. I always recommended Specialized and brought our cars here up until now.</Text>

The guys in Watsonville, especially Aaron, are top notch in service and personality. They don't do "auto speak," but explain everything in lay terms and provide options when available. Their knowledge is broad working with fleets, foreign cars, as well as Fords & Chevys.
If you want to confidently know your auto service is done correctly, go to Specialized Auto!</Review>

< Review>
not too happy with this shops service advisor. hard to figure why a simple phone call cannot be made to vehicle owner to let them know what is happening. I have to call them is this the way customer service is suppose to be . and when I arrive to pick up vehicle wow what a shock the cost was over priced  and the vehicle ran like ??????
barely made it home no power. when I asked why they told me you didn't bring it in for that .  I drove off spending allot of money there they could have at least told me what was needed before I came in to pick up vehicle. I know all people have there days I know I do but I think it would have been in there better interest to keep customer service in mind. sorry guys your front office reflects the mechanics that do the work. try to be more customer friendly tell people what they need without asking for there credit card you will find they will be more willing to hand it too you when the work is don e right<//Review>

<review>I had my grandmothers "new" used 1997 Chevy Lumina smog checked here. I also had a 1988 Turbo Volvo serviced 5~ years ago here. Time for a review!

Amazing service, 5/5 stars- I am a mechanic myself but for the volvo I needed 10+ years of turbo blown oil off the engine/engine bay. They fixed the leak & cleaned it spotless, car manual slave failed in their shop. Let me say that was totally unexpected, and they got me going at very little cost.

The smog of the Lumina went great, and if our gas cap (We had two already in the car) wasnt bad, we'd of been out of there 35 minutes after walking in, and made our DMV appointment. Speedy Oil couldn't do a smog for 2 hours later then our DMV appointment. Thanks for the quick smog service Specialized!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Service is ok but they are very expensive.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1519671677200, 'text': "Thanks for your feedback Bryon.  We agree that car repair is expensive, sometimes the expenses of repairing a 20 year old Mercedes Benz with 246,000 miles like yours seem daunting when compared to the actual value of the car.  We strive to remain affordable while still being able to pay our rent and pay our employees a living wage and health insurance while existing in one of the most expensive places in the world to live.  We do lots of price comparisons with other shops in the area and we have found that we charge about the same as everyone else while providing a much higher level of service, and we charge significantly less than dealerships.  We're sorry that we've made you feel priced out of repairing your car, please let us know if there's anything we can do to improve your experience in the future."}</response>< Gmap_id>

I was coming through town on a road trip when I noticed my car sounding different! I called to see if they could check out my car and they squeezed me in and had everything fixed in no time. They were so very kind and helpful. Cant thank them enough for their service!</Text>

Jay could not have been more understanding and supportive. We were 3000 miles from home, had a failed Y pipe that I had safety wired in Boise to get to Crescent City, but was failing and melting our van bumper. We were due to leave the next day. The great folks at Two Guys welded a new y pipe in and even changed the oil, all while I waited. Meeting Jay and his crew a true blessing as traveling strangers.<//review>

<text>2 Guys Auto mounted a hitch receiver on the front of my truck. I called quite a few shops that were booked out way in advance, and even more that never returned my calls before I found this shop. They were friendly and did great work, plus they didn’t charge me for the additional labor hours when my appointment took longer than expected. I’d definitely recommend this place!</text><resp>None<//resp><name>Alexine Langdon</name><Time>1613949189672</Time><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x54d06622d617bd65:0x2d926dc907f39109< /gmap_id></record>

We are on vacation with our motorhome. The tail pipe got smashed pulling into a parking lot (curb was closer than we thought). We were afraid to drive it with the tailpipe pinched shut, so we came to Two Guys. They immediately assisted us. They were very helpful,  pleasant and kind. A HUGE thank you to these guys! I would recommend them anytime!</Text>

Very good pricing.
But Could not figure out the issues i was having with my vehicle and told me they were out of ideas.
I had to return the vehicle multiple times after they said it was fixed, They replaced parts that did not need to be replaced and even broke my driver door handle and neglected to tell me.
If you want cheap affordable auto repair this is the place to go but my experience was not good.<//Text>

What an amazing experience.  We came in this morning because we had a problem with our truck camper and needed it to be looked at fast and needed to get back on the road. The gentleman was in fact , a gentleman.  He understood that we were traveling on a dead line and that we were on a budget.  He took us in immediately.  If I can give 10 stars I would. Highly recommend the two guys .< /Text>

So disappointed in this place. We’ve taken multiple vehicles here for muffler work. And all times the welds did not hold and he did not do accurate work but charged the same. My boyfriend even had to crawl under there to show him.

Well recently we took another vehicle there (when I requested we find somewhere else) to get muffler work. He quoted me a price and we ended up paying way more than the quote. For the same amount of time.< /Review>

<Review>Great service, honest and helpful. I was in the middle of a long drive and stressed about having to stop for repairs, they got me in first thing in the morning. The guy working there took the time to drive my vehicle/trailer around town with me in the vehicle to explain the problem I was having, and when he determined it was an issue they couldn’t fix he actually drove me straight to a different shop (and went into the other shop to talk to the other mechanics) so that I would get service right away. Charged me nothing for all the help. Super thankful!!<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>We were traveling from Michigan and about 3,600 miles into our road trip. Had power steering fuse blow and managed to make it into crescent city. We went to 4 other auto parts stores, including the GMC dealer ship and were told they couldn't help us, being lack of parts and on the weekend. Found our way to Two Guys, and the friendly staff took care of us quickly and efficiently. They were the nicest people we've met in California so far and only charged us for parts. The experience was extremely relieving and we are so darn grateful for their assistance. Happy to have been treated so well, especially after all the miles and questionable city surroundings here. Thank you guys so much for getting us back on the road, you all rock and saved us!<//Review><user>102093615504024741890<//user><Time>1558206112691</Time><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

This place is the best! We were traveling and pulling a travel trailer. We were having lighting issues (no brake lights). They got us right in and got us on our way in just a couple hours. Would have been way less if lunch hadn't fallen within that time. Price was reasonable and the staff were the best! We definitely recommend them!< /Text>

I cannot fully express how well these folks treated me. I was in a bind when my alternator quit on me while I was on a very lengthy road trip. It was Friday when I realized my car was going to break down at any second (Friday is not the day you want to break down in a small town), but these people helped me and I was back on the road in under two hours. They are an honest, kind, and fair business.</review>

<text>The best service I have EVER received from a shop. When is the last time you were able to call a shop, get in with in half hour and be charged reasonably? I can't say enough good things about Two Guys! From the sweet young lady that answered the phone to the friendly gentleman at the counter to the knowledgeable mechanic that did the work, I am so grateful this kind of service is still out there! Being in town for the Jaycee tournament, over 4 hours away from home, things could have gone bad, lucky for me I called Two Guys Automotive!</text>< pictures>

Great service and great people. While traveling through Crescent City on a road trip my engine overheated.  I arrived at the shop at 9am, told them the trouble I was having.  They took my car right away and within two hours I was back on the road with a newly installed thermostat. The price was extremely fair.  I wish they had a shop in my hometown. I would be a loyal customer.</text>

These guys can do anything!  I needed a handicap scooter lift installed in the back of a Subaru Forester.  They did the job perfectly and at a reasonable price.  No more awkward ramps needed.  The electric hoist is solidly mounted and lifts a 300 pound scooter in and out easily.  Thanks 2-guys!</Text>

Two guys saved me on a Saturday!!! The powersteering fuse blew on my vehicle. I was traveling through town, a long ways from home. I tried stopping at the dealership and o Riley, and called Walmart and autozone, with no luck. Two guys immediately took my car back, called around for the fuse I needed, proceeded to go pick it up, and installed it for me. All for only 8$ They were incredibly friendly and helpful. Let me stand inside their garage out of the rain while waiting. Couldn’t be more appreciative of their service!!!<//text>

<review>These guys are very helpful! Knowledgeable on there stuff, they have a great welder, who can weld anything that need to get fix. I needed to replace my oil pan, because of running over a rock, but they told me they could weld it. Which I was a happy about. Now my GF and I can enjoy our trip down the coast.< /review></record>

I was passing through on my way to San Francisco and my car was making odd noises. Jake took a look at it in under 10 minutes and let me know what the exact situation was. If I wasn’t pressed for time and it wasn’t already 5, I definitely would stay and have him do the repairs. No charge, extremely helpful, and so friendly.</Text>

Had a bad run of luck and broke a strut on our truck, limped back into Crescent City and took it to Two Guys. They were very quick and efficient and ordered the part and slotted us into there busy schedule which was very appreciated. Got us back on the road as quickly as possible. Highly Recommended.</Review>

<text>I brought my 1992 Chevy Lumina in with a cooling system problem. I thought one of the fans quit working and was expecting a hefty repair bill. They diagnosed the actual problem as a cracked hose and had me back on the road for $90. I plan to use them again for any future needed repairs.< /text>< pictures>

Had a noise in my front right tire
,of which Two Guys told me
'he couldn't hear it yet, drive it a lil longer til I can tell what it is.
So I drove it til really loud. Was told by Two Guys it was probably this or that and would cost $125 without even putting it on a lift to look at it.
So I got a second opinion in Brookings at Les Schwab, got it on a lift, found out exactly what it was and replaced for less than $100 Yay!<//Text>

<Review>I was passing thru the area with my motorhome and tow jeep and discovered my jeep had a coolant leak.  I looked them up on the Internet and contacted them on my way into town.  They took me right in and discovered my water pump needed to be replaced.  They got me in and out within two hours and back on the road.  All at a great price too. Highly recommend this shop to anyone.<//Review><user_name>John Baker< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

We had an issue with our RV. We called at least 8 auto / truck repair shops and they were all busy. Mike from TWO Guys was too but he accepted to come to the place we were stuck, have a look, reference us a towing company and finally work on it. Thanks guys, we are back on the road< /Review>

<text>This shop is AMAZING! While driving our motorhome on vacation the motorhome developed a nasty exhaust leak. It was unbearably loud. I was concerned it would be very expensive and difficult to fix. I took it to Jay at 'Two Guys' and he had it fixed and back on the road with a custom muffler repair in an hour while my family and I had lunch at Pizza Hut across the street. On top of that he only charged me $90!!  They took a problem that could have made our vacation very uncomfortable and totally remedied it!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I took my car in to get checked over and to replace the rotor/pads before driving to San Francisco and back. Five miles out of town the brakes began shaking badly, and we took it back to them. They told us, it could be the new "Korean pads/rotors" they just installed, they also mentioned the oil was low but didn't fill it. So they didn't actually fix anything goes before I had to go to San fran. When I came back they looked at it for free and said it was, in fact, a misaligned rotor they had just installed.<//text>

Small. 50 guitars. Just enough employees to still be slow, unresponsive, even with eye contact. I always find that weird. I get it.... sometimes I forget I'm at work to. At least ask me why I'm staring at you. And the only reason I'm not saying it...... cause I need you brother. Can't start it off on the wrong foot as a customer. I may have never been told that the floor model amp I wanted to get was literally stacked like a pony wall behind me.
*ok... so I'm not always the shiniest penny in the cup holder myself*
Overall very helpful and I was in and out with what I came for. And I didn't have to enjoy my mask breath for to long. Thanks for hanging in there GC.<//Review>

Do not, under any circumstance do business with this store.  Their confidence in the products they sell ends when you exit the store. They will not stand behind any product they sell including strings.  And the manager Sean is neither customer friendly or concerned about retaining long time customers.  No wonder the company stock is plummeting.  Stay away from this store.

Update:  I have done as you asked.  Let's see what happens.

Update:  Did exactly as was requested of me.  Three days later, nothing...

Update:  It is now 4/26 and the management of this store has done nothing to rectify a defective product.  No contact, no follow up, no concern about a customer.  The polite and seemingly concerned comment in response to this review from corporate is worthless and simply a PR smokescreen.  I will be adding to this review as time goes on.

Update: 5/4/21.  Still nothing.< /text>

<review>It's a great place to come and experience different instruments types of music genres excetera. What do you want to try out one of the new guitars check out The Sound Room get on the drums check out the keyboards. It's also great place to get all your equipment restringing for entire guitars drop it off they have it done pretty quickly. They did an excellent job on my last one. That was fierce pretty cool laid-back seems a little bit cliquish think they could be a little more friendly to people that might not be in the same Realm.<//review>< pics>

It's not a bad place. Just go expecting to get an adequate customer experience. They don't always know everything, most are new, so if you need an expert you'll probably want to ask the guitar tech or your friend who tinkers. I'm usually that guy so I try to boost their confidence at the store, give them hints when they're lost, or give them some positive feedback if they don't have an answer.<//review>

<text>Kind of crazy that a Guitar Center in the desert is better stocked than a Guitar Center in the central valley.  I am not sure how bad the chapter 11 bankruptcy mixed with less people going out is hurting stock or if someone at corporate is just holding back, but this store did not have much available.  Might be better to order off the website or Musicians Friend (also owned by Guitar Center) if you have something particular in mind or order it from the store.  I will say that they did have a fairly healthy stock of acoustic guitars, so they got that going for them.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Product that was sold to me did not work, I wanted to exchange it, but they had none, so I requested a refund, I had receipt.
The kid started giving me attitude for not wanting to wait for the shipment to come in.
I told him I live near Yosemite and it too far to travel back here, he started giving me more attitude saying they could mail it, but mail is not the best up there and I just want a refund, so I can get it at another store, some other customer or off duty employee started putting his two cents in and the sale clerk started to chuckle and said something under his breath and proceeded to give me my money.
What a hassle.< /text>< Response>

< Review>
NEVER AGAIN......I recently purchased a new Gibson Les Paul Studio Guitar from Musician's Friend, which is owned by Guitar Center. The guitar shipped out of Guitar Center in Modesto, CA. The guitar I received looks like a used Demo. model, and it is missing all of the usual Gibson accessories that come with a new guitar. The soft guitar case is also damaged. Everything shipped in a plain cardboard box, and not a Gibson factory box. For a $1,500+ purchase, I would expect a lot better service than this. Buyer beware, this place will rip you off!< /Review>

Im pretty sure it would be a lot better if covid-19 wasn't happening. That at being said they had some nice guitars but some of the guitars were missing a Floyd rose that were hanging on the wall or missing the bottom e string part thats apart of the floyd rose. Some guitars had loose volume nobs. Just wasn't really presentable if you ask me.</text>

<text>When we visited, the normally excellent customer service took a while, but one particular clerk was very helpful once we found her. The store was very busy and the clerk's very busy talking to each other across the store about non-work related things (lunch, parties, etc). Honestly a little disappointed this visit...not up to the usual standards. I only rated it 4 stars because of the one very helpful and attentive clerk.</text>< pics>

<review>Bought my granddaughter her first Pearl drum set. I put it together but never tuned a drum.  I took it into the Guitar Center where they have a huge drum section.Even though they don't have a service department Weston tuned it and set her up for a free intro class. Thanks for a great start!< /review><date>1554127135468</date>< user_id>

These guys helped me get everything that I needed for my home studio and made suggestions where I was unfamiliar and allowed me to make the choice without feeling pressured. I asked so many questions I felt embarrassed, but Shane even took the time to draw a diagram of how to hook up everything!! Talk about exceptional service, well this was beyond that.

Guitar center is what it is they dont  have the top of the line guitars in their store ,but they can get it they they have a large selection but there's no attempt to sell learn products or customer service .it's a warehouse style business everything they carry for the most part will be what's in there 1 year from the. But they make a lot of special orders  nice kids<//Review>

I haven't been to guitar center in a while. If you like full body tattoos and face piercing then this is the place for you. I just needed a guitar patch chord and I stood at the checkout for the better part of a half hour to pay for my guitar chord and I was first in line. There was two guys behind the counter. I was wishing they had self checkout so I could pay and go. I felt uncomfortable and invisible here.</text>

My son has had his bass fixed here. My most recent visit was to get his acoustic bridge reglued, it was a better value to buy him a step up new guitar instead. So that's what we did after my son played them and chose his new model.<//Review><user_name>Melissa Almeida</user_name>< gmap_id>

Sunday afternoon and quiet. Bought a cajon full price that had scratches from being on the showroom floor. I see customers abuse equipment, particularly kids and always think, if I had stock in the company I wouldn't like seeing product trashed and sold for new in this condition. All in all a good experience.< /text>

Our favorite place for all things music. The staff is absolutely wonderful and very knowledgeable, products are almost always available and if not can be ordered immediately. Always a fun experience with the family and I love how kid friendly Guitar Center is, I recommend it to anyone looking for anything musical 😊< /Text>

One of the worst sales persons I've seen in awhile. They just sit around like their waiting on a pizza to show up.
The guy at the drum Department had absolutely no knowledge on anything the girl in the guitar section was the same way seems like they get these people off the street and throw a freaking name tag on them will not do business at that store<//Review>

This place is awesome. Sean is a great manager and has been there forever and mike and jay are awesome. Guitar repair guy is super intelligent and awesome. Other guy with glasses and reddish hair is cool go talk to and DJ piano area employees are always super helpful. Couldnt have asked for a better team. Konnah is the most kind and respectful guy there. Always answers my questions and doesn't get annoyed by me lol. Thanks GC Modesto!< /Text>

They will definitely go the extra mile to make sure you get exactly what you need. Overwhelmingly positive experience especially when compared with surrounding music shops.

I found the guitar I really wanted but it didn't sound quite right, so I looked at a set of fender upgrade pickups. The tech Josh said he could install them for me right away. I didn't even have to ask! That's great customer service! I am 100% happy. No buyers remorse LOL.
Thank you Josh!!< /Text>

If you are lucky some famous  musician might be in shopping when you visit.  Picked up a world class kazoo along with sheet music.  Really wanted to learn how to play theme to the Godfather on the kazoo.  They didn't offer lessons for the kazoo, but they do for other instruments.  I really want to learn how to beat box but they didn't sell them buy they might now so be sure to ask them.

Every musician has a story of a big chain music store that is over-priced and full of rude employees who think THEY are rock stars. (TY Barry Crimins)
But this place is different. You can try Craigslist and drive all over the Central Valley to save $40....but it's not worth the headache. Especially when the seller tells you how well the guitar plays, so you drive 30 miles to find out is a POS.
I've purchased two guitars at GC and am going back this week for another. I love this place. It has a good vibe and fair prices...< /Review>

I was surprised by the disarray of the drum room. The floor was littered with tags and had not been vacuumed in some time. The Roland demo set that I came to see was broken and missing knobs. No service. No one was working in the drum area and music lessons seem the priority as employees passed me by. This was on a Saturday with a few customers.<//text>

They have a great selection of items. The items I have invited a though one of them was mislabeled on the price and ended up being over $4 more then what it was labeled to be and the other items I bought didn't even have a price on them. I'm sure if they organize their stuff properly and had things priced that would be better. Also there is absolutely no staff in the drum area to assist.< /Text>

< Review>
Good customer service (VERY BAD RETURN POLICY I HAVE EVER SEEN). I went to the guitar center today and tried to return an item it was software and the policy states:

(No returns - clearance items, discontinued items, Apple hardware, opened software, software downloads, books, CDs, videos, vinyl records, etc...)

They guy had to go ask his manger and he said we do not take items back that are software. WILL NOT BE RETURING TO THIS STORE EVER AGAIN. If I need anything in the digital world I will take my business else where. Thank goodness we have the internet!!

P.S. STOP SELLING SOFTWARE!!
IF YOU CANT RETURN IT!!

Goodbye Guitar Center!!<//Review>

This place should hire more people! I waited 20mins to get helped. People complained about it as well. You'd think they at least acknowledge you and say "be right with you" these people didn't say a thing! After I finally got helped, she didn't know much about the product! Seemed like I knew more! Definitely walked out with nothing and I'm taking my business else where.< /Review>

I swear the customer service has dropped down so much. People ignore you unless you are trying to test out a guitar or amp and they turn down the volume on you while there are kids banging on the acoustic drum set. Very rude employees telling you to move out of their way instead of saying excuse me. No wonder there are talks of Guitar Center going out of business. I hope they do. Try Reverb or Sweetwater if you are looking for an instrument.<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>What's the deal with Guitar Center employees? They as a company promulgate some kind of elitist attitude amongst employees that is extremely irritating from a customer's POV. Over the years as they effectively replaced Sam Ash for most, I aa well have used them for all of my instrument needs and continue to be one of their customers but feel I must say this: their employees at all locations have a tendency for rudeness. No matter how you phrase your question (whatever it is) they will find a way to make you fewl stupid! Highly recommend.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
The guy that helped me with an acoustic and an electric setup was friendly. Both guitars are in much better shape.

My fender hellcat acoustic had action that was way too high. It's much easier to play after he lowered the bridge, strung up some new strings and adjusted the truss rod. Sustain is improved on higher frets as well since it's way easier to push down the strings. Super happy with this setup.

My Ibanez gio seemed impossible to intonate the g string when I left it and the action was set high to compensate for the last 4 frets not ringing out at all. He straightened out the truss rod, replaced the strings and lowered the action. Sustain is improved across the whole fretboard and the intonation seems to be fixed. There's still slight buzzing when I play hard, but it's a cheap electric and I wasn't expecting there not to be. Probably needs a little fretwork. For $50 bucks the other fixes made it worthwhile.

I'm happy with both setups. Best $110 I ever spent.<//Review>

We had very helpful associates talk to us about a variety of guitars, giving us a better understanding of what is best for our needs.  Also, it is a fun place to try out the instruments and hear very good musicians show off the potential of the instruments.</Text>

Great place! Every GC is worth a stop if you are interested in musical equipment. This was my first time in Modesto's. It's not as big as other GCs but man is it packed! I was there checking out some bass guitars. The great thing about GC is the variety, new or used, and you can try them all out, they don't bother you unless it looks like you need help or you ask. I was just killing some time but I spotted a nice 5 string I might be back for.</text>

<Review>The customer service in this store is not very helpful. Guitar Center products are excellent but every time I go down to Modesto's Guitar Center weather I am making a purchase or calling about a product I always seem to have an issue.

I've purchased an interface that I ordered online and needed to pick up from the store. They couldn't find it. It took them a over a month to find it after the pick-up date. I also had to call them multiple times to remind them of my order. They never called me .</Review>< pics>

Found a DJ controller on clearance and called to have it placed on hold over the phone. Everyone I talked to was always prompt and helpful with my request. The pickup was quick and efficient. Don't know who "Joe" worked with, but my experience was all good.

And honestly, who complains about someone hanging up when a phone connection is bad? Really dude? They obviously weren't "too busy" to try and help you, but if I can't hear what someone is saying on the phone, I'm gonna tell em, hang up, and wait for a call back.

Take your business elsewhere...you'll save all the good working people the hassle of having to deal with you.< /review>

<Text>Store is great. Some of the guys are great. The only thing is, theres a particular group of workers that bad mouth customers. Wekt in the other day to get an acoustic on sale the other say. Dude straight up told me this isn't a good guitar, but if this is all you can afford.. Then basically kept telling me hpw crappy it is amd that I'd better get a warranty.  Not too sure if that's proper salesmanship or hpw theu hook people in. But I'm a regular customer at almost all guitar centers in the valley. This one how ever has great people. But that one bald guy with a beard akd deep voice tries to run the place but is totally rude to customers he don't like. Then his group will remeber the face and they all give non quality help and insight towards something that I wanna buy. He gives me a hard time every single trip to their location. And I kinda don't wanna drive a few hours out to another GC to avoid him</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The workers there act like your bothering them when you need help and when they close if your in buying something they make sure you leave because they are closing. You would think they would want the sale but they don’t they want you out.<//Text>
