Everyone is so friendly and covid-19 safe. Dr. Gordon is very thorough, explains all your concerns and Jessica Segovia is amazing by helping choosing the right frames that actually fit your prescription and enhance your look. Measure twice and order once.
I highly recommend you go see Milpitas Optometric Group.

<Review>My family has been using the services of Milpitas Optometric for many  years. The staff are friendly and professional. Eye exams are thorough and proactive in identifying potential issues. One year, my son's eye exam was done at our health care provider. I was shocked at how few tests were performed and decided we would not go back. Since then, we have only gone to Milpitas Optometric for exams, glasses and contacts. I recommend them to everyone. Recently, I was there for an appointment. Their protocols and cleaning procedures between each client were excellent and reassuring.

We regularly donate used glasses at their office. Dr. Gordon is a member of the Flying Doctors organization that provides free services in some of the poorest countries.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmap_id>0x808fcedf3550cd81:0x2c510acd309e2d84< /gmap_id><name>L R</name>< rate>

I always enjoy my yearly visit with this practice. The doctors and staff are always very friendly, helpful and trust worthy. The Scheduling and check in process was easy. They also did a good job with all the precautions during this pandemic. Thanks again and look forward to seeing you again next year!< /Review>

Every employee I interacted with was extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and they all made sure to sanitize equipment or glasses before I had to touch them. The process felt very thorough and Dr. Stella Ma talked me through the condition of my eyes more than any other eye doctor I've ever seen. I haven't received my glasses yet but so far I would go back!<//Review>

<Review>Before Covid services, they we’re not that great as they were very busy and they never really had time to give you the full undivided attention and help you choose which glasses would look better on you or what prices would be better for you. But since Covid I went in yesterday to try on some glasses and since they didn’t have that many people there they gave me more than enough time gave their all all of their attention to me and the girl was able to help me choose my glasses I believe services have improved even better now that Covid is here otherwise I just be another number like previously<//Review>< pics>

<review>Quick but happy review update: Tina, the manager of the optical department was able to reach out to *local* contacts and was able to reduce the delivery time from 4 weeks out to just a couple of days!  This is why I love using small businesses as opposed to evil corps like Lenscrafters.  Overall I'm very satisfied and pleased with follow up and resolution of my problems.  Don't be afraid to ask if there might be a better solution it there!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fcedf3550cd81:0x2c510acd309e2d84</Gmap_id></record>

I cannot say enough good about this place and their staff. Five stars in all categories: atmosphere, staff personality & helpfulness, the doctor provided the most thorough exam I've ever had, and they even got my order back to me and fitted properly in nearly half the quoted timeframe for completion.
If you skip over this place for another, you will be missing out!!<//Review>

Personnel at this facility was very nice and effective in eye exams guiding me from station to station. They cleaned everything that my body, head mainly,  would get in contact with.
The doctor explained different aspects of eye functionality, how it possibly indicates other health problems in human body. She answered all my questions also recommended what kind of food is beneficial for good eye health.
I recommend this office highly and will return there myself when need be.<//text>

<Review>Milpitas Optometric Group is the BEST! Dr Susan Gordon is who I have seen for years. She is really easy to work with and lets me  know exactly what's going on with my eyes. One year I didn't even have to update my perscription because my eyes had hardly changed at all. They offer a great selection of glasses. I found the perfect pair that I had wanted to get to change my look. I was really excited about that. Everyone in the office is very helpful.<//Review>< response>

I love Dr. Susan Gordon! She is wonderful. She is thorough in her exams, goes above and beyond, such as writing letter for me to take to my ophthamologist. She is sincerely, empathetic and sympathetic! I have now been seeing her for several years, and I hope she doesn't retire any time soon!< /Text>

<review>This has been my optometrist for the last almost 10 years. The service is exceptional. Dr. Gordon is personable and explains everything to you in a way that is easy to understand. I’ve also used Dr.Pham and had the same kind of experience. The office staff are super friendly, from the receptionists to the staff that helps with picking out frames and sizing. Jessica and Shanice (sp) were sooo nice! We were having a hard time finding frames we liked and they helped with a few suggestions. Loved them all and landed on frames they pick and all within the insurance budget! Super score! Will continue to use as my optometrist indefinitely! 👏👍< /review><user_name>Sarah Schooss<//user_name><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Just moved into town and was looking for an optometrist that was close to home. Front desk which was amazing and had me fill out 3 papers. Dr. Lee overheard me talking to the front desk and asked if I wanted to start the exam right away. A+ experience with every team member including Dr. Lee. Recommend to anyone looking for an optometrist. Kind and knowledgeable staff who take care of you.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Pros: My primary optometrist here is  Dr. Lee. He's incredibly personable and informative and I do believe he provides the best eye care.
I do highly recommend Dr. Lee! He's an excellent doctor  that genuinely cares about his patients and his community.

Cons: I am not a huge fan of the front office staff and the office doesn't have the largest selection of frames but what they have is pretty nice.< /Text>< user_id>

May be first and last experience. Was referred to this place by friend. Dr. are good as far as inspection goes. But optical department negative. They are really expensive for glasses, so I thought their service will be excellent as well. I selected and ordered prescription progressive glasses. Their time to get the glasses ate 10-15 business days, that's really long. So when I get my glasses, I realized I am not able to see far sight. The optician, first try to in couple of times and kept me try now thing. Nothing worked, actually the glasses came with wrong prescription. So she said it has to send back to correct it and it will take another 10-15 days. No apology or feeling sorry for this messup. I was hoping best customer service and express service for correction. But no, so still waiting to get my glasses, hopefully will be correct prescription.< /Text>

<text>Charged extra for the use of new equipment that does not make you dilate your eyes (a green light laser scanning device). The office I used to visit had this new equipment, but did not charge extra for the usage of it. Seems counter intuitive that a procedure that is both faster and more beneficial to both parties should cost more. A major disappointment that this was the case. Will be visiting the office I used to visit next time.<//text><user_name>Michael George< /user_name>< rate>

Optometry: I've been going to Dr. Kavanaugh for years.  I feel the staff at Milpitas Optometric Group is friendly and helpful.  I've never had to wait more than about 5 minutes to be seen.  I don't have a problem getting appointments, and I never feel like they are pushing products or services on me.  Their prices are reasonable.

Frame dept:  Again, staff is friendly and helpful.  I always need a lot of advice and opinions before making a frame selection.  You just need to be patient in this area.  There is always a wait to be helped (as much as 30+ mins).  Once it's my turn, I'm not rushed however, so just plan your time accordingly.< /Text>

My family and I have been going to MOG for over a decade. I've moved a few times and still drive out of my way to come here. The staff are not only efficient, they are so friendly, professional and courteous. A nice spacious waiting room, clean bathrooms and lots of frames options.<//Review>

The whole experience was very pleasant and satisfying. I felt catered for right from the reception through examination to frame selection. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this place for  genuine eye care.</Review>

I just want to say THANK YOU to Mary Lou and the group for helping out with my sons contacts.  He left for a watepolo game at Santa Clara without them and they helped us out by getting him replacements fast.  Thank you again so much!</text>

Been going here for 10 years - no problems, and always great service. I love Dr Susan Gordan! She is a careful listener and has helped me get glasses that are great for my computer work as well as for everyday.< /review>

My wife and I have been seeing Dr. Susan Gordon for 13 years and she's excellent.  Even now that we've moved to Pleasanton, we're still coming to Milpitas to see her because she's worth the drive.  The glasses services are also first-rate; I'm always satisfied.< /Review>

Fantastic service! That makes all the difference to me. I rarely post reviews but this place is exceptional. First, I was able to get an appointment after 6 PM which is incredibly convenient for me.  Dr. Lee is passionate about his craft and it shows in his knowledgeability and demeanor. The optician, Cera, helped educate me on exactly what my insurance covered. She let me know that my prescription did not change since my last visit and did not pressure me into a sale. The front staff even offered to watch my small dog while I was in the exam (they remembered that I hate leaving her in the car alone).  You can get your glasses from the same place you buy bulk mayonnaise from these days but it just does not compare to the quality people, service and product that this place offers.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I love this  place!  I moved from this area 5 years ago, but have not had time to find a new eye doctor.  And I don't have time now.  When my husband and I came down recently to this area, I jumped on the opportunity to finally make an appt with them,. I'm so glad I did!.  THis place is professional, but compassionate and understanding.  The eye tech was wonderful!  I cannot see very well with my current glasses, so she helped me to find a new pair of frames.  She was knowledgeable about eye things, she was patient with me, she figured out exactly what I would owe and what my insurance would pay, and she had such a pleasant personality.  And my eye doctor lived up to why I still like prefer going to her, even though she is now so far away. All I can say is, my appt was a very worthwhile appt and I felt well taken care of when I left.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808fcedf3550cd81:0x2c510acd309e2d84</gmapID></record>

<text>Our dinner was incredibly well presented and DELICIOUS. I ordered the dissan and it was one of the lost delicious meals I've had in a while. Great deal for the price. The chicken was incredibly charred, salty and smoky flavored, the sauce was layered, rich, balanced and complex with flavor. The plantains were sweet and well seasoned.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The live bands are great, but the DJ is the bomb ... he plays a wide variety of music.
The live bands are fine ... but the DJ is spectacular ... he plays a wide variety of music ..... This Leonardos is the best of all those who have ever been.

But there in that leonardos nigth club in Los Angeles, the entrance is expensive for the bucket at 50 dollars, nowhere have I been so I don't go back there and I recommend them to all that in other places it is better than there even with vip

(Translated by Google) The worst place to go, as we went to get distracted and rather I almost got hit by the man who parked the cars, he searched my car from top to bottom and since he found nothing, I threw my phone and broke it when I asked where my phone was. subject who is a lioness employee, he told me "old man, you are fine, you are not foolish, I am not touching you, you are a p ^ t @ and so many offenses that I felt so bad and all this told me that I was going to take eggs from the parking lot, I I feel very upset because the owner hires people without education for us, customers exist this business so oh more clearly .....

El peor lugar para ir, segun fuimos a distraernos y mas bien casi me agarran a golpes el hombre que parquea los autos registro mi carro de arriba hacia abajo y como no encontro nada tiro mi telefono y lo qebro cuando pregunte donde estaba mi telefono empeso este sujeto que es empleado de leonardos me dijo " pinche vieja estas bien pendeja yo no te toque nada eres una p^t@ y tantas ofensas que me senti tan mal y a todo esto me dijo q me iva a sacar a huevos de el parking,  me siento muy molesta porque el dueño contrata a personas sin educacion por nosotros los clientes existe este negocio asi oh mas claro.....<//text>

The food was fantastic and the customer service was superb. The prices are very reasonable and i would rather eat here than any fast food chain. I don't live in this area, but i would be willing to make the 2 hour drive just to eat here again.<//text>

I would eat from Burger time in Arvin a million times over any other fast food restaurant in town. The food is GOOD! Stays super busy. The girls that work there are ALWAYS very cordial. Anytime your in Arvin and want a quick & good meal THIS is the spot!</Review>

The food hits the spot when you're in for a craving. The only knock on it would be the no public restrooms situation. They've found a way to stay relevant after rebranding their image and name.
I would highly suggest they install a PA system for the outside or a highly visible order number system since the bulk of orders is outdoors where it can get quite noisy especially with young clientele that like to blast their music from their vehicles.<//text>

< Review>
This spot was actually pretty good considering how it looks and the fact that it's predominantly food that's not very healthy for you. I had a crispy chicken salad that was good. My husband tried the shrinp basket and said it was pretty good. The portion sizes were pretty generous also. The employee who helped us was an awesome young man...very helpful and friendly and we really liked him a lot. It was extremely busy and is obviously a very popular place with the locals and it was very affordable for anyone.</Review>

Good food. Good Prices and always very friendly service. The owner is a great person and so are his sons! I miss Munther the Owners son... He was always so friendly and nice to talk to. I like that it is ran by a Local Family. I locked my keys in my truck one day in the middle of summer and instead of me walking with my 2 kids the owner gave us a ride home while the employees kept an eye on my truck until I got back.</Review>

Great little mom and pop place off the beaten path. Burger combos for as cheap as $5 and includes fries and drink. Friendly people. It is very old and run down which honestly is part of what I loved about it. Definitely not a McBurger experience here.<//Text>

<text>Has good burgers and is very popular among the students at the nearby school and is a good meeting spot as it is in the middle of town. Its prices are ok and has a small arcade. Only complaint it that in the summer it gets hot inside and there is no air conditioning. Good place over all.< /text>< pictures>

The oil that they used was old. The family was very disappointed with the meal. Money thrown away. Oysters were hard and dark brown. Change your grease more often.  Will not never return to the one in Gardena.<//review>

Delicious place of you're craving some of the English pub food! I love the regular fish and chips London combo drenched in vinegar and tartar sauce! There's not too many of these franchises left so if you're in the mood for fish and chips, this is your spot!<//review>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a incredible evening and the place was certainly the reason for the successful celebration. The stuff  collaborated in a sweet style, the cuisine was very good and my guests were extremely  happy. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.< /Review>

<Text>Bomb food. It came out so fresh and hot! Customer service is beyond superb, its like one of those mom and pop places that treats you like family! It's definitely a hidden hot spot in gardena and now is my offical fish spot. Oh and did I mention that it's super affordable too?! 10/10</Text>< date>

<text>I've been there five or six times only one time was good.
I stop by tonight 4/19/19
7:45 pm
By the time I got home to eat my fish and chips and shrimp it was dry overcooked the guy that was so crispy some of it you couldn't even eat and it had to be the worst french fries I've ever had greasy and over fried .
This will be the last time I will ever go back to that H salt it was a complete waste of my money
I could have got a fish sandwich at McDonald's it was cooked a lot better...

The shrimp that came with it too shrimp will for shrimp all together I bought two orders of each two trees combos I'll tell you the shrimp was worse it was like eating crunchy Cheetos

And I don't mind but they could at least turn the Latin music down so customers could hear fish and chips is supposed to be eager Style not Latin Style maybe that's where everything was burned they thought you were making chicharrones</text>< Name>

Afavorite from my childhood.  Ask for the fish extra crispy,  it helps to keep the yummy crunch when you add the vinegar.</Text>

<text>Terrible service.  Tried calling to place my order before arriving  (multiple times) and got no answer. Upon arriving, I stood at the counter directly in front of the cashier who never even acknowledged me for 10 minutes while she prepared someone's order. ( At least let me know you'll be helping me when you're finished or something.) So during that 10 minutes I tried calling to see if the phone there was ringing (and it was). I don't get it? The place wasn't even busy. They ignored the phone the whole time I was there. So I kept calling to no avail. I come here often and this was my 1st bad experience. But it was so bad that I couldn't ignore it. The cashier seemed to not care about her job.<//text>< rate>

Worst food, made my family sick.  When I called to let them know, they didn't offer an apology and said nothing about it.  I believe the food was spoiled and old.< /Review>

Great food in a pleasant place.  Our server was very courteous.  I was also a big fan of the refried beans they served along with the traditional salsa and chips.

The food cost about $5 more than I usually pay at similar restaurants, but that wouldn't be enough to keep me from going back.</Review>

If you look at the picture of the tamale sauce it does not look appetizing at all. Service were really friendly though.</Review>< name>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Delicous. Husband gave up meat for lent and I'm a vegetarian so we ordered fajita taco salads with just beans. The waiter was nice enough to ask the cooks to add on the carmalized fajita veggies and not charge us for regular fajita salads since the expense is for meat we're not eating. The food was exceptionally good. Their house salsa was the best Ive had and the decorations in the restaurant are lovely. If I lived in redding I'd come often.</review></record></dataset><record>

Comically bad Mexican food. Elementary school-cafeteria quality. Cheap ingredients. Their burritos look like something a 5 year old would construct during “cooking with mom” night. Bland. Cheap greasy cheese. We literally laughed the entire to-go meal about how bad everything is....this IS your one-stop shop for your worst Mexican food experience. So bad.</Review>

Authentic Mexican food.  They serve you chips and salsa with refried beans.  And they have the best blended margaritas ! Large proportions.  Tasty food.
Staff is always friendly.< /review>

<review>They serve generous portions, but it is worth it to indulge!  Sharing the combo steak and chicken fajitas is enough for two. Chile relleno, delicious. Don't forget the margaritas served, again, generously in an extra large glass.< /review>< userid>

When we showed up they were very busy and we still didn't have to wait long to be seated. The service was wonderful and the food was great! The margaritas are huge and come with a follow up tequila shot! My first time dining there and definitely not my last👍</Text>

I had originally written a great review but, am now updating because, I started experiencing very bad stomach cramping and diarrhea. My son is experiencing the same symptoms as well. We had dinner there last night and are still sick today. Will never eat here again and definitely do not recommend<//Text>

I was kind of blown away tonight. Arrived after closing. My boyfriend and I stayed in the parking lot to search for another restaurant when one of the staff came out. They said that they were closed, but they had a table that hadn't received their meal yet and invited us in. Let's just say....service, food, atmosphere, you name it, TOP NOTCH!!!! Cannot describe just how delighted we were! Thank you, and we will definitely make this a regular spot!😊😊😊<//review>

Okay, this place was just Awesome!! The food is delicious!! The service was fantastic!! It made the night out with the family just a great time!! It seemed we were catered to. Didnt really have to ask for anything or if we did it was quickly responded to. It can seem to be a tad expensive, but so worth the price for the service along with great food!! I highly recommend giving them a try!!<//Review>

<Review>Excellent Mexican Restaurant.  The servers are attentive. The chips and salsa were tasty but not plentiful. They also give you a bean dip along with the salsa which was a nice touch.  We had tacos which were excellent.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Got a combination plate to go. They don't bother to separate the taco from the rest of the items so you get a soggy taco that you can't pick up and eat.< /text>

<review>The food was at a great price. 4 adults 2 kids for birthday dinner was just about 60.00.. amazing. Food tasted good a little better than the medium.. not great!! Tasting but far from bad. It was clean most eveyone was friendly.  Aver all wish i could give more stars but... we had the worst server. Others helped us and asked their tabkes ifthey wanted more to drink etc, but nit ours he hid out most of the time. We were a party of 15 ppl and we were ALL done and bored before we could pay and it took me getting up goin over and waiting and waiting before i could ask if we would get checks soon cuz wed really like to go home tonight. Eeerrr. So other than him good good good</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We thought wrong. Drinks came in an ok amount of time, food took just over 30 minutes. After the food came we realized we didn't have silverware, that took another 5 minutes to get. In the almost hour we were there no one offered to refill our drinks.</text>< user_id>

< review>
We go almost every Sunday after church with the our kids and have some awesome food and enjoy having Bryan waiting on us. He is so professional and fast on service. We recommend the beef  enchilada plate and camarones mexicanos. The kids get nice portions and have tried almost every meal on the kids menu. Also kids menu items are 99cents on sundays. You also get chips, salsa, and refried beans with tasty white cheese for an appetizer and end the meal with a sweet desert. We got churos and vanilla ice cream last time we went. Go see Bryan and the gang and have a great meal on sundays.</review>

Went with a large group and there were two other large groups already. We were accommodated immediately and service was great and quick. The servers teamed up on each table serving everyone quickly. The food came out faster than expected and it was all good. Not one of us had a single error or issue.</text>

Delicious... The meat was tender and not dried out. It was so yummy. They were very accommodating to my desires of wanting a salad instead of rice and beans. Amazing meal and I couldn't even eat it all. I would go back again.</Review>

<review>You get chips, salsa and bean dip to start! Portions are good enough to stuff a young man and you get a fried tortilla with whip cream and strawberry sauce after your meal.  Good food with friendly staff. My favorite stop on my way home!<//review>< pics>

<review>Very torn on how to rate this. The place is not clean. It's in such great need of a thorough cleaning. The bathroom floors were so sticky I almost stuck to them. The food was ok. The avocado they put on my tacos was old and looked not good. The carne asada mean was good though.<//review><rating>3< /rating>< Date>

The food was great, I had the large combination plate #29 a chimichanga and an enchilada. We got chips and salsa and even a side of beans and cheese with our chips. The atmosphere was festive and the tequila was flowing . It was a little loud for my taste, but that is a matter of personal preference. I will go back.< /Review>

<text>Nice Mexican Restaurant.  The best I have tried in Redding. I had the chili relleno and taco. I thought both were delicious.  My husband had the carne asada burrito and did not enjoy his meal as much.  The waitress was very efficient and friendly.  The atmosphere was kind of dark so I couldn't judge the cleanliness.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I 💘 this place
I 💘 the beans you get with chips and salsa.
My new obsession is the Mexican steak pizza with rice instead of beans😋< /Review>< pictures>

I've been going here for 20+ years and I have been absolutely pleased Every Time.
The service is impeccable, they are: Friendly, Courteous, Prompt and Eager to Please.
The food is always: Fresh, Hot and Tasty.
They have all the Mexican food classics. Children are welcome. They love to host a birthday dinner for any age. Their drinks are also excellent.
The Camarones Mexicanos are so good I have a hard time ordering anything else, and a Tequila Popper always goes well with the bill.
This is always the first restaurant in Redding that I recommend.< /Review>

<text>One of my favorite places usually but my go to meal was different, too many onions cutting back on meat and my husband got the end of the avacodo steam in his food and hurt his tooth and it looked like his tooth when he took it out. Thankfully it wasnt and accidents do happen but this wasnt the first time that we had something in our food that didnt belong< /text>< time>

Frozen desserts were freezer burnt, grilled cheese sandwiches were more burnt then than any Mexican restaurant I've been too. Asked for 3 hamburger patties and they did not have any in the back for me and friends< /Text>

It's kind of pricey for the quality of food. The servers are friendly and fast and the refried beans are homemade.</Review>

No disrespect to the the door guy seems like he has a miserable life. Was there for the fight and was respectful when he said it was full and was waiting for people to leave. After a few parties left, still made myself and another girl wait in the rain when it had way more room to occupy us. He also went out of his way to cover the screens from the door instead of having the respect of people waiting outside in the rain to see the fight. Seems like a nice spot. Door man needs to be retrained. Power trip or just having a bad day I think I have nothing against him personally but having people wait outside when there was lots of room for another party of 8+. When there are people waiting outside that was already inside and need to reconnect with their friends accommodate them. Good luck to you and your business.<//Text>

Brian behind the bar did everything to make us welcome. We just came in as tourists to watch the Ireland Georgia game. Great seats good beer, friendly chat at the bar too with one of the other regular customers. They don't do food - not a problem, we were able to bring in food from the deli on the corner. I will call in again if I am back in San Francisco.  Real people serving real beer in a friendly bar.<//Text>

< Review>
Yesterday my friend and I happened upon this establishment after her fantastic hair appointment.   Kieran the bartender was more than charming and made it the end to a perfect day.  Kieran, if you read this we were the two gals that ordered Titos martinis (cause you had no Kettle one)  cant wsit to go back to this jewel on Haight.<//Review>

<review>My father and I showed up at 330pm looking for a few good drinks and a cool bartender, but instead not one employee was insight-- an electrician had to get one from the back. When we asked if it was open he said "I guess so". I suggest walking right back out of the bar if the bartender is an old, gray haired, frail man</review>< pictures>

Fun place to watch a game (it's known for soccer but any big game is fun). Crowd can be hit or miss (read: sometimes douchey) but the bartenders are always friendly and fair. I've seen a bartender diffuse some heated situations with grace and kindness while still being firm.<//Text>

A well lit, smallish Irish bar is a nice neighborhood where they’ll quickly learn your name and favorite drink. It’s usually not too busy, which makes it a nice place to unwind with friends after a long Friday. But if you come during one of the popular game days, there could be a line well out of the door.</Review>

I personally hate sports bars but I still respect a good one.  DC’s is the sportsiest Irish pub on haight!   From what I can tell, this is an ideal spot if you’re looking to get smashed and watch the big game!</Text>

Little Hawk's Nest, came into town for the Seahawks game and watched at Danny's, what an amazing place to be! 99.9 percent of patrons were Seahawks fans and such a great environment. Locals had fun with the visitors and the staff was even friendlier. Highly recommended :)< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>Fun outpost in the Haight for the Brainstormer trivia empire!

We showed up at 7:15  for the 8 pm trivia night on Wednesday and were able to score a little side table for four.

Standard Irish pub beers ($5) like Smithwicks and Guinness. And since they serve no food (they do sell some chips), patrons know to bring in Rosamunde sausages and pizza from down the street.</review>< UserId.>

Has a bit of an identity crisis, can't figure out if this bar is an Irish pub, dive bar, or a neighborhood bar. Has elements of all, but doesn't execute well.</text>

This is a cheery, vibrant clinic full of healthy women doing great work. I’m an acupuncturist who has worked in chiropractor offices throughout my years and recommend these women with confidence to patients and friends alike. I like that you can sign up for any practitioner and they are all up to speed with access to your chart. My body and nervous system has been really responding favorably to adjustments from their most recent chiropractor to join the team, Rachel Knopf. She’s a gentle soul. Really though, I’d recommend all chiropractors there.<//text>

Dr. Jess and her team are awesome. She's been an extraordinary help in my road to maintaining my wellness.  Smart, compassionate and so much knowledge to share. I highly recommend her. Plus they offer packages to help streamline the cost for those who want it.< /Review>

<name>Morgan Solem<//name><Text>Fabulous all around. I was a chiropractic skeptic before starting treatments at Ginko, but Dr. Jess made me feel understood and well taken care of at every step of the way. I've now been a loyal client for close to 2 years and can't imagine feeling my best without my weekly visits. I've seen both Dr. Jess and Dr. Mandy and know that I'm in good hands with either of them. They've treated me through everyday aches and pains as well as pregnancy and always seem to find exactly what my body needs to feel better. Don't go anywhere else - this is a team of kind, gentle (but strong!), intuitive professionals from the chiropractic team to the office manager to the in-house massage therapist.<//Text>< Resp>

Dr. Mandy talks through her adjustments and explains what she’s doing and why it helps, always imparting some practical knowledge for me to take home.

<Text>From the reassuring greeting of Sonya, the receptionist, to the bodywork Dr Mandy, Ginkgo Chiropractic has been a great place for adjustments. Dr Mandy even cleared an old volleyball shoulder "stuckness" that I thought for sure was going to require some kind of more advanced medical treatment.
Some years ago I had been to another chiropractor and didn't have a very good experience; I walked into Ginkgo with some uneasiness. It's been a great place to go.< /Text>< Date>

The team at Ginkgo Chiropractic and Sensory Center is amazing! I normally see Dr. Mandy; she is always so full of life and puts a lot of care into her work. I like that she talks me through her movements and thought process so I’m never unaware of what’s going on. I started going during the COVID-19 pandemic and I feel safe every time I enter the building since they require hand washing, shoe removal, and temperature checks before you enter the offices. I highly recommend this office< /Review>

I have been seeing Dr. Jess, for over 3 years, and my visits have become a crucial part of my health and healing. I feel comfortable in the space she has created. She is personable, thoughtful and intuitive. I'm also very impressed with how her and the other folks at Gingko Chiropractic have handled maintaining care during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have always felt safe and considered. Scheduling is easy, and I enjoy the moments I get to chat with Sonja, who coordinates clients from the front desk. I would whole heatedly recommend incorporating chiropractic into your life, especially at Ginkgo!<//Text>

Had slept very poorly on my neck one night and woke up with incredibly stiff neck and somewhat shifted jaw. Days later developed intense, severe vertigo and after doctor and urgent care visits, was dismissed as something else and given medication. 2 weeks later it didn't ease and found myself at Ginkgo where Mandy consulted and gave me a full proper alignment...within 5 minutes the vertigo was gone. Continued seeing her for 10 more sessions to rework a lot of the imbalances in these old bones and always felt leaving amazing. Cannot recommend enough!<//review>

I cannot say enough GREAT things about Dr. Jess! I had been to another chiropractor who hasn’t moved a needle when it comes to my posture and pressure in my neck. After Dr. Jess's adjustments I feel amazing: my neck feels free, I feel taller, have more energy, and my head feels lighter.  My yoga practice has improved dramatically since seeing Dr. Jess once a week over several months. Dr. Jess’s knowledge of the human body is incredibly extensive as is her hands-on adjustments. She seeks out the dis-ease and addresses it from the root. I regularly recommended Dr. Jessica Lips and I'm grateful to have found her.<//text>

<UserId.>105683670634549052355</UserId.><review>Wowza is Dr. Jessica Lips at Ginkgo Chiropractic a great Chiropractor! I initially saw her because my neck was getting less and less flexible. She did a full analysis (which included X-rays) and came up with a game plan to address my neck and lower back. I saw improvement in my range of motion within a few weeks. Her adjustments are precise and efficient and feel good (no pain - for those of you who might worry about that) Throw in a nice, bright, clean office, friendly staff, oh and parking and you wind up with an amazing experience with each session. Plus she's a lovely person. Highly recommended !!< /review></record>

Saw their ad pop up on my FB during the time when my upper back was on fire! Been dealing with back pain for decades and finally decided to try chiro. And I made the right choice. I felt a difference right after my 1st visit. Dr Mandy is a professional that is soo great at what she does. She addresses every issue I have every time I visit and always leave the clinic feeling better. Don’t forget that during this pandemic they have adapted to the new norm of sanitation practices and all that stuff so I feel safe everytime I come for my appointment. They also have the cooles receptionists!!! They also have professional massage sessions that I would be trying next. 😊< /text>

My entire family sees Dr. Jess, including my two kids, 4 and 7 years-old, my wife and my mom who is 69. Dr. Jess is very thoughtful and kind with my shy 7 year-old who has made gains following the Brain Tree program. She has relieved my chronic neck pain and helped my 4 year-old who was waking up screaming in the middle of the night with terrible knee pain (turns out it wasn’t just growing pains!). Dr. Jess is an expert at her craft and her care has greatly improved my family’s health.</Review>

Dr. Jess and the entire Ginkgo team are amazing. I have a history of lower back spasms and tightness, among other sports-related injuries. From the minute I walked in, I felt I could relax and knew I would be well cared for.

Dr. Jess took a very thorough history and assessment before performing any adjustments, in order to understand as much as possible my various ailments and the underlying causes. She explained what she was doing, how it would all go, and when it came time for the adjustment, she used just the right amount of force.

I highly recommend her and Ginkgo Chiropractic!</text>

<Text>I have been to good chiropractors and bad/dangerous chiropractors in the past. Dr. Mandy Chan is easily one of the best I have ever seen. She is intuitive and really spends her time getting to know your needs and your body, and caters each treatment to whatever your system needs at the time. She never tries to force an adjustment, which in my opinion is a very important component of providing safe and effective chiropractic treatment. I have definitely noticed an improvement in the way my body moves and feels.

Bonus perks: provides sound effects during adjustments. Also... the hyper volt. Ask for the hyper volt<//Text>< pictures>

Jessica and Mandy are adept at explaining every aspect of the treatments and adjustments. They are both so friendly as is the rest of the staff.  I especially appreciate the efforts through Xrays and diagnostics to personalize my treatment and provide check-ins with progress. It is a holistic practice offering related services, products and practices to improve overall mental and physical health. Most importantly, they genuinely care about me and my partner’s progress. Thanks Jessica and Mandy.</Review>

This is the single best thing I’ve done for myself this year.  I’m not in pain, so didn’t realize how much chiropracty (Is that a word?) could help me.  I am sleeping better and feel stress leave my body at each visit.<//text>

I initially met Jessica at a local business bazaar.  After hearing my situation she referred me to Mandy.  I had been having consistent chiropractic work for 4 years- my first chiropractor retired and the last felt they could do all they could for me- having gone from once a week to once a month after a minor car accident a year prior.  After a few sessions with Mandy, I have now gone a few months feeling great! I am very active person and know that I need every 4-6 weeks for maintenance.  However, the first thing I noticed about a session with Mandy (aside from her darling bows and badass entrepreneurial spirit) was her incredible precision and how gentle she was in her approach.  I have had a recurring shoulder issue- I think due to someone putting their body weight onto mine to adjust- and Mandy is able to complete the adjustment without that area a collapsing, which has resulted in improved stabilization of my body overall.  I am entirely grateful Mandy & Jessica have opened Ginkgo and look forward to sustained health with them for years to come!</Text>

<review>I have been to a few Chiropractors in my life and have never been really sure that they were doing any good.  BUT!  Dr, Jess is a miracle worker.  I had a chronic issue that was not getting better and was seeming to get worse over time.  I took someones advice and made an appointment with her.  I am now a believer.  Do yourself a favor and skip all the quacks out there and go to Ginkgo Chiropractic. You wont be sorry.<//review>< pictures>

Friendly, professional care! Dr Mandy Chan is my Dr. She's very knowledgeable and obviously passionate about helping her patients on thier path to wellness! I have multiple issues. I have had only had 3 adjustments. Between the adjustments and Dr Mandy's advice I'm already seeing a huge difference!  I'm recommending her and the whole team to everyone I know.</review>

I recommend this place to everyone! I came in with a nasty curve in my neck with osteoarthritis and stenosis. I trust Gingko because the ladies here are amazing and their dedication to the craft shows! I appreciate a chiropractor who uses x-rays. I also judge a chiropractor by their attention to fascia affecting the spine and I get the privilege of receiving soft tissue manipulation, Active Release Technique and trigger point therapy before any adjustment happens. I’m grateful to have found this place!

Dr. Jess is a great Chiropractor - I always enjoy seeing her because she helps keep me at my best - physically and mentally. Her adjustments are very comfortable and I can feel that she really listens to my body and knows right where to go. She is also such a wealth of knowledge on all things health and especially nutrition. I don't hesitate to recommend her to any of my friends. I feel a really positive difference in my body and life since I started working with her!</text>

I truly recommend Dr. Jessica. She is great, always takes her time to figure out what is going on with your body and is never in a hurry to see the next patient. I had an awful lower back spasm that did not allow me to turn in bed, walk straight, stand up, etc. I went to Urgent Care to get some Muscle Relaxants. However my wife insisted I see a chiropractor. So My wife had to take me see her for my first appointment. Dr. Jessica took an x-ray of my back showing a very crooked back which was possibly due to the spasm that didn't allow me to straighten it up.  She adjusted me and magically I was able to stand straight and walk. I couldn't believe it. Little by little my back has been recovering to the point where I no longer suffer from lower back pain and I am now back to playing soccer and do boxing. Of course, that also goes along with strengthening your core which is very important to keep up even if you are not feeling pain. Thanks Dr. Jessica!!< /text>

Where do I start.. I wish I had found Dr. Jess earlier! I was having a lot of soreness in my neck and upper back. She told me that the numbness in my fingers may be related to the problem in my neck. She did a thorough analysis, and even x-rays. I've only been coming here about 3 weeks and already noticing incredible differences! She is defintely the best chiropractors I've ever seen. My neck has never felt this good, and the numbness in my hands has gone away!! Thank you Dr. Jess!<//Text>

I was diagnosed with GERD December 2018 and was suffering immensely. I had numerous hospital visits, test yet none of the doctors could identify the ROOT CAUSE of my GERD which was becoming extremely frustrating. After much research I discovered seeing a chiropractor could possibly help identify why I’m suffering from acid reflux/GERD— I then found Jessica’s practice, called the office and became impressed by all the information Jessica was telling me so I set up an appointment. After my first physical examination I found out I have a HIATAL HERNIA! This is one of the first things the doctors should have checked me for yet Jessica was able to find it! I am now on my 10th visit with Dr. Jessica and since seeing her, I’m the best I’ve ever felt since my GERD diagnosis back in December and feel like I’m finally getting back to my life. I still have a ways to go but, I’m just so thankful for her insight and dedication to her practice/patients!</text>

<Time>1504592163869<//Time><Review>I suffered a lower back injury playing basketball a while back. For weeks I could hardly get out of bed, or get out of my car after my commute to work. I would have to slowly get up and stretch for 5-10mins before I could stand up straight and walk. I couldn't even walk normally. Finally I was referred to Dr. Lips by a friend, we met and I told her about my lower back pain and my daily routine dealing with it. After listening to my story Dr. Lips examined me, diagnosed my misalignment, and carefully adjusted my spine and I felt immediate pain relief! The next morning I woke up, was able to get out of bed and felt good as new! I am grateful for Dr. Lips and her healing talents and would highly recommend her to all friends, family, and strangers</Review><response>{'time': 1518639238523, 'text': 'Thank you Robbie!'}< /response>< user>

Then, her personal concern about my health is far greater than other chiros I've been to. Next, she's a good communicator and it's easy to talk with her.  But best of all is her adjustments: after the very first one, my body felt so much more aligned that it was obvious that she knows what she'd doing: my shorter leg lengthened, my hips squared up and my upper body adjusted to all that!! The feeling was wonderful - I just felt more alive, healthy and aware of my body. After my last adjustment, my tight neck felt MUCH looser . . . ya know, like Gumby!!  And from her guidance, I've learned more about how my body should be aligned and what I can do to support that. I highly recommend Dr. Jessica - I've found the chiropractor I want to continue to see!!!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>After looking up some reviews I decided to come to this place and I am glad I did. The workers over there are very nice and very helpful, after smogging my car and it didn't pass they told me what I needed to pass my car. I can't thank them enough for the work they have done so if you want a 5 star place to go to well this is it!! I am sure to come back every time.< /Review><response>None< /response><user_name>EunMin Lee< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None</pics><review>Yarilin and Hector are great! Last week, I went to get a smog done for a county vehicle, but I wasn’t sure if the codes were ready. I met with Hector beforehand, and he told me about the codes and whether or not they all needed to be good to go in order for the smog to pass. I went back later in the day and waited my turn. There were 3 people ahead of me, but the wait was only about 15 minutes. The staff is helpful, friendly, and professional!< /review><response>None< /response>< username>

Great service. They do not repair cars, but they do smog check, title transfers, vehicle verifications, registration, anything you’d go to the DMV for. Would highly recommend this place over the DMV, was in and out in an hour and I had to do every service lifted above. Very professional and friendly.< /text>

Fantastic Smog & DMV services here.  The owner Hector is very honest as well as super efficient / compliant in regard to the State's regulations.  To my surprise, he completed my smog test in less than 15 mins definitely not wasting time like many other places.  He also provides vehicle registration license plate stickers on the spot for a reasonable fee.  I was impressed with all the services listed (see my posted pic) in the event I need something processed quickly.
His company also accepts Samsung mobile pay👍🏽< /Text>

Fast service, (10 min for a Smog check) young owner was incredibly nice, professional, offered me a bottle of water, called the day after to ask about my satisfaction with service.</review>

Everything about this place was great!  Great food, fair prices, interesting menu (with all the favorites), clean/orderly prep and kitchen area, and a super friendly owner!!!  They are hidden INSIDE the Extra Mile mini-mart, with no real signage out front...  But take my word - you won't be disappointed!</text>

Excellent service, fresh bread baked daily. We recommend the Cubana torta, aguas de Horchata and Jamaica. Little Mexico City is a little treasure inside Chevron station. Try this place!<//Text>

<Review>🙌🏼 Torta: Milanesa de pollo (breaded chicken sandwich) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🍎🍊 Jugo Verde (green juice) 🍍🍏🥬

You ever tried gas station food? Me either, until now. This is a restaurant inside of a gas station. My friend took me and I was skeptical af.

Review: The breaded chicken was delicious and crispy, the veggies fresh, the chipotle mayo set it off!

The Jugo Verde was a healthy delightful addition to my meal. The celery was definitely the star in this juice.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809055e0802394cb:0x8f5e76779c16da86<//GmapID></record>

The chicken tastes like store bought, pre seasoning chicken. The sauces have a celery juice consistency and even smell like it.</Text>

This place is an awesome little hole on the wall that I wish I discovered earlier. This is exactly what Ceres is missing as no taco trucks are allowed in town. They have awesome tacos and burritos and the price is lower than the taco trucks in Turlock. They should put a bigger sign outside by Mitchell so people know they're there.<//text>

This dude is the man! Humble and attentive to all his customers! My wife is vegan and he goes out of his way to make sure her food is vegan ready. Food is authentic and amazing!</review>

What can I say I love the tortas from here, can get enough of the banana shakes their just like mom makes them. Good service the guy is friendly and always their to help if need anything I would definitely recommend it to people don't be fooled by the restaurant being inside the gas station the food is good and comes with great service. Sodas and other drinks that are not made you do have to purchase at the gas station prices are ok DNT mind paying for good food.<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Ordered through doordash on Feb 7th. The dasher said he delivered the food but I never got it. I contacted doordash and they told me I would have to replace the order. I also called the restaurant they said the driver brought the food back but they would make a fresh order. The order I got was not fresh, or the ingredients where not fresh. But over not satisfied with the quality regardless if it's the ingredients or the food being the same late order.</Text>< date>

Dont know if it was because i went at 1040am but i got 3 pollo tacos and 3 asada tacos. The meat was so bland all i tasted was corn tortilla. It wasnt the worst taco I've ever had but for sure there was only tortilla flavor.. I tried the meat by itself and it just tasted like it was from the night before and just reheated. Bad texture and hardly any taste. I only went here because of the 5 star review. Ive had 10x better 3 star review taco trucks. Save your money and just go to your favorite taco truck< /text>

<Review>i order all the time through doordash i had an incident today my doordash driver drove somewhere else i was looking at her the whole time through the app when she got home my food was cold doordash didn’t even credit back half the money they just excused the driver that she was supposedly late i called the owner an he was so nice of the whole situation.. Makes me love this place even more the food quality is awesome we love the burritos and quesadillas great taste... I highly recommend this place if you want mexican food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1543878072960< /time>< userid>

Who would have thought - a breakfast burrito withOUT cheese? And could you try a little harder with the "home style potatoes?" Seriously, just a few more mins of cooking & you get these (bottom pic) - NOW they're home-style, since I fixed them - at home!</review>

<Text>As a first time customer I can definitely say the food here was worth it. Even though I didn't order a Mexican plate or dish, they do go the extra step with portions on those. I did enjoy the Burger combos they have here though. Probably one of the best I've had in a while and I would definitely revisit Campos just for the fries alone

Pretty average.  I haven't had anything great but I also haven't had anything terrible.  The fountain drinks are both expensive and they charge for a refill.</review>

<Review>Been going here for many years, roughly 10-15 years (?? I've lost track), love that its pretty much the same crew.  Food is delicious, NEVER had a wrong order.  Gotten a little more pricy over the years but still a good deal (I make the drive from Beverly Hills where I work).  I order pickup usually and its always ready and always still hot. Dined in a few times, and everything is kept really clean! Guys that work here are super friendly too!!< /Review>< name>

I ordered the Super Deluxe burrito and it came with chicken breast ,rice , beans and melted cheese an enchilada sauce.  The portion size was good and it tasted pretty decent and that's coming from a native Texan.<//Text>

Very solid place. Giving It a 4 because I tried the nachos and they weren’t that good, but I am excited to try to carne Asada fries which is basically swapping the chips out for fries. Honestly the chips aren’t that good, that’s all it was. I got the burrito and added fries to it and they were so crunchy and potatoey omg! The horchata was on point as well! No picture, I smashed that burrito😂</Text>

<text>Interesting location, it's right across from a Taco Bell. Anyways, parking was surprisingly easy (paid). Food was greasy, but that's expected. Portions are veryyyyy generous. The guacamole was GREAT! Service was fast and friendly, and the place was pretty clean. There was nothing on the tables and they cleaned up quickly after parties left.<//text><username>Kim</username><gmap_id>0x80c2b97c3d8ac931:0x9eae0393c6b31ea0</gmap_id>< userid>

Not sure if this was an off day or what but my famous avocado burrito was swimming in sour cream with barely any avocados or beans.</Review>

<Text>I love Campos. I love Mexican food. I can eat it everyday. I've been going there since 1975 when I was going to Santa Monica College. Now there is one near me on Robertson and I frequent them often they all know my name. They all serve me very quickly and a very friendly and nice come in and I say hi to George and I also gave Frankie the Busboys there I guess he is the best boy I gave him a guitar because I really feel close to these people they're like family.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><username>Josh Winiarz<//username>< gmap_id>

I have been going here since day one of their opening. Their food is really above par compared to other mom and shop restaurants. The menu reminds me of a michoacan style family restaurant. The super nachos are amazing make sure you order lengua and got myself together as a combo. By the way we are taught down in Jamaica are made on The daily in house. I wonder whose Grandma's recipe they stole for those.</review>

Campos Tacos was the fast tasty lunch I needed. The portion was generous and I was able to make two meals out of it. The place looked a little simple but I think the food would impress any one. It could use a little bit more colorful decor but I would eat here again for sure.</review>

Probably my main squeeze for a carnitas plate.  On the way up Robertson, it is always clean like whistle, the guys are first rate BUT, ok but I want them to be friendlier.  I do.  I also think they should prepackage salsas- it's one of those bars that have tiny containers begging a mess. It's always like whistle though, ok?  The guys, the place- clean. Food is an 8 out of 10 and you guys,  the Jamaica is 10+. Prices are good.  Its serious business. 🙊< /Text>

This has been my go-to place for nachos since I was ditching high school in the early 90's! Campos is a classic west L.A. chain, and the Super Nachos is an awesome amount of food for a great price. Always recommend any of the Campos locations to anyone searching for great local Mexican food!< /review>

I love this Campos! The cheese enchiladas are bomb and the chile relleno burrito wet with enchilada sauce is mouth watering.

Plus the staff is always nice and gets the food out quick!<//Review>

I ordered a burrito and chips with beans and instead of the guy charging me a side of beans because chips comes with the burrito he charged me a nachos with out cheese which are like 4 dollars more instead of the beans side which cost 2 dollar.  Bad service and the carne asada has no flavor.</review>

< Review>
First time here for me, my son recommended we go Herr after his Football practice at Hamilton High School... I got the Carne Asada Burrito, he got the Asada Fries, the little ones got a cheeseburger and fries, and a Bean and Cheese Burrito with Chicken... All good good!!! We will be going back!</Review>

Menudo was good! They forgot our coffees (which were bad), gave us the wrong tortillas, served us on STYROFOAM  (which kills me) but I would go back because it was tasty. Lets not be stingy with reviews here.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The biggest and delicious burrito that I have eaten in all my holy life. Of carnitas definitely. Accompanied with rich horchata water. The service very fast and friendly and with good location. Right in front of a Bell taco so that they realize what is good 😅

El burrito más grande y delicioso que he comido en toda mi santa vida. De carnitas definitivamente. Acompañado con rica agua de horchata. El servicio muy rápido y amable y con buena ubicación. Justo frente a un taco Bell para que se den cuenta de lo que es bueno 😅< /Review>

<review>Its a nice place to get out to. Be carful with the kids because of the homeless secondary problems...... items and things left on the ground!

Beautiful park. You can ride your horses and drive your car through the park. Lots of different tree species and trails, so you're not bombarded with people all on the same trail.</Text>

At more than 3,500 acres, Bidwell Park is one of the area’s largest municipal parks. It offers visitors a variety of outdoor recreation options.

The park’s amenities include a nature center, lake, several impressive geological formations, abundant treed areas, and a popular municipal golf course that’s popular with cost-conscious golfers.

On the weekends during the warm spring and summer months, the park can draw sizable crowds. If you’d prefer to visit when the masses are at work or still in bed, consider stopping by in the morning during the week.< /Text>

It was my first time going and unfortunately we didn't know the pool was opened and didn't get a chance to enjoy it. I love the place. The trails are long and the scenery gorgeous. There's even places that you can still on the banks of the river and cookout and even put your feet in the water. Water was clear and breath taking. Excellent spot for riding horses as well.< /Review>

<review>Bidwell Park one mile is a very beautiful Park! It's also known as lower Bidwell... you have a place to play baseball horseshoes walk or ride your bike you can even go down to the large Creek... There is also swimming if you choose to do so! There is plenty of parking to choose from! There is a set of bathrooms and me there should be more considering how large this place is! That is the only downfall!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Great park especially when it is hot out. Find a picnic spot, take off your shoes and go relax in Nig Chico Creek. Lots of colorful rocks for that rock hound. Many places to meet up with friends for a bbq.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Good place to bike. It has nicely paved roads to bike on. It also has camping sites which would be a lot of fun to go camping at. It has a nice little quiet stream running through the park. The creek is dammed up at one spot which makes a nice swimming pool. So if you are looking for a place to go I would recommend this place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Are you looking to escape the dullness of everyday life? You’re in luck! One-Mile has it all! Come visit our hobo camp. You can actually see a real live hobo bathing in their natural habitat. You can bring your children to Caper Acers and there’s a 10% chance they’ll get poked by a discarded meth needle!!! People rave about taking a dip in our feces infested creak waters! Bidwell Park has it all!!!<//review>

I am very sad to have to post this but it is a safety issue. I have lived in Chico my whole life and have seen this park at its best and unfortunately it is at its worst right now. There are numerous illegal encampments that the City is doing absolutely nothing about. I have done volunteer clean ups in lower Bidwell park and the amount of trash, human fecal waste and drug paraphernalia is off the charts. Many years ago it was a safe place to enjoy with your family and friends. Now it is not a safe place to be at all. The criminal element is everywhere. If you still choose to go, please be aware of your surroundings at all times and don't venture off the trails. Keep a close eye on your children and pets as we numerous discarded hypodermic needles throughout the park.<//review>

Family friendly park shaded by huge valley oak trees along Chico creek. This park earned it's namesake from location, as it is one mile from the historic pioneers' Bidwell Mansion. Surroundings are complete with a swimming area, horseshoe pit, playground, restrooms, and more! Worth checking out, bring the kid's and even Grandma! There is a trail from the estate extending all the way to Bidwell Park Five-Mile that is popularly jogged, walked, biked or skated!</Review>

Plenty of trash receptacles so no reason to leave any litter. On the north side of the river you can drive the length of the park and on the south side you can bike/walk/etc unencumbered.</review></record>

This peaceful paradise which adorns charming Chico, CA, is a sight to behold. The lovely Bidwell Park boasts a natural swimming area easily accessible from several major streets and residential areas. This area is affectionately called One-Mile. Outdoor adventurers will also enjoy the paved road through the park which spans the area along Big Chico Creek. The recreation area has many attractions such as biking, hiking, walking, birdwatching as well as peaceful communing with nature. It is a must-see destination for all.</review>

Beautiful park! There is a biking and walking trail up either side of the creek and the a myriad of other trails in the woods.
There is a herd of goats that help keep the underbrush down and are kept in a fenced in spot.
Of note: there are a fair amount of homeless folks who use the park so don’t be surprised to see them around.</text>

Super clean and shaded by trees which is very nice specially in summer! Grills are provided and trash cans are always emptied.

The 3600 acre park is one of the largest municipal parks in the U-S. It stretches for miles from close to Chico's downtown (One Mile Area) to well up into the foothills miles out of town where nude swimming is tolerated in the cold waters of Chico creek. The park offers miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails and paths some of which are paved while others are dirt and more suited for trail bikes. A portion of the natural creek has been cemented and dammed to create a large area for swimming safely in the flowing creek waters. Bidwell Park is so beautiful it was used as a substitute for the English countryside the 1938 action classic, "The Adventures of Robin Hood" starring Erroll Flynn highlighted by the famous duel between Robin Hood and Little John staged over Chico Creek which is at the center of the park and provides water for the hundreds of stately mature California oak trees and dozens of other plants that make the park so special. If you visit Chico and don't spend time in the park, you are missing the one attraction that makes Chico truly unique.< /Text>

<text>First time visiting this particular part of town! Wonderful Place to get a few nature pictures with the trees and squirrel's also Great spot to take some selfies! The area was clean and very well picked up, really quiet with an amazing view. There was a nice couple having a little picnic lunch on a table and bench, just enjoying themselves! Super little place out in the open air to relax with not a lot going on around you! Great Park to check out!</text>< gmap_id>

One mile is a plush green park where you can go with friends and family for a short or long walk or relax by the creek on the grass. It's also open during the summer to swim and cool off.<//text>

<text>Basically a huge toilet for the homeless and a hot spot for the troubled in Chico. I have found unimaginable things in that water.  If you chose to swim there in the summer time, i believe thursdays they clean it so go that day or friday. Or just go to any spot just upstream of the pool at one mile.   At any rate there are deep spots everywhere so watch your kids.< /text>< pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Huge park, excellent place for exercise, play, swimming in summer months, or just a pleasant walk. So peaceful and beautiful. My family of six often come to the park for all these reasons and I look forward to swimming soon during summer. Largest freshwater pool with lifeguards on duty I have ever seen and it preserves the natural landscape and wildlife along with the amenities you would expect at any public park. Get out there and check it out!<//Text>< user_id>

Who doesn't love one-mile? It's the go-to place to swim and the atmosphere is so Chico! Great spot to chill, swim, play, and people-watch. I'm obviously writing this review for folks whom have never been to Chico during the warm months. Cuz if you've been to Chico for more than 12 hours in May through November, then you know about one-mile. The reason it's called 1 mi. Is because it is one mile from Bidwell Park's central park in downtown Chico. There is also five-mile . Can you guess why it's called 5 mi.?</Text>

<Review>I found plenty of pennies to eat. And many fun times with scaring children and adults with my water cosplay.

I was in the lake and it was very cold, but fun!

Thank you one mile, very cool!< /Review>< Pictures>

One of the largest municipal parks in the state. Lower park is more "civilized" Paved roadway, large pool at 1 mile 6 mile loop open to cars. Upper park is more natural, lots of hiking trails. The north side is off leash for dogs. The lower park is only off leash to 8:30 in the morning.< /Text>

Cool and relaxing place to bang your girl. Multiple places to walk and many blind spots. So if your girl is looking for a little excitement. Well this is the place to go for a quickie while your in town. Lol</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My boyfriend took me here on our second date. We came for a picnic in September when it still felt like July. We ate under the trees, watched other people seek respite from the heat in the shade, the kids swim in the natural pool, and enjoyed the overall languid, California summer feel.

The park is a great space, with a lot of different options for different activities--swimming, walking/running, lounging, you could even set up a slack line between any of the large oak trees if you were so inclined.

A beautiful space that I now have wonderful memories of...go create some of your own!< /Review>< Pictures>

Big beautiful Park.  I like the fact that they send goats out to eat down the weeds every year instead of using pesticides where you take your animals and children!  It's a beautiful 5 mile walk or bike ride on Trails as big as roads with no cars to worry about.</Text>

This could be one of Chico’s Crown Jewels, but because of lack of funding or poor decisions, the sidewalks and bathrooms need better cleaning. The lawns could be a beautiful area to lay down a towel to rest, read or picnic, BUT there are so many large bare patches that are muddy in winter and spring and just plain dusty and dirty in summer and fall, that it is an unpleasant eyesore.< /text>

Little Chico Creek runs right through here as they have made a pool around it. There were life guards on duty today which was really nice. If you have kids, this is the place to be to cool off.</review>

This could be one of Chico’s Crown Jewels, but because of lack of funding or poor decisions, the sidewalks and bathrooms need better cleaning. The lawns could be a beautiful area to lay down a towel to rest, read or picnic, BUT there are so many large bare patches that are muddy in winter and spring and just plain dusty and dirty in summer and fall, that it is an unpleasant eyesore.</text>

Dirty. Practically a homeless camp. Lots of criminal activity and drug use. Don't bring your kids here. People bathe in the water and there are camps up stream.<//Text>

Very Huge. There is a ton of Nature to see. A lot of paths to walk. A public pool. A Playground called Caper Acres for the kids. A Snack bar and restrooms nearby the public pool. Please Note: There is sometimes Homeless people roaming and "living" there.</Review>

We were going to swim in the evening, but decided not to because of the coldness of the water. Many loud, overtired children were there, monitored by parents who wete zoned out on cell phones. The garbage cans were overflowing, and there were lots of homeless people digging through them. We saw no park police. The bathrooms looked like they had not been cleaned all day.<//review>
