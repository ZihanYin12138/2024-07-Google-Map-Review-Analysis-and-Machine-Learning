<Response>None</Response><Review>I called to set up an appointment, but when the phone was answered, I was Rudely told the machine is broken & he doesn't plan on getting it fixed,
So then I asked him what I'm supposed to do with the Groupon,
He sighed & said Trade it in for something else..
That's fine if you cannot honor your gift certificate, but you don't have to be Rude in doing so,
Is this how your shop is ran ??
Maybe I don't want to try out their store for any other Service...
So Hard 2 Find a Quality Shop Anymore !!!

My homeboy told me about this place and I'm happy I went. Very friendly positive attitudes and it took less than an hour for them to put my new muffler on. I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to any and everybody. Thanks again👍<//Review>

<text>I had an emergency exhaust issue having to do with thieves take trying to take something that wasn't theirs. I told USA mufflers about my issue and they responded promptly and told me to bring it in immediately. They fixed my problem very quickly & got my muffler and catalytic converter patched up and installed back where it originally was without breaking my pockets or Bank. USA mufflers is very professional and gets the job done.< /text>< time>

** BEWARE -- This is not a place to take your vehicle, shady stuff going on. **

I had a groupon for a 4 wheel alignment. I called them yesterday and they stated to come in today at 2PM. When I got there, I was informed the internet was down and they could not complete the alignment. I have the ability to work remotely so I let them know i'll work from their lobby and if the internet comes up that is good, but if not, i'll return another day.

Towards the end of the day at 4:45PM, the technician comes back into the lobby and states the internet did not come back up and will have to try another day. I was ok with this as i took the chance of it not coming back up.

When I asked for my keys, the technician went into the garage to retrieve them and then told me that my front two windows are completely down and that it just started raining. I told him i NEVER leave my windows down especially on a rainy day. He then said... I'm just letting know as to imply that i left my windows down. The car was completely drenched on the inside. In addition, my two hubcaps on the passenger were not completely secured and they were just hanging on there partially secured.

I can't help but wonder 1) why did they put both windows down, 2) what work did they really do by taking the two hubcaps off and 3) there was no work authorization form completed? If their internet was down, there was no reason for them to even get in my vehicle....

I cancelled the groupon and will be taking my business elsewhere. I've always been the type of person to support local business, unfortunately this is not one of them.

Took my 03 Excursion in for a front alignment. I knew it was a little off, after these fine folks got done I realize by how much it was off! They got the big beast feeling like its riding on rails.

Excellent service, excellent attention to details, locally owned... what more could you want!! Will be back for some other service items! Trustworthy and honest!

Brilliant!! Keep up the great work!</text>

<Review>Called to get an estimate for a tune up for a 2012 hyundai sonata, I couldnt get a straight answer on the price, he was all over the place from 3-800 depending on what it needed.
Its sad to see shops that rip people off, based on reviews I cant imagine what the charge would be once they get you in the door.
I found several places nearby and got the work done for $180, no suprises.

< review>
This is a very nice and noligable muffler shop. My wife needed a muffler on her car.. They new all the parts I needed and had them in stock..the price quote was very fair. All employees were neat clean and polite. I made a appointment and will update after install. But from what I experience this day and saw what kind of work they did. Noligable nice caring people and quality work on other installs.  I believe that I will not change a word and will keep this at 5 STARS. If you are In need of a muffler or other work I recommend this be your 1st. Stop. UPDATE AS OF 06-26-2020. I have been back here 3 times since my 1st. Review for some other muffler work and it's exactly as I said before I donot change a word. I will be back again. Keep up the great work...........</review>

I called around and got some quotes on a rear brake job for my truck.  I asked about time frames and prices.  I made an appointment because they were reasonable and timeframe fit into my schedule.  I arranged for a ride for me to be picked up, a ride for my daughter to her job, and ride back to pick up the truck.  I get there and was told it could take all day, I was also told the the price could be 100 dollars more. That so many things can go wrong. I am sitting there with tears in my eyes from disappointment. My ride was waiting for me and because I cried and questioned they in turn said they didn’t want to work on my truck.  Well I hear they do great work but they definitely need to work on customer service.</text>

I visited location with no appointment and was greeted by friendly staff immediately and got a diagnostic quickly.  My car was fixed on the spot and didn’t have to bother with dropping it off and picking up at a later date.  I was in and out!!! Time is hard to come by, and Automotive USA saved me a lot of time and hassle;  making my visit effortless .  Thank u!<//Text>

Worst customer service experience in my life when coming back to fix a problem with labor and work. I truly thought they were a great company when it came to deals, customer service until I had something wrong. So the first visit for my breaks/ rotors went great. I even recommend them to friends. However my breaks where done on 11/27/17 and I went back on 01/23/18 . Since parts and labor where 90 day warranty after front knocking when  pressing breaks. I had already paid for a previous place to look at my car (not touch breaks because I didn't want to void the warranty) the owner I believe his name was Robert. He then tells me if he has his guys take a look, if he doesn't see it or think there is a problem then would charge me for labor.  I feel as a owner you would want to help and have customers return. I guess someone people just chase the dollar and don't actually care about having a credible company. When I ran or managed I always had higher business standards for myself.. different business morals... however if you decide to use them/ save with a deal Groupon good luck because you get what you pay for in the long run. If by chance you have any issue. The owner won't work with you at all.</Review>

<Review>Skilled Techs, professionals, down to earth, Keith is a wizard in the shop. These guys do great custom work, multiple lifts and bays to get work done quickly and effectively. They carry a lot of specialized equipment to get jobs done that other places cannot

Rob is reasonable with pricing, he not out to scam like some other shops in the area.

Location has plenty of parking and spots in the back in case the car needs to have major work done.

They do Transmission services

Rob has the Hook on the MMA too</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809ade9e7312f27b:0xf14beae121fa3a5c< /GmapID></record>

Not very good service when you call and ask if they can look at your car, say "yes, we're open till 5:30;" show up before 5pm (same day) and it's all locked up and no one is around.... They may have five stars from everyone else, but I can't give five stars if you don't even operate with the hours you told me just hours earlier on the phone. If you can get seen by this place I hope it's a complete 180 from my service.</Text>

Where to start? I bought a Groupon for front and rear brake pads with tire rotation. Called to setup the appointment and was told I would need another $90 plus dollars tacked on due to SUV size charge and a special kind of brake pad. I agreed and made my appointment for 9am on Saturday. Showed up to the shop, no one was there. Shop was locked. Called after 10 minutes and it went to voicemail. Then I get a call from Jason, the gentleman that I initially spoke with, that he is going to be there in 5 minutes. He showed up at 9:20 and said that "he had a rough start that morning". I leave him my car and my friend and I leave. I get a call 30 minutes later. He can't do my back brakes because I have City lock and he needs a special tool for that. He knew what make and model and year my car was before I came in, a week after I scheduled my appointment, he could've done his research and looked up the specs on my SUV or asked me originally as I know my car as City lock brakes. I say ok, well please just do the front ones then. Another 20 minutes he calls back and says it isn't my brake pads it my rotators and those need to be replaced, but again he can only do the front ones. He also would have to put whole new brake pads on. Now my quote has gone up, on top of my Groupon, another $200. I tell him I'm going to come get my car and I do not want him to do anything. Legitimately the whole situation was unprofessional and I lost two plus hours out of my day because he didn't bother to do a little research before I brought my car in. He seems really lazy, especially when he couldn't be bothered to even show up on time to his own place of work.<//Text>

<review>To the Management and Staff of Automotive USA:

Thank you for the excellent service you gave to my Pontiac Sunfire.  I found the experience to be fast and cost-effective.  In the past, I've gone to garages who would take advantage of me by adding unnecessary services to inflate my bill.

I will gladly recommend this establishment to anyone I should come into contact with.

Sincerely,

Robert Lindey, Jr.</review>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Sadly I can't even give this place 0 stars or else I would.  I found this place on groupon and seen all the reviews so it looked like a good place to go to but that was not the case . I was told to come in at 12pm for my front brakes to get replaced I was told $30 more for the better brake pads which I was fine with.  I understood that only one person was working so I had to be patient but it took an hour for him to even touch my car. Then he said i needed new routers and he gave me a price i said no problem let's do that.  Then about 2 PM he said my car was almost done.  Then by 2:30 PM he said my brakes were not working at all and that he was going to bleed my brakes and see if that works.  He only bleed the front and then said it did not work and that I needed new boosters then said calipers so at this point i was upset and was trying to figure out how much everything would cost me and what was going on . I then called for a ride and my friend is a mechanic and once he got there he asked the guy what he did . The employee jason couldnt even explain what he did or what was wrong.  I no longer wanted him to work on my car . He then was rude and proceeded to try and charge me so I guess he talked to the owner and the owner said not to charge me.  So he acted as if I then owed him something.  I had to pay for my car to get towed to another shop which cost $100 and then they did a full diagnostic and fixed my car all he had to do was properly bleed all of my brakes that then costed me $120 . I dont appreciate that he tried to charge me for parts and services I did not need.  And i spent 6 hours at that shop when i didnt have to . In the end my car got fixed and I will never go to this shop again nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

I'm not really the greatest customer when it comes to auto repair. I've been jacked by too many places. At Automotive USA, both Robert and Mike were honest and knowledgable. They took care of me from start to finish. More importantly, these guys know how to treat there customers. I won't go anywhere else from this point on and I'm coming from Elk Grove but it's worth it. Oh and free wifi, video games for the kids, GREAT COFFEE and just plain fair and honest business.<//review>

<review>These guys are a step above! I came here to get smog ready and I received just that. I had a bad o2 sensor, that they replaced durring inspection they noticed that my vacuum lines were bad, oil was low and transmission was low. They took care of all my loose ends that were not required for the smog and topped my fluids free of charge. Thanks guys.

Just stopped bye with my wife to purchase a $37.00 bottle of Basalmic. We've shopped here numerous times, for ourselves and gifts for friends. My wife went to the exact location of the product, pulled out the front bottle and grabbed the next one in line. You would have thought we got caught trying to steal it. The owner wanted to know what was wrong with the first bottle, my wife answered she wanted the 2nd one, no reason!! The owner retsponded that they were all the same and the first one was just fine, and on and on and on. We went to pay and as he continued to question why my wife too the 2nd bottle, my goodness!!! it's self serve let it go. As I got my change she was still yammering about why we took the 2nd bottle. Well let this review be a record that we will never set foot in your store again!!! So much for buying LOCAL, enjoy harassing the tourists because I'll steer everyone I know local to stay away.......thanks you made a simple purchase very painful !!! Ugh<//review>

<Review>Amazing store with great products! I love the body products, and they are great for my extremely sensitive skin. The olive oils and balsamic vinegars are the best around! The owner is amazing and takes people’s needs, and health/wellness into consideration. It truly is a wonderful place!</Review>< Rating>

We go to this place every time we visit Tahoe. They have a variety of flavored Olive oils and balsamic vinegars, all high quality. They also have suggested pairings of the two for dressings or other cooking needs. There's a selection of other specialty good items, like flavored honeys. The staff is helpful but not intrusive. I've been very happy with my selections over the years.</Review>

<Text>This place is an experience, not just a store. The lady there introduced us to different oils in combination with flavorful infused balsamic vinegars and they were taste explosions in our mouths. I flew here and can't take any on the plane so I bought 6 and had them shipped home. Wow! I cannot wait to get home and cook with these! 🌶< /Text><response>None<//response>< pics>

LOVED this place and I have been in a lot of olive oil stores.  The salesperson suggested pairing a Tuscan Herb Olive Oil with a Cranberry Pear Balsamic vinegar.  Well, to say we are addicted to that combination on our salads is not an exaggeration.  Giving it for Christmas gifts to everyone this year!< /text>

<Review>Excellent customer service and truly one of the highlights of downtown Truckee! We grabbed one of their amazing honey (Idaho snowberry) and one of the delicious olive oil/vinegar mixes for a salad.  A huge recommendation from us.  There is a reason this is a five star place.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Went there today for 2nd time to give the place a second chance. Both my visit no soap, no prewash. Just water for all the selection. And not sure if they're suing waste water cause water leaves harsh stains. I won't go there even for a free wash.</Review>

I used to love this car wash but a new trend is occurring. People who wash their car are staying in the wash bay to dry their car. They see you but the continue wiping down their car even if all the bays are full. Last time I went three bays were occupied in this manner and since there's no attendant on duty, they feel indignant if you ask them to move.

I will be using other locations instead.< /review>

Not every option works from the car wash. Machine only gave me 4 dollar coins instead of 5. Drug users and drunks hangout at the back end.<//review>

My daughter and her nanny usually come to Peek-a-Boo Factory every Monday morning and also get to attend their free music class. Last Monday I went there for the first time and now I know why my daughter loves this place so much!!! there are so many things to do(tube slide is her favorite) , the music class was very fun , too. I am just glad that they have it there. It is very nice to watch everyone having fun there. The young lady who was working on that day was very nice and super organized. She gave me a tour of the whole place and told me about their party packages. I am thinking about hosting a party there for my daughter`s birthday.
P.S. The bathrooms were clean and thumbs up for a free covered parking. :) cheers!<//Text>

<text>Clean, easy covered parking, great for bad weather. Weekend hours should be longer for open play in the evening but otherwise it's great.

Been going to the since they were at West Portal in SF. This is a better location. Some people abuse the PRIVILEGE of eating in the parents areas which may ruin it for others. Those people need to clean up after themselves otherwise the owners could take away that nicety. Other places don't let you eat inside the facility.</text>< gmap_id>

I love this place!!! And so do my kids. Fog City/Daly city is always cold so this is where we go to get our kids worn out playing.  There is a separate area for little ones and HUGE area for big kids. Its clean, well lit, and has snacks for the kids. A definite must visit for those cold or rainy days.< /text>

Great indoor playground. Kids love the play structure, both toddlers and older kids. Healthful and unhealthful snacks and drinks available.< /Review>

Such an awesome spot for both our 2yo and 5 yo esp on chilly, rainy, foggy days.  Love their new location.  Easy parking, large space with tons of activities.   We buy a multivisit pass and it is a great way to get kiddos exhausted pre naptime.  They also have an excellent,  seperate but adjoining party room for birthday parties.  Clean,  well appointed and most importantly nonstop fun.< /text>

This is a good place to come, if you want to tire out the young ones. My 4 year old and her cousins had a blast.<//Review>

<Text>Although its a fun place for kids its a bit chaotic.  There is a raft area that gets too crazy and there should be a staff person there directing and keeping things in order, there was already two incidents that happen there were parents got into arguments because of the raft.  Staff came off a bit racist due to how and what they said during one of those incidents. Even though it was the other person fault they still favored them< /Text>< Pics>

Cheap, Cheap, Cheap Price compared to other parking. I had a great experience using Fly N Save for our last trip out of Oakland airport. The shuttles picked us up & dropped us off very close to our vehicle even though we were in the back lot. The drivers were very courteous.
On our return, I called from baggage claim after retrieving our bags & the shuttle was at the pick up point within a couple minutes.
Checking in & out of the lot was easy & there were no surprises with pricing. We would definitely use Fly N Save again.< /Text>

💯Wow! Really nice people. The parking lot felt secure, 24/7 shuttle service to Oakland Airport is a big deal! Our flight didn't come in till after midnight and there was a lost bag so after 1a.m. they came and picked us up! And because it was within a reasonable amount of time of my 24 hours of pick up, they did not charge me for an extra day!

Really nice shuttle drivers both on the way to the airport and coming back. I would definitely recommend! 💙 My only sad is that I did not have cash to tip the shuttle drivers!!< /Text>

Fly N Save is a good parking for the low price they offer. Very much what it set out to be. Easy to and from the airport with a clean and new shuttle. Worked well and was cheap. I'd park here again.<//Text>

<text>The lot is a little out of the way from the main streets to the airport, but no problem with the ride to the airport. Coming back, I had to call twice to get a pick up. The lady was completely rude, and told me that "you wasn't there" when the shuttle came by. They were many of us waiting. Rate is good, but customer service needs to be polite.</text><GmapID>0x808f85a2a63cf363:0xd4d051040039e59e</GmapID>< user_name>

<text>Excellent.  Much lower price than other nearby off-airport parking.  And honest pricing, all fees included in posted prices.  Prompt pickup and dropoff whether going to airport or coming back to parking.   Friendly staff.
They have become my go-to parking spot after trying several others.<//text><Date>1574785742579<//Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

Once I landed last night, I called 3 times with no response. I tried checking the live tracking of the shuttle and it said the shuttle was not running. I ended up calling a Lyft to take me to fly n save.

First, the company has terrible customer service and I told myself last time that I wouldn't use them again, now I for sure won't. Last time I used them, I called for pick up. It took double the time as what navigation said was the drive time and I called when I was at the curb already and the live tracker wasn't working . The lady was extremely rude when I dropped off my car. I had used them several times prior. I would park my car and walk to the front where there was a waiting area, sitting bench. She yelled to me that I had to wait by my car, otherwise, how would the driver know where I was parked. ( I always write the # on my ticket which clearly wasn't even needed for the driver this trip since they didn't pick me up anyway)

This trip I called when I landed at least 3 times with no answer. They should at least have an answering machine with instructions for after hours customers. I ended up calling a Lyft and was frightened I was going to get there and they would be closed since I couldn't get a hold of anyone, even though the site said 24 hours. He called back after but I thought it was my Lyft calling letting me know he arrived , but didn't leave a message. When I got there he said he had gone to the restroom and that the phone didn't reach to the back of the lot.  The people working the lot are rude, the only decent/ nice staff is the drivers. I couldn't even find an email for their customer service, if you have it, I would love to forward this to them.</review>

Adequate parking service.  If you’re in a rush to get picked up and returned to your car, go with a different company. They never seem to have an adequate number of vans or drivers for pickups.</review>

Wow, awesome service so far. Showed our pre-paid reservation at the gate, got our ticket and the agent called the shuttle to follow us to our parking space and they picked us up right away. That is a game changer for traveling with kids and all the baggage it entails!

Our shuttle driver was professional, helpful and friendly. The shuttle ride to the airport hardly took any time at all. We’ve tried several airport parking lots and this was by far the best including the on-site lot! We’ll see how pick-up goes on the return trip but so far I’m very impressed.< /review>

A DISORGANIZED MESS!! Parking lots are simple things and hard to mess up or make into a bad experience. That said... When we left our car, everything was fine. But when we got picked up... The shuttle took twice as long as any other shuttle... The shuttle had a propane leak that the driver was joking about with his fellow drivers.

When we were ready to leave, the man in the kiosk was on the phone and waiving his arms and trying to talk to me... I waited for about five minutes confused if he was waiving me on to leave or if he needed to check with me first. He was too busy on the phone to actually address me. When I began to leave, some other employee came out from behind the kiosk yelling for me to stop. Apparently I did need to check in before I left!

I gave the lady my green ticket and she asked for my reservation. I had printed it out and it was kept by whoever checked me in when I first arrived. The lady didn't like hearing that they kept my reservation paper and I had to ask her to check the kiosk... Where they found my reservation.

All said and done, the parking lot was, as expected... Just fine....

But the employees and customer service leave little to be desired. When you're dealing with tired travelers, pay attention to them!

I will not be returning to this lot and am l very frustrated with my experience.< /Text>

Park Fly & Save is a good budget option for parking at the airport. Find their website and book in advance, putting down a deposit. With taxes and fees it came out to just about $10/ day. (The advertised $5.95 I first saw was without those.)

I had to wait for about 10 minutes for a shuttle to pick me up, but it dropped me off right at the terminal. When I returned to the airport and needed the shuttle, I just missed one and had to wait about 15 minutes for the shuttle to come around again. (I believe this lot has just one.) As everyone had been waiting for 15 minutes, the shuttle was extremely full, to the point where half the riders were standing for the trip back to the lot.

When we arrived to the lot, I disembarked, found my car, drove to the exit, and paid the remainder of my balance. However, the majority of the people from my shuttle were standing around waiting. They had evidently taken a different reservation approach and their cars were valet parked, meaning they had to continue waiting for their cars to be brought out. My advice: Don't go for that option.

Overall, a convenient enough parking option at a rate much lower than on airport parking.<//review>

<review>The lady who was working the attendant booth on the morning of 5/22/18 should be terminated do to her attitude as there was absolutely zero service from this person and shotty as all. We had previously parked in this facility twice prior to go on trips for weeks at a time and never had issues until that morning.
Do not use this company for the mere unpleasant experience you'll encounter.<//review><username>Wayne Bright< /username>< user_id>

I've used them before during normal daylight hours and they were good. The second time I used them I specifically told the lady that we would be arriving at 2:30 a.m. on November 22nd Thanksgiving day. I wanted to make sure they were open 24HRS so I wouldn't be stuck waiting for their shuttle. When I called after arriving at the Oakland Airport no one would answer the phone. The third and fourth time I called I got some ridiculous computerized message came on that asked me for some verification code. We were forced to take an UBER to the lot only to find the attendant there at the booth. He had the audacity to tell me that I hadn't called because he was there all along. He went on to tell me that perhaps there was something wrong with their system. You would think that he would at the very least offer to take us and all of our luggage to our parking space since it was raining but no such luck, he jumped in the van and drove off. It was apparent that he was by himself and had to do everything. This company needs to get their priorities in order and provide better service.

<userid>111977837317784991435< /userid><review>This was the worst experience of my life!  I landed at the airport an hour late, called for the shuttle and was told it was on the way.  This business is 5 minutes from the airport so after 20 minutes, I called back and the guy was beyond rude and said "it will get there when it gets there" and he hung up on me.  I called back 10 minutes later and said I was still waiting and he hung up on me again!  My daughter in law called from her phone and he said "stop calling" and hung up on her.  The shuttle finally showed up after 40 minutes and was now full of 11 other unhappy customers!  When we got to the lot, I was dropped off at my car, went to leave and the attendant had locked us all in the lot and said he was now off duty!  I told him I pre-paid and said I would like to leave please and he got very rude once again and went into an office and ignored the line of people wanting to leave.  After 10 minutes the driver of the shuttle came up to the booth and started processing people to leave.  I arrived at the shuttle stop at 12:55am and left the lot that was 1 mile away at 2am - totally unacceptable.  I was held against my will in a locked parking lot and will be contacting a variety of sources to make sure this doesn't happen to any other people< /review>< Date>

Upon arrival at this lot, I was told they do not offer shuttle service, instead have someone there that could take you to airport for 5$. Completely ridiculous for a self-acclaimed airport parking lot that does not offer shuttle service. Worse, there is no mentioning of that during reservation online. Completely a bait and switch business.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I use fly n save every time we fly out of Oakland. Staff is courteous. I usually prepay. Depending on how full the parking lot is I either park the car myself or FnS valets it. I print the receipt at home and have never had an issue checking out.
My one complaint is the size of the shuttle: it's a small van, not like the buses the other companies use. There are 5 in my family so things can tend to get a little tight. Just something to consider.< /Text>< pics>

Pretty easy to use. Shuttle service was relatively quickly on arrival and already waiting when we returned. Reserve online for better pricing.</Review>

I had to get my car towed home. The next day I took my car to auto shop to find out that my car had been hit, and whoever hit my car while I was parked at this place cracked my radiator, and dented my bumper. My car is mess up and I am very upset. I will never park my car there anymore. This is going to cost me over $2000 or more to get my car fixed if my insurance does not help me get this fix. My car is new so I know I did not do anything like this. Not only that but the customer service is not good at all. I went to pay for the service the lady told me $99.80 was my total. I gave her a $100.00 bill, she said I don't have any change, but then said I have change. They over charge me as well. Not a happy customer experience.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< date>

Got picked up directly at my car, didn't have to wait in the rain. Return shuttle was at the pick up area before I even had a chance to call for pick up. WOW, that is great!</Review>

This is the worst experience I have ever had with a "park and fly" lot - anywhere. It took 40 minutes and three phone calls for them to show up at the airport. Then they couldn't find the keys to my car and when they finally found the keys, they could not find the car. This all happened at 10:30 at night - not the way I want to end a trip. I called the manager on Monday to complain and ask for a refund - two weeks later I have never heard from her and every time I call she's not there. No surprise there!! I would recommend that you NEVER use this place!< /Text>

<Date>1478223295495< /Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>After parking in this lot for over 10 years I have finally had it. The reservation system is TERRIBLE. In the past I was not able to log on and had to call for assistance. They could not help and just ended up giving me the internet rate. Other times I would book and get no confirmation and also would have to call.

Recently, I had to leave for a funeral and I, like many others, made a reservation online. One reservation for a family member and one for myself. Upon exiting, my family member was able to get the online rate by showing confirmation email. and then when I came right behind I could not find my confirmation email. They know me and also I have spoken to the manager on occasion. They insisted on my paying full price even though they knew I had just booked an online reservation for my relative and also for myself. I asked the manager to speak with me and she would NOT. I asked-- is this was the way they were really going to treat a long time REGULAR customer?  Over a few dollars are they willing to loose me as a customer?  The manager on duty ( I think Yolanda) would not return my call and I will never park at this run down, outdoor only lot with junkie shuttles again. Shame on you I FLY and SAVE. No good faith here.
-DO NOT RELY ON THE ONLINE  RESERVATION SYSTEM
-DO NOT RELY ON THEIR CREDIT CARD SYSTEM WORKING
-DO NOT THINK FOR A MOMENT THEY CARE ABOUT YOU THE CUSTOMER.
Bye forever I Fly and Save-
I have found another lot that puts you to shame - there are many other options for travelers. I choose the your competition of you any day.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Had to have the info desk at the airport confirm that they would pick me up as the receptionist hung up on me. The driver also just left us in the large lot because they don't track any of the cars left in their lot. Seems to be a great place to store a stolen vehicle lol. It was just a horrible experience because every single person we dealt with was rude. One exception was the parking lot attendant who nicely helped us find the car. However, I wouldn't use this service again.<//Review>< UserId.>

Had our car valeted. Came back from our trip and the bumper had major bumper damage. Attendant was clueless. No management was present. Have been trying for a week to get someone's attention. Accidents happen, and I would be fine if they would at least answer my calls, but they don't. I am becoming resigned to the fact that i'll have to pay for it myself. Save yourself the same $$$$ and park elsewhere.< /Text>

NEVER USE THEM If I could give a negative I WOULD! Horrible experience. Pay the extra money and park in a reliable lot. Returned unable to leave bcuz they crowded the lot (greedy). Couldn't find the keys to the car parked blocking me. Waited hours to leave after long day of travel. Contacted them for refund since I prepaid- no response.< /Text>

When I returned, I found a deep crack in the paint and an abrasion from what looks to be a hit and run while I was parked. Since I did not see this until the next morning (my flight landed at night) they told there was nothing that could be done. I asked "if they could receive their camera recordings of the area where I park?" And was met by "they already reviewed it once and no incidence was reported, why should they review it again?" So if this is what you want to deal when leaving your vehicle parked overnight at the airport, you've been warned. I will not be parking here again.<//Review>< userid>

<Time>1365028531388</Time><rating>2< /rating><Review>My worst airport parking experience ever.  I have parked at many different airports across the country and several here in the Bay Area.  I have never had one lie and be so deceitful ever.  I made a reservation online just fine, parked fine, and had good service to and from the airport.  I made a downpayment online with the reservation, with a specific amount due upon my return at the lot listed clearly on my receipt, which I turned in at the window.  The woman at the booth when I was trying to leave said she had nothing to do with the online system and charged me much higher than what was listed on my receipt.  I will never use this parking service again, and I highly recommend that others be careful when offered a discounted price online.  They apparently do not honor it at the booth when leaving, even when I pointed it out on my receipt.  Be careful of the lies and dishonesty of this company.</Review>< pics>

<review>Our outgoing experience was fine. Coming home, however, was horrible. When we left, we were told to call for pick up when we were at Baggage Claim.  We did and we're told to call back when we had out bags.  ok... eight seconds later (seriously) we called back and told them we had our bags. Then, we were told to call back a THIRD time when we got to the pick up sign.  One minute later (no exaggeration) we called again and we're told the van would be on its way. It was cold and down pouring ain. There was NO reason we should have had to call THREE times and then wait in the rainy cold.

We got back to the lot, got in our car and drove away since we had prepaid all fees online ahead of time and the gate/arm was open.  We heard "HEYS" as we drove away. We couldnt stop on the street and we're right on the freeway. I called the lot and told him this info.  He was PISSSED and DEMANDED that we return to the lot right then. I told him I could give him all the info over the phone.  Not good enough for the rude jerk!!  He again demanded that we return right then. When I told him we could not, he hung up on me.

Real professionals at this place!!?

Don't waste your time or money here. There are other businesses that will respect you!!<//review></record>

<Review>I have the same experience as Geoffrey Leigh, and even worse. Looks like you are not the only victim.

I made a reservation on line and paid the parking from May 10 to May 17.
When I chceked out on May17, the cashier said he dont have my reservation information, and asked me to pay to again.

Come on, it is midnight Oakland, I dont think anyone will risk it. So I paid it again, after I paid, he said I can email me reservation to the manager to get the refund.

I scanned both of my reservation and the receipt of May 17 and emailed to them. But never received any email or phone call back. Then I called them, first time the lady said she need to talked to her manager. Several days later I called them for the second time ,I was told the manager just left, and the third time, any other reason, fourth time.....

Looks like I they are doing this kind of trick.</Review>< Pics>

You can order ahead and walk-in to speed things up, but that is if parking is available along Winchester. (Drive-thru line typically blocks out parking lot) Other then that, I'm glad to see more of these open in Bay Area. Love the selection of coffees and food.

<Text>I live like almost 2 hours from this city and it would have been nice if we could order to go inside. We don't go here often so it was hard to visually know if I wanted a flavored donut. The app doesn't show pictures either which would have been helpful. We ended up just getting all glazed. I get it with the whole pandemic, but it was just a slight inconvenience.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Although it was my first time using the DDapp so I had to put in my cc, took more time than I wanted too... the orders were not going through I had to attemp 2x but it work after I tried it again. App needs some work! Hopefully it'll update & it will be better next time. The food & drinks came out perfect and fast. The store is efficient & safe during this pandemic. Thank you!

Wish they had more coffee shops in San Jose.  We need one on the Eastside or Evergreen area!!</Text>< pics>

<review>I love DD & I have been waiting a long time to have one open by me. I've tried going different times a day, busy hours, first thing when they open, etc., and even tho the donuts are great, the service is hit or miss.

I usually order through mobile, which I think should be more spelled out, but my orders are still either wrong or missing some - very unfortunate because I order almost nothing but a box of nothing but a dozen, uncomplicated donuts.

I finally called to complain once when I got home with my "dozen" but only have 9 in the box. I was the second person in line after they opened that morning, & this was again, a mobile order, so I didn't even care to check - how can they mess this one up? I was told that the manager is not in yet, but that they'll give me a callback when they are able, & took my number down. That was last year.

It's just donuts, I know, but- if you're not paid for the last hour, even half hour that you worked, I guess you'll think it's not fair too. One oversight may be okay, but four or five paychecks add up.< /review></record>

Currently drive through and order pickup only. Be prepared to wait for a while if you're gonna use the drive through. Ordering via pickup is way faster. Friendly employees. Peach and passionfruit cooler tasted great, not too sweet so it was pretty good. Apple Cider Donut, a seasonal specialty, is very soft and tastes similar to a puffy apple pie, very good as well.<//Text>

First of all, they only list one donut on their menu. We had to ask for the list of donuts from the staff member. Kudos for Dunkin Donuts expanding their menu, but sadly they skipped on advertising their namesake on their menu (at least their drive-through menu).

Secondly, their donuts were 'ok'. Safeway donuts are better. But with so many local small business in this area, you're better off going to Stan's!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Horrible! I’ve ordered an egg and cheese English muffin and both times I’ve gone, I have gotten them with sausage. If I ever go the third time around hopefully they get it right this time.< /Review>

<review>Went for the first time a few days after their grand opening. I went on a Friday around 1045a and the line of cars was getting pretty long. There are complaints about the line blocking Neal Ave but there's not much one can do when DD is new to this part of SJ. The drive thru girl was super courteous and friendly. She apologized for the wait but I understood since everybody wanted to try DD. I ordered the Power Breakfast sandwich and a iced macchiato. It was a little bland but I added some sugar; my fault for not ordering the caramel macchiato. There was also a line for mobile pick up orders. I'm sure the drive-thru line will get shorter as the hype dies down. I'd def go back again. Tired of the same ol Sbux and Peet's< /review>< pics>

Because it's a drive in you can't see the variety of donuts for sale! You get what they give you! You can change it but you don't know the selections!</Review>

<text>So glad there’s finally one close by! I’ve been to many Dunkins across the country and this one has always consistently has the freshest donuts! Seriously, I’ve always thought Dunkin’ Donuts were trash until I gave them a chance here.
Great location, friendly staff. Drive-thru design is kinda bad though - the line frequently goes out into the street, so parking in the lot is nearly impossible, let alone pulling out of the lot.</text>< Pics>

<text>This Dunkin is great. I love the freshly baked mouth watering 😋 glaze doughnut and sour cream doughnut I got it was amazing Nd to top it off with a strawberry dragonfriut refresher and a maple bacon sandwich 🥪 😋 👌.
I can't  wait  to start the next season firey products 😍  keep up the good work dunkin I'll surely be back.
I Don't mind the long wait it because I understand that they are a new store and rather than complaining I appreciate the fact that they are open but more importantly everyone there is so curtious and very inviting. Great customer service 👏 👌 👍.</text>< Response>

Poorly planned location created a traffic hazard. Due to a line into drive-through, bus stop is inaccessible, cars getting into the line have to u-turn on a street with no sidewalks, adjacent driveways onto Neal are blocked, delivery routes are disrupted, drivers trying to get onto Winchester are forced to use wrong lane and risk head-on collision with cars turning onto Neal Ave.</review>

So if you ask for a "chocolate glazed", what do you expect to get?  Maybe I'm wrong but I didn't expect to get a chocolate cake donut :(</Text>

(Translated by Google) Everything is very tasty. The only bad thing is that they do not have service inside just ordering by car or ordering before online and this Dunkin does not appear online to order.

(Original)
Esta muy rico todo. Lo único malo es que no tienen servicio adentro solo pidiendo en coche o ordenando antes por Internet y este Dunkin no aparece en línea para ordenar.<//text>

<username>Gracia< /username><text>(Translated by Google) It is strategically located, but I do not give 5 stars because you cannot ask inside, walking, without having gone through the app first, so it is better to close the door and only accept for cars

< Review>
I like that there's a Bloomingdale's at this outlet as I've been to a few in Southern California. However, I rarely find anything here to my liking unlike the ones down south. The surrounding outlet stores are really nice though, which I frequently purchase from.<//Review>

<Review>It's great to have a bloomies outlet, but the store is always a mess. They are obviously understaffed, and overrun. In current conditions, there is very little done in regard to Covid-9 and distancing control outside of a bottle of sanitizer at the door. They should really work on the floor organization and cleanliness. Like i said, its always a mess< /Review><Name>Loren Craig Harrington</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Some great prices on name brand clothes including Miss. Me jeans, cosmetics, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger. Great selection of heavy coats, and home goods.  I was surprised there weren't more shoes to speak but the ones they do have are on point.  They are located in the San Francisco Outlets.  If you have some extra money it's a great place to go.  Something for everyone.< /Review>< user_id>

<review>Superb selection of designer shoes!!!! Prices & styles we're fashion forward and trending. Customer service was very "Nordstrom" like....attentive, knowlegable and friendly. I was focused on purchasing one it....I walk out with four. Store was well stocked, clean and inviting. I will definately, be making this store a destination stop for all of my special occasion needs.< /review>< name>

Good selection of mid-range fashion at reasonable prices, unfortunately I couldn't buy anything because I left after waiting to check out for 30 minutes because they only had one slow cashier working and a long line of customers.< /Text>

They used to have a great men's selection, but it's shrinking.  The selection is now too small and I won't go back.</Review>

Picked up a chicken biryani, medium spicy with a side order of raitha and a side of mixed pickle achar.  The quantity is excellent and was a solid meal for two. The biryani was very good and appropriately seasoned.  Next time I will order it extra spicy.  Also got the masala chai. It was delicious and piping hot!</review>

Good food and service. The lime water is very refreshing, a nice contrast to the common lemon. I appreciate that they ask how spicy you want your food. I had the stewed eggplant, the chicken tikka and the tandoori chicken. It's a generous portion of food, with options from a variety of regions in India.< /review>

I've never really gotten into Indian food, but I am definitely a fan now. I just never knew what to order. I'll tell you, the lamb korma is out of sight!!! Get it with rice and naan.< /Review>

I’ve eaten there before and the food was delicious but I just ordered and I couldn’t even recognize the food. Disgusting taste and undercooked chicken. The Tikka Masala was horrid. I tried to force myself to eat it so my husband wouldn’t feel bad about the money we spent ($60 fro two Tikkas and  one shrimp) but I couldn’t and he hated it too. We are familiar with the Nepalese’s Indian food and love it but this wasn’t it. Couldn’t eat it threw it away and order again the same plates from a better restaurant. Not consistent. If you buy from here it’ll be a gamble. Maybe they will have a good day and it’ll be good or they will be off and you’ll be served horrid “food”. If I could give it less than one star I would.< /Review>

Great cuisine right off the square in Sonoma. We don't get good Indian food often, so this was a real treat!</Review>

<text>I’m always up for great tasting Indian food. But if you’re an Indian restaurant and you can’t even make the most popular dish outstanding, that’s all on you. First time to order from this restaurant and the flavor was so underwhelming! The sauces tasted watered down. I can definitely taste the makings of a good sauce, but they made it too thin and that sort of watered down the flavors. It probably needed to reduce more. Disappointing, really. The chicken was tender though, as well as the lamb. But when we talk about Indian food, it’s all about the sauce and its flavor, of which, the two dishes I ordered were lacking. I ordered Lamb Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala with Coconut Rice. The rice was also under cooked! All of these definitely did not justify the pretty hefty price tag. Oh well. *Sigh* NEXT!!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>Expensive Mediocre Americanized Indian Food.  2.5 stars for the service, 3 stars for the food.   The server did his job, but he scowled the whole time -- I suspect he was homophobic, but maybe he just was having a bad day.  The food was ok, but way too expensive for what you got (I think that "cooking" involved a can opener and a microwave).  Everything is ordered "al la carte",  and they would not give me a half order of any appetizer; so this is not a good place to eat if you are solo.   Serving sizes are huge, so it is more economical to go there with at least two people and share.  I am as strict vegetarian, and this is the food I ordered for which I based this review: palak paneer, plain naan, jasmine white rice, masala chai, and kheer.</Review>< Pics>

But we were highly highly disappointed. Not only the food but the hospitality of the staff was unwelcoming. Ordered a biryani, it was a meshed rice pudding. The kale pakodas were icy cold from inside, it was apperent that they don't cook fresh there rather recoil frozen food.
Its obvious that most of the positive feedbacks are fake or been bought inside the restaurant for discount.< /review><user_id>117524073655344425664< /user_id>< rating>

Ordered something off the menu they claimed was a specialty and it was the most bland Indian food I've ever had. I asked for it to be very spicy and there was no kick at all. Service was ok but not great. Will not be going back.</review>

Delicious Indian cuisine, with each dish layered with exotic flavors, simmered down to create wonderful sauces, rich, intense and soul satisfying bites. Each appetizer, soup, salad, entree, and dessert are uniquely seasoned, with the option to make the dish has hot or mild as your taste buds allow. Wonderful flavors and textures that are well executed from the kitchen.<//review>

Great food! The service is very eager and may leave you feeling rushed. Take your time and stick to 1 entree + 1 carb per person and you won't go wrong.</text>

Service was good, food was ok. Chicken was done good but the naan was tasteless. The other main dishes were also done good, so overall it's a good Indian restaurant if you are looking for in the area.< /text>

Food is excellent. I ordered today online and was charged some random amount for ordering through their website, and when I asked about it they offered no explanation. It won't stop me from going there because the food is great but I won't order online again. Nowhere on their website does it say you will be charged for ordering online.<//Text>

<review>The food was authentic and quite good, with some excellent house specialties, and good prep on standard dishes.  The smoked eggplant is a knockout.  A tandoori saag was unexpected and well conceived.  Colorful Indian parasols hang from the ceiling, making the otherwise ordinary decor feel a bit festive.  The service is professional and the prices are fair.  We went at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon and had the restaurant to ourselves.   It's one of the best Indian restaurants in the county. They also have vegan dishes, clearly marked.  Their chai tea was not hot enough.  Otherwise...Yum!<//review></record>

<review>Eat healthy, think better. That's all I can say. Delhi Belly serves low fat, but delicious food. If your tired of eating greasy Indian food and want to try something similar to organic. This is the right place for you and don't forget to try the lime ginger chicken, rest thanks me later.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x8085aea805c3b807:0x3e898d166991acdd<//GmapID><time>1451518963384< /time><response>None< /response><UserId.>101919405456934686007<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

First time having Indian food and enjoyed it. We picked the two recommendations from out server, the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Rohan Josh (Lamb). We also got the coconut rice and lemon rice on the side. Both dishes were very tender and came out fast. I'll order it again next time.

Kumar our server, was great. Very fast and friendly, and had extensive knowledge of the menu.<//Text>

Reasonably good Indian food. Kashmiri naan was a surprise, quite excellent. Good curries. Chai was very spicy.

Would give it five stars but the waiter was kind of pushy trying to get us to order more and it put us off a bit. Other than that it was good Indian food and I'd go again.</Review>

Amazing flavors in every dish we ordered: Garlic basil naan with dipping sauces, Dal Bukhara and Vegetable Coconut Curry. All delish!! Service was quick and attentive. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be returning when in the Sonoma area again!!</Text>

Longer review fell into the deepest depths of the interwebs. Cuisine remind me a lot of my favorite place from my college years in Davis-- so disappointed when they changed ownership. My go-tos of bhaigan bharta and chicken tika marsala were delicious, my husband inhaled my leftovers when I got home. Mango lassi was a mango lassi, hard to get it wrong-- yum.

Four stars because our entrees came out thirty minutes after the soup and salad ordered by those in our party who wanted lighter fare. They were likely bringing out the appetizer-type orders first, common enough mistake, but we'd made it clear we weren't really sharing. They also forgot a member of our party's coffee, and she thought it tasted/smelled horrible when it came; the water in our glasses was the same and it tasted fine... and I'm picky as hell about that. They did give us separate checks, though this probably added to the confusion, but still-- it shouldn't be too hard to handle a four-top at noon with the restaurant at only half-capacity.

The waiters and bussers were hotttt. *cough*

I'll up it to five if the service is better next time.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) A very nice space and good service, but Taste Of The Himalayas is richer and cheaper.

Every time I go there or call they are short with me on the phone. Lack customer service. We eventually did purchase compost from them (big mistake). The compost was completely dead. It was bone dry, no aroma etc. I recommend checking or testing it prior to purchasing. Other people who have used them told me they had the same issues with the compost. Unaware of other product quality they offer. I am guessing the compost we got from them was overheated.</Text>

<Text>Check the hours before you go. Call before you go to make sure they have what you need in stock. I get the free mulch, which does have yeah in it and scrolls bad but it's really good at matting down to hold hillsides in place.</Text>< user>

Its a lot less expensive than the landfill a little ways up the road. The staff here has always been friendly and respectful in either situation.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Their compost is a great way to jump start your garden. Kinda stinky when delivered... Just water it well several times and the stinky will go away. Your plants will go crazy.</Review>< gmap_id>

In are darkest days the Social hog was there for us. This weekend was the best n the history of our business because of the hard work that this company put in for my business. We had our official Re-Grand Opening and it was fantastic. We literally had lines all day to get into our doors.
I am a man of god and I had prayed hard, and my prayers were answered by the social hog coming my way. God Bless.< /review>

<text>The Social Hog is honestly the best company I have had the pleasure of dealing with since I have been actively on social media. They have not only created all of our social media for us, they have walked us trough the ins and outs of posting, and have taught us a lot. I want to thank Brenda for all of her hard work on my account. Muchas Gracias Meja.<//text></record>

<Review>I have to say, during this pandemic (COVID-19)all of my locations have seen a decrease in overall sales because we were forced to close for a short period of time, but the social hog has been here every step of the way. I can honestly say that because of them I have now been able come back from one of the worse times in my career. My shops are all back up and running and I am back to serving the best beefs in Chicago. These guys have been updating all of my customers in our status and helped us bring them all back along with a bunch of new ones.
As a business owner I can recommend these guys, and I will also tell you that I have seen the negative reviews being done by “scam artists” on their page. I know real customers don’t leave an reviews like that, and further more I would like ask any of them to message me and tell me how it is a management company can “scam” you? You own your pages, all these guys do is manage them. Shame on you for trying to hurt these guys.
You want a real recommendation, come to me. I have the best beefs in Chicago, and the best company representing me.</Review>< user_name>

Wowzers is all I can say. These wonderful souls helped me bring customers in my door. Their service speaks for itself. Covid19 almost put us out of business, but because of these beautiful souls(especially Brenda), I was able to bring customers in, and we are all happy once again. I am sending you all a bunch of gift certificates.  -Johnny< /text>

Clmaied ownership of my business through Google without me contacting them. I suspect they do that to trick small businesses into hiring them..

Edit: so they're basically replying to anyone with negative feedback saying "you're confused"
NO WE AREN'T CONFUSED YOU'RE A SCAM

Edit 2: THEY JUST CALLED OUR RESTAURANT THREATENING TO LEAVE A 100 1-STAR REVIEW IF I DON'T REMOVE THIS REVIEW. I HAVE THEIR EMAIL REQUESTING TO CLAIM OWNERSHIP TO OUR BUSINESS AND I HAVE A VIDEO RECORDER WITH THIER CALLER ID ON THE PHONE

BE AWARE OF THIS COMPANY. I ALREADY CONTACTED MY LAWYERS AND IF YOU HAVE ONE YOU SHOULD TOO.<//Text>

I highly recommend this company. During Covid19 this company has been key, in keeping us alive. It is actually funny, I am reading the reviews for them, and the only negative reviews come from people who have not used their service, and people who have not been hired to work for them lol. Whatever you are doing over there, keep doing it.</text>

God Bless The Social Hog. In a time of uncertainty this company really helped bring the customers in my door. I have a premier salon here in Beverly Hills, and Covid19 obviously had a huge impact on my business. After being closed for a couple months, this company helped bring the customers back in my door. They did everything from re-launch my business online, to post on all social media that I was back. I have been receiving calls from not only clientsI haven't seen for years, but so many new prospective clients as well. I ask all of my clients where they found me, and they all say online. If you are looking for an honest group of people to work with, this is the company for you.< /review>

I had the best experience working with Ely and his team at Social Media Hog. Their people are so knowledgeable and experienced. The account managers really cared about my needs and made sure all of my concerns were addressed up front. I highly recommend Social Hog to anyone who needs social media services.< /text>

They blew my socks off. I did not expect much to be honest, but they really have helped me bring customers in my door. I own a small Italian Restaurant and since I have been using them, I have seen a humongous increase in customers.</Review>

<review>They called our business and pretended to be google...then told us that you need to have "special" code for google keywords which is complete bs. When we told them we have someone in house that can do it, they switched up their pitch and said you have to be google certified in order to inject the code. Honesty is the best policy in this day and age in tech. Just tell businesses that you are trying to sell them your services. Don't beat around the bush and waste peoples time. If your service is good they can research it themselves and make an educated decision. Tricking people into services is deceitful and won't build you long lasting relationships with your clients. Implement better business practices.< /review></record>

<Review>I never leave reviews on Google, but felt compelled to after being with these guys for a year. They have gone out of there way to help us out here at my studio. We started with these guys as a small studio, in the last year we have doubled our staff because of the amount of growth we have had online. These guys helped us trend online so much that we doubled our numbers in one quarter. Our site looks amazing and so is our social media presence.

Hiring them was the best move I have made to make my business rank on top of Google. They are professional and very upfront about their pricing but deliver good results. I would recommend them if you are looking for an agency that will help you putting your company's online pressense.<//review>

Be aware !!!! Once you fire them for not providing the service (they insisted and forced upon you.)They will destroy your online presence by creating multiple other DUPLICATE  locations , and not providing primary ownership to the client of who had signed up. Everyone knows that doing that can really effect your business online. Think 4 times before even going through them for some what of any help. Glad I chose a new company to manage my business presence for no monthly charge . Some people I can actually rely on. Hopefully they dont do the same to you !!<//Text>

These guys have impressed me from the beginnin. When I signed up i didn't even have a Facebook. My restaurant is now on every form of social media and we are trending not only online but in Sherman Oaks as well. We have have had our busiest year since working with these guys. I am so thankful for the work that has been done. And thank you Wendy for making this all work for me.</Text>

They called pawning themselves off as google to try to sell there service that you can do yourself. The other negative review on these guys is probably the only real review they have. Beware these scammers.<//Review>

<Text>Nice Mexican Restaurant with good selection of dishes.  Ample seating both indoors and outdoors.  Fire pits and also a large fireplace outdoors are a nice addition to keep warm while outside in the evening. Grilled Salmon dish with fruit salad and sauce was very good.  Good service and atmosphere.

The ambiance was fantastic. The service was top-notch. However, make sure you make a reservation if it's on the weekend. The only thing that calls me to mark them down was the food. There was nothing special about the entree itself. It wasn't robust, it wasn't over the top delicious, it was just satisfactory. The bartenders on the other hand were fantastic. They were attentive and made sure that the drinks were above par.< /text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>This restaurant is at a great location in Santa Barbara. Close to downtown but just enough distance from the craziness of all State Street. The service was okay (keep in mind I was there late on Friday afternoon) I wasn’t impressed but I was comfortable enough to eat there. I did not have a bad experience if that’s why you think I only gave it three stars, I just felt that their version of their Mexican food was a bit bland. We had the guacamole, carnitas plate and chicken Caesar salad. Food presentation was great I just wished it would have had more flavor to it.</text>< name>

We ordered some guacamole, fajitas, quesadillas. Everything could be shared and tasted great. Great service as well.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Francesco V did an excellent job as our waiter.

Fast to be seated. Child friendly. Coloring pad and crayons provided.
Chips and salsa as soon as seated.
Three rooms. Capacity for big parties. Somewhat dated interior but clean nonetheless.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Was with friends, coming back from Lompoc. Absolutely delicious margaritas and cocktails. The salsa does have a mild heat (I love hot) but very flavorful. The staff were polite and welcoming. I highly recommend.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I like to start by judging Mexican food by their chips and drinks and this place did not disappoint me. The chips were one of the best I've had. It's the type that melts in your mouth. The margarita flight looked good but didn't have much alcohol in it. I also ordered the nachos and oysters. The oyster was surprisingly good and would definitely order again. The nacho was decent, nothing special.<//Review>

<review>The food was very good here. The salsa and chips are perfect together. The location is on the corner and close to adequate parking. Free parking is available for at least an hour. One can also purchase beer here. The seafood ceviche and garlic shrimp we're enjoyable. I would definitely come here again.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Although we just hung out at the bar, their margaritas were quite enjoyable. The bartenders were busy that day, so ordering a drink took awhile. Would likely come back here again to grab a few drinks next time we visit.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Bar seating and restaurant seating. When they asked our group where we preferred to sit, I wish they had used that differentiation instead of "tall chairs or short chairs." The bar has TVs on all 4 walls. Automatic surcharge for a group of 6 or more.  The black beans have more flavor than the pinto beans. The red sauce on the enchiladas was lacking. They are pretty accommodating if you want to change something about your dish when ordering. Furniture is a bit worn. Chips were warm and fresh. The salsa was perfect.</review><Name>Lisa Ponsor<//Name>< gmapID>

Had a nice brunch on the patio - I had Chile Verde which was spicy but good (also not green!) and my husband had the carne asada. We really liked both dishes and the house made tortillas were great. Generous portions.</Text>

The GM is the five star. The food was great. Ambiance... perfect. My original service from my server was awful. Unfortunately,  I had to make a complaint. Once I made the complaint a manager came over and he was amazing! He even came and sat and talked with me. He was amazing. He made it right. Margaritas and food are fabulous! I can’t wait to come back! I love that the general manager made a point to come over and make me a happy customer.<//Text>

Food poisoning for my wife and I thanks to them. All the other food poisoning reviews on here (which I found afterwards) are no coincidence. After addressing my concern with them the next day, they didn’t do anything, despite how obvious it was. I threw up my entire meal before we left and my wife got really sick 3 hours later. Both my wife and my food contained steak. After returning 4 times and requesting a refund, they kept saying they would have someone call me, but never did, despite talking to the manager and threatening to file a report with the BBB. I wrote the attached note for them. This happened on 4/3. I’ve waited long enough and it’s clear that they don’t take giving their customers food poisoning very seriously. I’ll be filing the report with the BBB now.< /text>

The only decent thing about this place are the margaritas.  Food is uninspiring blah, and not worth the price.  Service is hit and miss.  I’ve gotten up and left after waiting for waitstaff that never came in 45 minutes.  Lots of better Mexican food restaurants in the area.</review>

Beautiful location, great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. Enjoyed our evening dinner, but the food was not authentic Mexican food. It wasn't bad, but it tasted very American. Overall it's a very nice  restaurant but I was expecting better tasting food from such a great place.< /text>

<time>1536157948038< /time><rate>2<//rate><review>My burrito was very good.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  My wife's fajitas had a bizarre tomato juice like taste though.

But what makes my review low was not the food or the ambiance.  We had the worst, most apathetic  waitress I have ever encountered in my life.  She did absolutely nothing but take our order, and I mean that completely.  There is no exaggeration in that statement.  She came by a few times to ask us if we needed anything, but when we made a request, she would just smile and blow us off.  We asked for refills on our water twice, and twice I was forced to go to the bar and get the refills myself.  We asked for more chips and salsa 3 times, and three times I had to flag down the bus boy to do her job. What the Hell? Were we not worth her time, because we ordered no alcohol?< /review>< pics>

<Text>Ok where do we start. Restaurant isn't busy at all. We were sat down and waited 15 minutes with no server before we had to ask the host for a server. We place our order after waiting a while longer. My beer arrives and its completely flat, so we send it back for another, which is also flat but drinkable. Food arrives and every plate had some kind of issue with it; one dish is sent back for a replacement, the other two were edible but not great. After we've eaten we ask for the cheque, then have to ask several more times before we get it.

Crappy service.
Crappy food.

<text>The expriance of this was a good one. The location was nice and there's plenty to see and do here. It's surrounded by the Pier by the beach was nice. I have a great time there I went with my girlfriend and we stayed at a hotel nearby too. I had fun celebrating there. We also went wine tasting after. I recommend this location but do be sure to stop by to check it out for yourself. Enjoy.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The good: the wait staff were friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. They gave my sister a free drink for her birthday.

The ok: the food. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. The tortillas are pretty good.

The bad: the house margarita. Bar none the worst margarita I've ever had. I talked with the waitress about it and she recommended the "skinny" margarita, so we ordered that. That one was decent. I was a little peeved that we were charged full price for the pitcher of the house margarita because it was awful. And we didn't drink half of it.< /text>

We wanted a place to take our dear friends from Michigan, who absolutely LOVE Santa Barbara, and somewhere newish for them. First place we thought of was Casa Blanca. We enjoy the location (a nice walk after, to the pier), the upbeat atmosphere in the bar area, and ordering off the appetizer menu (did someone say "Nachos"?) was just the perfect outing on a summer's eve. The waiter was super cool, and we loved that we could even wear shorts.</review>

Couple mistakes on the order, not by our server but by the kitchen staff which were behind us and we could hear them carry on. they were using bad language and what they did the day before including smoking pot and drinking Victoria beer. I could see why they can't get an order correct. My fiance was there and she is a very nice lady and she was made uncomfortable with the language. This is the second we have been there and similar situations have happened. I don't we will try for a third.  We made our server aware since there was no manager available. Very poor service.<//review>

Good service, and fast. Instantly seated a party of 2 on a Friday night. Quick chip & water service. Salsa was a bit watery & ran out quickly, but was tasty and refilled just as fast. The service overall was good (namely by the bus service) but the waitress seemed a little absent minded. But, no complaints. Food was VERY tasty, and reasonably priced. Drinks were a little pricey, but I felt they ver quite strong. Desert (flan) was lacking and seemed like it was not freshly made, and I wouldn't order it again. Overall the experience was positive and would return.< /Text>

Loved the interior but that was about it. My food came out late compared to the rest of my group and it was cold. Not only were my eggs and potatoes cold they also didn't have much flavor< /Text>

I have been here several times in the last year quality of food is bad. I tried the chicken and beef. Last time I went there I only took one bite of the burrito that was $16. Horrible taste. This place has gone down hills. The waiter did not even ask why it was not eaten. Just asked if I was done so she get another customer. Sharkey burrito lots better<//Text>

<review>Very good service and certain dishes are excellent.         I am updating my review. Since my last review the service has gotten considerably worse, not that it's the server's fault. The restaurant is now very poorly managed and under staffed. The food is still good but the drinks are no longer very well made especially there premium call tequila's. Its  a real shame it was one of the best rn town. Now it's gone from a 10 to two. Very sad.</review><Rating>2</Rating>< user_name>

Food was soooooo good. Service was a little off but we were there with a large party for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding so it was a little bit chaotic. Overall the staff was friendly and the food was good but a lot of orders were missed and some people had to wait forever to get their food.<//review>

Sorry, this was not a good experience....the chef and the server did not take care of this place properly.    Hostess was friendly, she was courteous and prompt(4 stars)....server was not very attentive and took long intervals to check on us....ran out of chips water and eventually patience....had to ask hostess for service.   The chef/line cook served a carnitas plate  where the portions seemed plentiful however I cannot overlook the pork jerky.  More than 50% of the meat was dried enough you could not stick a fork into it because it was crumbling.   This was a HUGE oversight from the kitchen.   Again had to get hostess to find server...they did replace meal it was prepared properly and tasted good.    Again the flavor was not the issue......I might try later.</review>

< Review>
The food at this place was awful!  The chips tasted burnt.  The black beans were flavorless.  The tortillas were soggy - yes, SOGGY!  The only redeeming aspect of this place was the service, which was great.  Don't let the packed crowds fool you.  This has to be one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've ever eaten at.<//Review>

<Review>The interior decor of Casa Blanca is absolutely amazing!  The food was definitely tasty and the margaritas were strong.  We had a nice waitress that was very responsive to our larger group and the chips & salsa stayed re-filled at all times.  Will definitely be back again!< /Review>< rating>

Very easy to walk by since the beach is right there... but honestly by missing it you would be doing your tastebuds a disservice.  The food here is nothing short of amazing and the tequila selection matches.  A great place to chill or grab dinner.  Do NOT pass it by.  I recommend anything with Shrimp.  Everything else is great but the shrimp is cooked to perfection everytime.</Review>

Food and atmosphere was great but we did end up waiting awhile for our food. It could have been because it was New Year's Eve. I would love to check it out again when it's not so crazy....and update my review.<//Review>

Food here sucks. When they brought our food it was cold. Nevertheless the micheladas are nasty. It taste like seltzer water with tomatoe juice. I would not recommend this place< /Review>

Service was not the best. Drinks were never refilled, never got the water I asked for. Ordered the ceviche platter it was bland no flavor. Asked for lemon got the smallest sliver! My son's food was cold. Dinner menu is small not many options to choose from.</text>

Happy hour specials are pretty good. We like the guacamole and chips and taco Tuesdays. It is one of our Football Monday and Thursday spots. Service is always good with friendly staff and bartenders.</review>

I've been here twice and both times were good. Parking is a challenge. I had one of their specials which was a soup/stew which was great. I've also had a regular plate of enchiladas which was ok. Bar is great and decor is very good. Dining room is huge. A fun place to eat with good food and decent prices.</text>

<Review>The staff were all friendly and very efficient. However, in my opinion, the menu for our tour group did not describe the dishes well enough.  The "Enchiladas de las casa" which I selected were much spicier than I expected, based on the description we had been given.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80e913885c45258f:0x9563fc24001a1b4e< /GmapID></record>

Nice place, good drinks but you won't get excited by the food. So many better, like much better options, in the area. Carnitas was soo dry... Ceviche was good (shrimp) and bad (whitefish). Oh, just had the flan. Wow! Awesome,< /Text>

We went there midafternoon for drink and appetizers,  no waiter or waitress came to our table to take our order.....I had to tell the hostess can we at least get a glass of water....15 min later a waiter stopped by our table and said he is very busy and will come back after put the order in......Since we had an appointment we got water and margaritas from the bar! Horrible service and stale chips and below average margaritas!!!!!! If I could give zero star I would....... Terrible service and below average drinks, and rude, unfriendly staff!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

If 3 is average...then spot on.   Serviceable Mexican food for watching sports. Don't expect authentic.  Don't expect to be taken care of.   Expect a loud raucus time...great for sports ...thats it.< /Text>

I went with a Living Social coupon, with the only stipulation on the coupon being that you had to order two full priced meals. My boyfriend and I went during Happy Hour, ordered two meals off the full priced menu, but were also ordering Happy Hour drinks. We gave our waitress the coupon when we ordered, and had a great meal. The problem was that our waitress didn't tell us that since we were using the coupon, we weren't allowed to order drinks at the Happy Hour prices, even though there was no distinction on the coupon. We ended up paying a lot more than we were planning on due to the misunderstanding. If we had been told that at the beginning of the meal, we would have adjusted our meal/drink orders accordingly, but I ended up just feeling scammed by the restaurant. So even though the food and drinks were good, I won't be going back because I felt swindled.<//text>

Had the soft tacos one chicken one asada. The chicken taco was good but the asada was fantastic. Sat outside under the pepper trees, can't beat that ambience. Very good attentive service. We got there at 5pm on a Thursday do the crowd was small< /Review>

It's okay.  The margarita I had tasted like the mix was that cheap kind you get in the grocery store.  The queso fundido was delicious.  I probably will not go back.  Althought the decor is really beautiful.  Nice tile work.<//text>

<review>Horrible, horrible service.  Should of left once it took the hostess 10 mins to sit us down.  We were the only ones waiting.  Once we finally sat down another 5-10 mins to get chips and salsa and drinks.  Placed order for food, needed a refills and chips and nobody of service.  Finally told waiter to cancel order and walked out.<//review>< Pics>

I ordered wet burrito and it was bad no flavor and it upset my stomach. I only enjoyed chips and salsa. Won't be returning.</text>

They have okay food but for whatever reason they don't have good mixed drinks.  I've been there 4-5 times and the drinks have been really bad EVERY time!!    It's not like the Casa Blanca that use to be up the street back a few years ago.< /review>

< review>
I seen a video that was posted on my Facebook involving a 500 dollar burrito challenge. In the video a guy was eating the burrito and eat it within 10 mins. So i went down to santa barbara with my 15 year old son and we both took on the challenge the staff didnt read me a disclaimer nor did they inform me of the contents of the burrito. So while i was eating it i noticed the burrito wasn't wrapped like in the video and i kept seeing a vegetable all over the burrito. I asked my son if his burrito was really spicy and he replied yes. I asked the staff what was in it they replied habanero. It became so hot that my son began to throw up. I even got sick because the amount of chili they put in it was beyond even normal. Who goes to a regular restaurant and gets a super spicy burrito as a normal standard order. asked them to stop the contest and they did but they still charged me 45.00 dollars for each burrito.THERE food wasn't worth the drive the food might be ok if your were already drunk and there contest is a shame the guy in the video doing the challenge is one of there own employees. The management wont even reimburse me for there getting my son and i sick.smh.</review>
