They are great at getting you in and out, and do a great job on my haircuts without a lot of extras added in.  Reasonable prices.  Big tvs so you can watch TV while you are getting your haircut.  They are OK with women even though it says haircuts for men.  I have short hair so it still works.<//review>

<text>I had to wait almost an hour for a trim, but appreciated Great Clips being open until 8pm. The stylist was pleasant. I had a trim of shoulder-length hair that took the stylist less than 10 minutes to finish. The price was $25.00, plus a $5.00 tip (lowest suggested amount at checkout). This amount did NOT include a shampoo or blow dry, so I had to leave with wet hair (the stylist sprayed my hair with water before the trim). The price was a bit high for the service I received, but I was able to get a trim during COVID-19, so I was grateful for that.<//text>< gmap_id>

I’ve been going here for a while now, and I’ve notice that they have a new manager every visit and they just keep getting worse down the road. Even my wife noticed that it’s  just the lack of personality that makes me not want to come back and just the other day I got a FAST hair cut by a so called, Toby she was nice but when I really looked at my hair it was very choppy and not blended right overall it’s a good store just could do some improvements with management and costumer service most of the lady’s their are great workers. I wish the best of luck to the current manager and to the next.</review>

Fantastic haircut from Jacky. Really nice fade. She was fun to talk with and very sociable while doing a nice haircut.
Edit. Nov 29. Got another great haircut, this time from Yobi. Fantastic fade. And she makes for great conversations. Overall fantastic job once again.<//review>

<review>The staff are very friendly! They provided safe and efficient customer service. The haircut was amazing! They do not "style" women's hair but they do an AMAZING job with trimming/cutting! I would highly recommend this spot for anyone who likes a quick cut! I am a "low maintenance " kind of chick, so this is a great spot to cut-and-go!< /review>< Pics>

<review>Honestly the best haircut and treatment you can get for the price. I used to go to super expensive places until I did the MVP here. Now I'm never going anywhere else. Not always the best cut but find a person you like get their card and stick with them. Plus checking in online is really convenient and fast. Not to mention military discount.</review></record>

Rosie was awesome and she did a great job! My biggest complaint Is that I bought a season pass in Kearny Mesa and they don’t honor it at the Mission Valley sports clips. No one at the Kearny mesa store mentioned that you have to redeem it only at their sister stores that are owned by the same owner. These are franchises so be careful.< /Review>

There has only been one exception when I received a bad haircut in Yuma Sports Clips. The haircut was so bad that I had to go to Mission Valley Sports Clips just 2 days later.  The young lady at Mission Valley fixed the bad cut . I wish I could remember her name because she deserves high praise.  She is a young Black lady whose station is first on the right.  Highly skilled barber and very professional.  As far as the Yuma store, it was a new girl and she tried her best  but I think she needs more training before allowing her to cut customers hair. She seemed very nervous also.  I will go back to Yuma because I normally get good haircuts there.<//text>< pics>

My two year old has had all of his haircuts done at Sport Clips. We just moved to the area and I brought him to this location for the first time. I described to the stylist (I think her name was Anna) exactly what we usually get but he walked away with a bowl cut. Not only did she not do a good job with the cut but she was also rude. The other stylists were very kind though. Will definitely not be going back.< /Review>

Mel cut my 3 yr old’s hair and did a phenomenal job. She kept him entertained and kept moving around adjusting to his wiggling.
Best haircut he’s ever had. We’ll be back many many times.

I had Dalia for my appointment and she was WONDERFUL. She explained every step of the appointment clearly and was able to answer all of my questions on top of giving me the exact haircut I was looking for. The service is, as you might have guessed, made with men in mind-- HOWEVER the staff were wonderful and adjusted some service options so that I wasnt feeling out of place. They gave me excellent service, relaxed atmosphere, and a damn fine haircut. What more can you ask for?<//text>

The actual haircut was good.  My problem with the visit was that I checked in online for a 2:55 appointment.  I wasn’t helped until after 4pm because the assigned hair stylist took a break after helping the guest before me.  There was no process to reassign a online appointment to another stylist, instead I spent over an hour waiting for a pre-set time slot that I showed up for.  Pointless and frustrating.  Again the haircut and stylist was good, the problem I have is with the lack of a system.</Text>

We love Sports Clips Mission Valley. Yesterday Mel & Brittany serviced our boys. Mel was so gentle with our 1 year old. We were concerned with him breaking out or someone being too rough, but she was very patient. She played with him to make him comfy & understood that kids at that age move a lot. Brittany was patient & kind as well even with our oldest falling asleep in the chair lol. Our oldest loves that Sports Clips washes his hair. Both ladies took very good care of our boys. We will continue to use this location. :)</review>

<text>It was my first time at Sports Clips and I came away incredibly impressed. I was greeted warmly when I walked in and was seated with Jacki promptly. I was given a double discount on the MVP as a first time customer and I loved it. I’ll definitely be back</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Good haircuts at very reasonable prices. The hot towel and scalp massage is incredibly relaxing. My only complaint is that there's fairly high turnover of stylists so when I find one that I really like they're often gone within a year or less. Very relaxed and casual place and every stylist I've had has been friendly and helpful.<//Review>

Nikki was great! I did not really know what I wanted, I just new my hair was wildly out of control. I told her to be creative. She blew my mind with a haircut I love. Of course the perks of the MVP are always a plus. I’m no haircut review fashionista, but I know this; I left there feeling refreshed, energized, and full of confidence. I love the haircut and look forward to my next visit!< /Text>

No problems with the staff. People come in waves at random times of the day so you'll just have to get lucky with wait times, which can range anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. I've rarely ever had to wait more than 15 though. However I only go on the weekends so I can't speak for the weekdays. Also, they often have problems with their registers and it holds people up from checking in. Sometimes they only take cash because the registers go on the fritz, too. Despite all that I've never been discouraged to go here because they do a pretty good job!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

They have also always kept detailed notes on how my hair was cut and by what stylists so they can get it as close to my last cut as possible or make changes if I request.
Its also I nice to get to watch sports as you get your hair cut. I will definitely continue to get my hair cut here</Text><user_id>101565003356775961700<//user_id><user_name>Rich B<//user_name>< resp>

When I was in the Navy, I used to get a haircut at a weekly basis. Now that I have retired, I would get a haircut maybe once a month to once every two months. I used to go to SuperCuts but their stylists never really pay attention to what I request them to do. I usually tell the stylists at SuperCuts to trim the sides only but they’d end up cutting some off the top. Brittany at SportsClips did a great job trimming only what I told her to and she did a great job with the MVP treatment.<//Text>

<text>This was our first time using Sports Clips. We haven’t been in SD long & our son needed a haircut. We were greeted as soon as we entered & did not have a long wait time. Jamie cut our son’s hair. She was awesome. She made sure he was comfy & made sure she gave him the haircut that he asked for. Since he was a new client, she washed his hair, a steamed towel, & gave him a massage. He loved it. The other girls offered some toys for our 9 month old to play with while we waited. Great experience. We will definitely be back :)</text>< name>

<text>I almost never write reviews (unless to warn people) but I was recently looking for a new hair stylist and decided to try out the Sports Clips in Mission Valley and this is the BEST place in SD for men to go.

The entire staff is friendly and helpful, they show sports and have TVs for the waiting area and for each individual station.  I got the MVP and I highly recommend it.  They give you a shampoo and a relaxing scalp massage.

The best part of the entire experience was that I gave my stylist a few directions and she made my hair look better than it has ever looked.  There's nothing more important about a haircut than walking out of the shop looking great and I couldn't believe what a great job Polly did even though she has never cut my hair before.

This is a MUST for all guys!< /text>< Pics>

I came in with no real idea of what I wanted but Hannah knew exactly what to do with the vague idea I gave her. She did a fantastic job of cutting and styling my hair with its natural flow and she trimmed and shaped my beard way better than I ever could. 10/10, especially with the MVP experience, you feel like a new man afterward!<//text>

Had a really great experience here, they faded my hair perfectly that many other barbers couldn’t do, did wait quite a bit for the cut but it was worth it. The people are very polite and professional. Will definitely be coming back every week for my cut!< /Text>

It's an okay haircut but the price is comparable to what's out there and they are quick about it. Don't expect anything great, which most guys don't. I do enjoy the triple play or whatever it's called, with shampoo and hot towel.. though the vibrating thing on my shoulders doesn't do much. The lighting is blinding, but I guess that's part of their sports shtick.</text>

My son got a hair cut here today, and Anna did an amazing job.  My son hates getting his hair cut, he says it hurts, and as soon as the clippers touch his head he winces and starts crouching down to escape the trimmers.  Today was the 1st time he loved getting his hair cut. He didn't grimace once, and he said afterward it didn't hurt at all.  The store was clean, the staff was friendly, and best of all my son left happy.  Not to mention since he was comfortable, and sat still, it was probably the best haircut he's ever had! We will def be back!< /text>

Been coming here for 6 months and wouldn't go anywhere else. Customer service is always excellent on the phone and at the front desk. I always ask for Lori to style my hair, since she has always cut it to my liking and knows exactly what I wanted since the first time. She makes anyone feel welcome, always makes sure the place is clean, and does a fantastic job managing the store.  She has also recommended great products for hair care.< /text>

<Review>No issues. Came here to get my son a cut.  San diego is pricey as it is. So kinda dislike how expensive a simple boys cut is. wish they had a cheaper price for kids under 12 or something. But my son likes the cut and hot towel, and sometimes massage in the senior varsity and mvp package.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><name>Jennifer Martinez< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5< /rating></record>

Been going here for years... good haircut, sportscenter on the TVs, and the girls are always friendly.  They get busy so call ahead to check on the wait time.  Tip: get the MVP, but bypass the shoulder massage and they'll do double hot towel with scalp massage... so relaxing you'll almost fall asleep!< /text>

<Review>Hannah was very attentive as always. Most of the barbers are always very professional and helpful, but she took the extra time to trim my eyebrows and ear hair. Not all of them do that. She is one of your best.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The staff at Fenton is great, I have been by there a few times and they always know what I like based on my history. They are also super close to a Starbucks, so even if there is a wait, I can put my name down and get a coffee. It's a great place to get a haircut.;</Review>

<text>Over priced for the quality of cut. Maybe 2 barbers who are good. Poorly managed...Showed up at 10:05am on a Sunday for a cut and doors weren't even open yet. Customers and barbers were waiting outside of the shop for a manager to show and open the shop but none of the employees could even reach the manager. Embarrassing for them really...If you're going to pay $30+ for a haircut go to Floyd's 99 down the street.< /text><Response>{'time': 1505598147776, 'text': "Hey Joe,\nI'm sorry that you had the experience you did. We send our team members to regular training which includes client experience standards, so stuff like not opening on time shouldn't happen.

It would have been nice if someone had looked up, said hello and asked me to sign in as is standard customer service for a barber shop.  I figured out that I needed to sign in on my own.  My haircut was uneven and much shorter than what I asked for.  I was offered the MVP package for the standard price as a first time customer, but passed.  If a barber is not able to give a quality basic hair cut I am not interested in accepting a massage or hot towel treatment from said barber.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d95509ef509db7:0x233614ff2f36dcd9<//gmap_id></record>

Ivana has been my stylist for quite some time now.  I just love her.
She goes to extremes to cut my hair the way I want done.
She's definitely an asset to Sport Clips.</review>

<Review>I have gone out of my way to come here. I avoid the one by my house. However, this place has just become a factory. Move one person into a chair and move onto the next. I had a terrible haircut. She did not listen... At all. This used to be my go to place. Never coming back. All they do is ask if you want it shorter. Obviously. Alas, I will go to a solan, this is not a assembly line. Good luck if you go.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Had my hair cut by ( May) on 8-19-18.
She did a terrible job and was a snot the whole time she was cutting my hair.
What a hack.
If you get a haircut here don't use May.< /Text>

Don't honor coupons as they say it it is not their location but cant tell you where the location is even though it came in the mail with you location on coupon.Service was slow at Poway waited 30 minutes , the stylist was not very experienced but was pleasant.< /review>

Just simply delicious!  I have a thing for the Smoked Chicken Bahn Mi, the yummy Reuben, and Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Every time I stop by, the brisket is sold out!  I can't wait to finally have some sliced brisket. Kids love the Mac n' Cheese.   I like the Potato Salad and spicy Cole Slaw. Excellent IPA on tap.  Well worth a trip out to the coast. Pick up some barbecue and watch the sunset. Or just enjoy a beautiful drive down the coast.  I admit  It doesn't always make it home. It's hard to resist nibbling.</text>

But the corn bread was the best, even took some home (wait for the take out was sooo long and there were not a lot of people)! Restroom in the building. Outdoor seating was available. Great location, short walk to the beach. Lots of street parking. Will definitely come back.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

*Great Covid Precaution August 2020* - Outdoor seating available: 3 tables in the front and 4 tables in the back (parking lot). Everyone stands in line, one party is allowed to go inside the store at a time. When the food is ready, your number will be called and you pick it up at a separate window. Every employee is wearing a mask.

Shout out to Sydiney, who was busy taping up signs before they opened but still manage to give up some tips and recommendations :)

+Star of the show is the brisket (5 stars). This is coming from a person who almost never likes brisket. The brisket is truly tender, easier cut through with a plastic forks.

+Banh Mi sandwich with ribs (4 stars) - It showed up in burger buns, so I ate it like it was a burger. It had a ton of meat, very satisfying. However, the pickled carrot lacked flavor, maybe the homemade pickles are a better option to make it taste more like a banh mi.

+Sides: Beans & greens (black-eyed peas with collars green and sausage, yum!) and potato salads (strong rosemary fragrance, not your typical one).

-Sausage was good, pulled pork was tender but nothing special, and ribs were not as fatty nor tender and fall-off-the-bone as I expected.

In short, an exciting addition to the BBQ scene, especially in Half Moon Bay. They just opened in April, so come and give it a try.

Tips:
1) Pour the tangy BBQ sauce all over everything
2) You can buy a quarter pound of pulled pork instead of half a pound
3) The line is short (or non-existent) during cold days</Text>

<Text>Loved this place! The food was ready less than 10 minutes after we ordered in person and the lady who took my order was really nice and helpful. We ordered a brisket sandwich, 8oz Mac and cheese and a salad. It was enough for two people and everything was delicious! The sandwich was sooo flavorful and the meat had the perfect texture. The highlight though was the salad which was unexpected and just delightful!! Will definitely be back to try more.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I am not usually a fan of mustard but the mustard and apple slaw made the sandwich! The cornbread with maple butter and coarse salt was delicious! Definitely try it when you go! The owner Wyatt came out to talk to us and check on how everything tasted. If you’re ever in the area make sure to stop by and support this local business.

<Text>What a find! I found this place serendipitously. I just happened to be bicycling in the area. My loss. I wish I had found this place years ago. 1st of all they're very clean and the service is excellent. The barbecue is superb. Could be the best in the area. Could be the best in the Bay area.

Oh man this place is THE BEST! I can't pick a favorite but the short ribs melt in your mouth, the brisket is perfect and the sides are all so good I usually end up ordering extra. This is literally the most exquisite smoked meats and bbq. Once you have had you will be hooked and will be craving it all the time!!! The service is fun, super friendly and good to look at ;) They serve great local beer and my whole family loves it!<//Text>

I’ve been waiting years for a good barbecue spot in Half Moon Bay and finally it’s here. The staff at Breakwater bbq couldn’t be any more enjoyable and the food is always hitting the spot. Make sure to order more than you can eat so you have leftovers. These guys know what their doing, five stars all the way around.< /text>

The brisket is cooked to perfection and the ribs fall right off the bone.
If you’re lucky enough to see the mobile smoker while your picking up your grub make sure to check it out. The perfect merge of mobility, metal and meats.🔥< /Text>

Buddies in the bay area told me of Breakwater. Ended up driving from Santa Cruz just to try it. The ribs and brisket are insanely delicious. Do not make the mistake of missing out on the cornbread. I ate most of the maple butter with my fork and had to ask for more. Breakwater BBQ is the real deal!!! Tip -  join their email list and order early. They can sell out days before pick-up.<//text>

<date>1593989793909</date><rating>5</rating><Text>I am parked outside Breakwater Barbecue, just finished 1/2 BBQ Chicken.  This was my 2nd time here.  The first time had ribs, meat cooked to perfection but didn't care for the clear consistency sauce.  Tried again today with the chicken.  The chicken itself was tender and moist from outside in.  Skin was coated in herbal seasoning that shot this BBQ Chicken to top of the class.  As if that wasn't enough, the creamy herbal mayo dipping sauce shot this BBQ Chicken off the charts, this establishment stands alone in it's league.  I like 3 Pigs but bad timing they opened a location on Main St., HMB there is no comparison.  The owners of Breakwater BBQ must be driven by relentless passion and perfection for all things BBQ.  My flavor sensors were doing the happy dance.
And today found out there are 2 BBQ sauce options for the ribs, next time will try the red sauce.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Drove by today saw no line stopped in not busy at all.
Over a half hour standing in the cold and wind waiting for my order. Zero urgency to get the very few orders out.
I am so unhappy no matter how the food is this place will never ever be on my menu.
Hate to give a review like this to a local business but if you do a bad job and dont care this is what you earn.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Got a meal to go this Sunday. We got brisket two sides and a chef salad. I’ve traveled the U.S. sampling bbq and breakwater bbq has the best brisket I’ve had. Better than Texas. Better than at st Louis. It was fork cut tender with awesome flavor. The bbq sauce was served on the side and while good frankly I didn’t use it as the brisket flavor was so awesome. The four sides were Mac and cheese which was spicy and better than almost all others in the area. Dad’s luncheonette also has an exceptional Mac and cheese but they are both very different. The beans were great with good flavor and nice blend so not the usual red beans. The corn bread and maple spread was the item we should have ordered two of. It is really good. The chef salad was refreshing and a very creative and original with Faro in it. Two of us split the meal for $30 but we should have ordered two corn breads. I highly recommend breakwater bbq< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I didn't have a good experience this year. I usually do. The fired my favorite tax preparer 2 years ago. This was my first year in business as a handyman. I thought the  "tax professionals" would have detailed info on my taxes, the write offs I should be eligible for, and tell me if I missed anything. After all, the promise of getting your maximum refund indicates they know what they are doing. But this "pro" brushed all of my questions off with general dead end statements that clarified nothing. They avoided going into specific details on anything. When I asked her a series of direct questions (like why am I paying $2000.00 on $7000.00 of unemployment, they didn't know anything. They told me "I don't know, I just enter the information in the computer and it does the work for me." I'm certain that there are write offs that I missed. I'm probably going to get audited because they didn't allow me to upload my invoices, or any proofs of income at all besides a 10-99 from a company I did sub-contracting work for. They charged me over $600 and I am done. I have used H&R block for 5 straight years. The "pro" I used should be fired. I'm never going back to this location again.

Edit:

Automated apology definitely NOT accepted. Nobody from H&R read this.<//text>

John, the gentleman I have used for 2 years now, is always kind and welcoming. He doesn't complicate the process or try to over explain tax policies. I get peace of mind knowing that my taxes are filed properly.</text>

Great bar that has a pool table, music, good food and stiff drinks. It's an old firehouse and the inside has tons of character and charm. Service was great as well. Definitely recommend.< /Review>

The dive bar tour continues, the road goes on forever and the party never stops.
Love genuine bars and this is one, no pretenses, just good drinks, pool and music.</text>

<review>Always a good spot to stop for a drink or a quick bite...especially if you're on a ride on Hwy 9. Regulars are friendly and usually a decent band on the weekends when the doors are fully open without social distancing.< /review>< name>

Small but fun dance floor surrounded by five or six tables. Back porch area is covered and has portable heaters setup for cold mountain evenings.

<Review>If you like biker dive bars in the mountains, this place has what you're looking for. There's a digital jukebox, lots of beers on tap, cool dive bar-y decor, and plenty of locals in flannel and jean vests! It's a great stop after a hike in the redwoods. Wish I'd found it years ago!< /Review><rating>5< /rating><date>1548737920312< /date>< name>

I rode out to Capitola last weekend with other bikes and the group decided that we would stop at Henflings on the way home. It's  been closed for a while and we wanted to see it's new groove. The front and inside are still the same. 🌞💚 cool old bar and stage for local live music and good food.  No more horseshoe pit though. 😪 the horseshoes were my favorite part. Still a great stop on a beautiful ride through the coastal redwoods.<//text>

<Review>UPDATED: After thinking about the reply from the owner, I can agree that my review is not fair to what will be a different business, same name. I endured the place for many, many years as it was. If the owner is sincere about being mindful of their upcoming staff, and I have no reason to think they are not, then they deserve a chance to bring to our town their vision of Henfling's without being tainted by old baggage.

I changed this one star to three. When you open, I look forward to meeting you. I hope to give a stellar review one day. Not for the review's sake, but, because good communities thrive when they have good businesses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Closed, currently, while ownership is transferred and required repairs completed, Henfling’s is rumored to reopen in September or October of 2018. When it does, I hope they implement something called customer service, preferably through employees that aren’t consistently unpleasant and hostile. The food here is over the top good. The women behind the bar are the worst of the Valley. YMMV.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1531339205918, 'text': "I do not feel your one star review is a fare rating as for reasons you mentioned we are closed for renovations, and the issues that you are referring to will be handled.

Henfling's is a great place to hang out with friends! Music could be quieter when there's not a band, but otherwise great to chill there.< /Text>

<Review>You can't go wrong with a dive bar with good food. Serving the simplest of steaks and burgers, a good collection of booze. To enjoy yourself make sure you are comfortable with a loud crowd that seem to know each other.
There is regularly a rock band playing. A smoking section out back.
This is not a place for quite and peace. And it might be a little intimidating.<//Review>< Pics>

It's a dive bar, let's be honest. But the food is BOMB. And they get live music with no cover. They had a nice selection on tap, but ladies probably won't like the bathrooms.<//review>

The new renovations in late 2018 really brought this place up to par. It looks basically the same, but the bathrooms are much nicer, the floor is much more level, and the place is just all around cleaner and feels more "solid", while still retaining the distinct, cozy, mountain cabin charm that has always been an intrinsic characteristic of Henflings (aka "Chicken Toss"). Upgrades to the kitchen and bar were welcome and due, and 8ts nice to sit on new, padded, upholstered, swivel barstools.
I went on a "soft open" Wednesday shortly after they reopened, and had a good time playing "Flingo" (Henflings Bingo). Of course, mostly everyone else there knew everyone else, but it wasn't my first time at that rodeo, and both my smile and my cowboy hat seemed well received. And everyone just seemed happy to be back in their local after almost a year closed.
BTW, I have seen some GREAT musical performance at Henfings. The mountains are rife with talented and seasoned musicians, and this is a great, tiny venue to experience them, while practically dancing on their toes and guitar chords.< /Review>

Not just because it's two blocks away from my place, but because the attendants are chill, and they have a good variety of drinks and snacks. The older attendant that wears glasses gives you some attitude, his customer service skills could use some refreshing, but he's whatever. The other guys are funny.

Cant say anything on their hot food, I've never bought any.

The place has never looked untidy on the inside when I've been there, always kept clean and well stocked.

a Taco truck recently started setting up shop on their parking lot and their tacos are pretty bomb.</Review>< pics>

$4 for one bottle water says it's all.. Watch their pricing.. Got two smart waters and they rang up at $8!! only giving it a two star because the gas is convenient since they switch to brand gas I won't be buying anything from inside any longer.<//Text>

<Text>Liquor, beer, cigarettes, scratchers, and all other pit stop paraphernalia is available here. Milk, eggs, cereal, bread, tortillas, cheese, hot dogs, microwave burritos/sandwiches, and other "convenience" food items are always in stock. Customer service is on point. Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the slightly higher price point for gasoline and a few other items in store.</Text>< Pics>

I love ABE's! They are so friendly, always pleasant and helpful to all customers. I live nearby and can stop in anytime to get essentials or just a drink and gas. They have just about EVERYTHING you may need- Hats, phone chargers, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, fountain drinks, sodas, beer, hard alcohol, wine, tampons, toilet paper, first aid supplies, candy, toys, cereal, some foods- frozen, refrigerated, prepared & hot foods. Like I said they got just about everything you could want &/or need! Good place right here been coming since I was a little girl- about 5 years old- ALWAYS good!<//text>

Electric went out after I paid for gas, employee acted like he was doing me a favor returning my money because the pump would not work.  Had a fit because he had to open the register manually.< /Review>

Horrible first time experience I usually don’t write reviews Bc it takes a lot time, but I’m taking the time to write this one. The cashier/owner must be racist. I walked in to pay for my gas letting the cashier know that chip reader was not working so I need to slid my card. I did everything he ask and all I kept hearing from him was “Come on, I thought u Asians were smart 5x and some other smart comments.” I’m a very humble guy so I brushed it off but times like these it boils by blood. I will never recommend this place to anyone please stay away. I don’t understand how this place even has 5 star reviews u people are blind!< /Review>

< review>
Usually low prices on gas here, for some odd reason - per the GasBuddy app I use. I like that there's a lot of room for parking at the gas pumps and in front of the store & lots of room for bigger cars like  the Diesel trucks. There's a vacuum station & air station, but I haven't used them yet. It's also easy to get in & out - located on Barstow street where traffic is usually light.

You can pay at pump (accepts debit & credit cards) or pay inside the store. Beware there is a fee for using debit & credit cards inside the store though.

They carry Valero gasoline BTW.

I've had only good experiences here. The clerks are friendly. Lines are short & fast moving. Good selection of quick (or to-go) foods, drinks & candy. Prices are ok - definitely less than 7-Eleven.</review>

Their gas price is reasonable but their alcohol prices are astronomical! Also they increase their prices once a product becomes popular. But I guess that's just good business<//Review>

<review>This liquor store accepts food stamps, (SNAP), for many items in the store, but in my experience and from what others tell me, they overcharge when you use food stamps.  Usually it is a few dollars more to buy with food stamps, but the other day my brother went in to buy a $2-ish item and $100 was missing from his balance afterward, leaving him with five cents!  I will never shop here for anything in the future, and hopefully others will see this too.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

I give this park one star because the soap dispenser in the bathrooms do not work and they look like they are completely broken and have never worked! I will not use the bathroom here again! Very unsanitary<//Text>

Only 4 stars because of the lack of big trees for shade & small parking lot!! If it's the weekend, you can park in Pioneer's  school parking lot across the street. If it's hot, there's no relief from the sun on abusy day!!  One large,covered eating area at the entrance. Park is clean, great play area for the kids, not a homeless people mecca, restrooms during the day, benches to sit, paved sidewalks, & gas station next door to buy water, snacks, etc.< /text>

It's a nice park a place to ride bikes, scooters you can climb the rocks and have a picnic and enjoy the Sun. And my grandson Nathan loves it he is 4 years old.</text>

<Review>I took in my Toyota Camry to have the back bumper repaired, and tell me you. The service was GREAT, the staff was friendly and professional! They did an amazing job on my vehicle, and made it look like brand new! Besides the great work they did, they went the extra step and DETAILED my whole car OUTSIDE AND INSIDE!

These guys are absolutely fantastic. They took care of my car in a timely manner and were very communicative, as well as professional and friendly, through the whole process. If I could give them 10 Stars, I would give them 15. Thanks guys!<//Review>

Caliber Collision was awesome. I was rear-ended and they took care of literally everything. Robert and Kate were amazing, very communicative and fast. My car looks brand new! They do great work and treat their clients like family. They made a stressful situation so easy. I will absolutely be back, so glad I decided to go with Caliber. Thank you guys for everything!< /Text>

I was reared ended and when I called I spoke with Andrew and he right away explained everything that I needed to know.  He was the one, that helped me through the whole job.  I was very satisfied with his help and my car was done before the date given.  I really  recommend Caliber Collision.< /text>

<Review>I've never been to Caliber Collision, this was my first time going with them and I'm really happy I did. The staff there are so helpful and very attentive to what you need. I didn't have to go through any hassles, I simply made an appointment, got it inspected, then fixed quickly! The staff in the front office let me know of the whole process, and when they say they'll call me back over the phone, they really do! My car was left great, and was even washed for me! So happy I came here. Really great customer service here.

I was really happy with the work they did on my vehicle until the light hit it at the right angle.   I brought ot back so they could buff out the swirl lines. They worked on it for about 30 minutes and it still had some.  I was going to take it back again but decided not to.  I also noticed that the side view mirror had a good scratch on it that did not buff out like they said it would.  I also noticed on the inside of the vehicle where they took off the side view mirror had two gouges in the plastic cover.  I will not be taking my vehicle here again.  I shouldn't have to be bringing it back so they could do a good job, it should be done right the first time.< /Text>

They walked me through all the paperwork and even called the rental company to come pick me up.

My daughter's vehicle was repaired at  Blythe  location. There’s nothing they can’t fix on your car, and they were timely and gracious to work with regardless of how big or small the job is. They’re a busy shop, but they always take the time to explain and go through all the options with you. Office team was supper nice, intelligent, competent, honest, get things done on time, really well. They pay attention to details. I recommend them!< /review>

Stay away from this place. Quality control is very bad. They forgot to plug in connection to rear window. Had to get that fixed by myself. Body bolt stuck in my rear tire. Had to get that fixed. Just stay away.<//Review>

I took my car in for repairs. The secretary was friendly but the manager was rather rude and shirt tempered. As he was looking at the small damaged area he kept telling me to go inside. I thought when you get an estimate that they walk you through the picture taking. So finally I went inside but I was uneasy about it. While inside I heard a loud sound like something being hit. When I left the place there was a different type of white on my car and above the wheel there was damage, where before there was no damage.  The manager there is not honest, he is dishonest.< /review>

My mom went there to get her car fixed. After she got her vehicle back, the RPMs were at 2000 on idle, the engine sounded horrible, and the car itself just did not drive right. We are not going back again.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place for its poor customer service and not taking responsibility for its workers. Your car is not safe in this location.

(Original)
No recomiendo este lugar por su mal servicio al cliente y no asumir la responsabilidad de sus trabajadores. Su carro no está seguro en esta localidad.<//Review>

I lived in bellflower, in downey and now LA .... there was a confusion today with the bread that keria conchitas and they gave me shells, I just turned around and told Mrs. ... that I did not want to change, explain to her She could see that I didn't do anything to her and I didn't want to change them .... well bad she said ps if you want to bring more money and you give more ... I was at the door that my daughter asked and in the car she had the baby I was asleep so I could not enter the bakery and leave alone or send my daughter alone ..... anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️

<time>1584236421635< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Casey's in Madera has taken the footprint of an establishment having roots dating back to some of the earlier commercial ventures in town. The former Skeeko's Bar occupied this same corner, and what a story that corner can tell.

Casey's management has built on their successes in Fresno County, providing Madera City and County a nice place for hanging out, having good food, and sharing good times with friends.

From week-night after work cold refreshments, cocktail dinners, to Bloody Mary breakfasts or sports shows afternoons, Casey's has it all.<//review>< Pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>We have NEVER had a bad experience at Casey's.  This place is wonderful. You can tell a lot of thought went into the way the place is laid out. The bar (and table seating) is far enough away from the stage that you can have a conversation without yelling. The dance floor is spacious, and still close enough to the band that you get the "intimate" music experience people look for. The manager, Jamie, is incredible. I can't say enough good things about this place, but I CAN say we will definitely be back!!<//Review>< userid>

We stopped by to try this place Jamie was great! The building on the outside might not  look like much but the inside had unique ambiance . She mentioned breakfast on Sunday from 9-11 am  price around $10 plus tax ( pork chops etc ) well guess what we’re going to try it !😊<//review>

I feel like I have more energy. I don’t know how to quantify it though.

I’m a 78 year old male who has several serious medical issues. Among them bypass (5 blockages) surgery ‘91, a single kidney (born that way) that is stage 3 disease, 3 heart attacks, and the various associated heart disease conditions. I also have severe back issues.

I enjoy woodworking and gardening. This is where I feel I have more energy to getting things done. I enjoy making wooden toys for charity. I wish I had more than anecdotal data beyond a feeling. I am happy with these early results. I will continue with this supplement. If I can continue to work standing for longer periods I’ll try and quantify that by a number of minutes longer. For example, yesterday I tilled the fall garden and only had to rest once. Whereas before I would have taken 3 or 4 breaks. In the “old” days I could till that plot with no breaks. I’d like to get back to that.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have noticed more energy. Yesterday my wife and I , went to Costco, she is handicapped, requiring wheelchair or electric cart. I wear a wristwatch monitor & logged more than two miles nearly 5,000 steps, in addition of course I must actually put everything in the basket, & unload all at home before putting it all away, as well as prepare meals, I' m 76.
I also used to get up every two hours for the bathroom, I'm now sleeping 6-8 hours straight before getting up.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Hello! I am turning 68 this summer and I've been taking teleogenesis  for quite awhile.  I want to do everything I can to slow down the process of the telomeres  shrinking with age! I would not want to be without it!  It has kept me so sharp, and enabled me to learn and maintain new information so quickly.  I am truly grateful for this product.  Thank you!< /Review>

Hi Sir, I am a 72 year old retiree and recent doctoral graduate from Regent University.I am writing to let you know that the capsules I ordered from you are doing me well. I am up to "good" at this point, working towards "excellent," as I am continuing to take the capsules on a regular basis. I have only had the capsules less than 30 days, so it's taking at least that time for me to get to closer to excellent, maybe a little more for me to really feel the "full effect" of the capsules. Thank you so much!<//text>

So far, I'm most impressed with your infomercial. I haven't had anything groundbreaking, but my wife thinks her sight has gotten better because of it. I could give her a placebo,though and tell her it cost a lot of money and she'd realize something improved. Personally, I think you info makes alot of sense, I'm being patient and I believe there will be benefits eventually. Something that legitimate doesn't happen overnight. I personally am not rich, i try to be responsible and make sure all of our needs are taken care of. I get paid next week, so I'll wait til you email me 6 for 168. If we can't get it for that, then unfortunately, we can't get it at all. You should be very proud of your contribution, though, I believe if you take it religiously, after a while there will be long lasting benefits. Your info seems to prove that!< /review>

Since using Telogenesis, I've noticed less senior moments. or if I walk into a room and forget why I'm there, I can wait a few seconds and then it comes back to me. YAY! I can better keep track of my sets while working out at home too!< /text>

I have been taking Telogenisis for one month.  My skin feels firmer and I seem to have a little more energy.  I am hoping for more results in the next month.  I have an eye injury and a knee injury.  My knee does seem more flexible.<//text>

i am feeling well. My arthritic knee seems to be feeling better (though warmer weather may be part of that). I have lost a little weight and my tummy seems a little flatter. that's about it for now. Oh and my skin feels nicer.</review>

I am in my second month of pills. I do believe that my joint pain is less intense and I also feel less brain fog, better concentration, and a little more energy.  I only hope these small changes will even be more significant after my 3 month.  I am unsure right now if I will be able to afford it regularly,  I feel good enough about the product that I will not use their 90 day guarantee for a refund. I am happy with the results so far.< /text>

It is easier to plan and undertake both physical and mental activities. And, just this week, I noticed that I don't seem to need a long afternoon nap. That was a startling realization.
Finally, I am losing some weight and my appetite seems to be normalizing - not so much craving for carbs and sugar. I want to pay more attention to see how these changes evolve and deepen, but so far, I am (cautiously) delighted with the positive changes I am noticing.<//review>< Resp>

I have been using your product for almost a month. I take it in the morning. After a few days,  I noticed increased energy and a feeling better each morning.
I'm a diabetic on blood thinners.  My A1C is  under 7. Dealing with hip replacement surgery  pending.  The same thing happened to my older brothers. I need to work on my exercise skills and walking  more.  I'll turn 76 this summer. I am very happy with my pills and ordered more  this morning.

Keep up the good work. THANKS.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Well I’m coming up on only one month of using this product. I have two more months to go. I’m usually a pretty energetic person, I have a job that keeps me on the go. Two months ago I broke my knee cap in half so I am totally immobile. I was hoping my energy level would not plummet, so far it hasn’t.
Now is this the result of the telogenesis, not sure but I’m willing to keep taking it. Also I thought I would gain a lot of weight but so far only a little and probably due to my eating habits
Could this be the result of this supplement, not sure but again I’m willing to continue.
Check in with me in another month or two!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I also started several new amino acids about the same time. I am not sure which are working and if they are working in combo.  However I am very pleased with my new focus and follow through. I was forgetting words and thoughts right and left. Much, much improvement. Thank you, Johnna<//text>

<text>The only change I can tell since taking the Telogenesis is I’ve been sleeping better. And I don’t recall that being a benefit. It could be coincidence.
I have many mechanical issues, such as knee and back pain, that it has not helped those issues. I’ve not been sick with anything, but then my immunities are pretty good. I can’t tell, obviously,  what might be improving internally. So nothing negative to report. And minimal positive.  I continue on. But may not eventually.< /text>< pics>

I haven't finished the first bottle, but I do feel that the pains in my feet are less than they were and my energy levels don't rise and dip as much.  I do sleep much better than I did before starting the Telogenesis and am looking forward to seeing this improvement continue.  Cold days still has my arthritis in my toes and bone spurs on my heels hurting if my feet are allowed to get cold, but if I wear socks or slippers the pain seems to be minimal.  After years and years of pain, this is amazing.  I look forward to seeing if there is more improvement over time.  Even if there isn't, this product has kept me on my feet longer each day and with so much less pain.  I am so glad I found it!</text>

<review>I just received the package with LCR shipment few days ago. Canada Post has been so slow these days due to COVID 19. I started taking the supplement right away and have noticed almost instantly a great improvement in my health, mood, and, most importantly, in my cognitive ability. For example, I played bridge with my daughter and grandkids last night and could remember all cards and all tricks.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The first night I took this supplement I wasn’t expecting much to happen. However, two weeks later, I am consistently feeling the effects of significantly less back pain from my two herniated discs. For this reason alone, I rate this a 5 star product. Amazing, amazing, amazing!</review>

I’ve been using Telogenesis consistently for 2 weeks. I was super surprised—from day 1 (and even before I started being consistent)—to find an IMMEDIATE, noticeable boost in my energy level. I really don’t think it’s supposed to work that fast, but it’s undeniable. And my memory has improved—the reason I made the purchase in the first place. A active grandma with a still-going-strong psychotherapy practice, I need all the help I can get to get my mind and body strong.< /text>

I started using your product a little before Christmas.  I have to say that I have noticed I am not as overcome with tiredness as I was and at the same time feel a little more energy.  Very subtle but I am encouraged. I also enjoy and get a great deal from your newsletters. Thank you< /review>

I have not been on this product for a full month yet. However, I have noticed a vast improvement on my energy levels. Almost as if I was a 20 years old again. To give a full description of what I mean, is that as a 20 year old, I could function on little to no sleep the entire day. Prior to this, I found I would have to take naps, and feel sluggish. While I do value sleep, and I do try to sleep at a decent time and for enough time, on those days that I go to bed at 2am or 3am...or even 5am, I find no difficulty getting up at 7am. This includes post working out energy levels and even after eating. I’m not bound by the feeling of food coma or anything. The recovery time, or rather DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) is hardly a nuisance, even though I find myself pushing harder and heavier. At this time, these are the most noticeable effects of Telegenesis that I can document. Overall, I am extremely delighted with it. I Feel like I do need to state, that I do take additional supplements, however since taking the Telegenesis, all the effects are profoundly more impactful.< /review>

<review>LCR has helped me drop past the weight I could not seem to get past. I have seem in a few weeks my size go from 14 to 10. I do not weigh myself, I measure my weight goals by dress sizes and I feel great. It is so inspiring to accomplish something that seemed impossible at my age and I feel that inspiration everyday now. It fuels me to do more.< /review><name>aliea moore< /name></record></dataset><record>

I have mostly bone and joint issues at 74. But I also have lymph edema resulting from cancer surgery. I believe the astragulus in your formula has significantly cut the swelling in my feet. I am not clear yet about improvements to my joints since I take other medications. I take a lot of supplements but am careful with herbs since I am allergic to some of them. So far so good.< /Text>

I sorry but your emails were going to a spam file put Tim my husband or 43 yrs is using it to, we are both 60 so on to be 61, we just ran out of our 3 month each supply and we would really love to keep taking it, but we are on a very tight budget and we could handle paying $160 for a 3 month each that is a 6 month amount 6 bottles 3 for him and 3 for me. I'd rob a bank put then they would put me in prison and I've been married to Tim for 43 yrs and I just could not live without him. I'm just trying to tell you just how good this medication is for me and my husband is has gave us back some of our youth. Please see fit to help us.  Margaret Huston<//text>

I was turned on to LCR Health and Dr.Rand McClain by a relative.  The product I tried was Active Pk.  I tried it for 4 months and was really happy with the results. I signed up for auto ship every 90 days.  This is where it all gets aggravating and annoying.  I had to use a new credit card and did so online.  It stated my transaction was declined yet it double my card in real time that I could monitor. I called into customer as was rudely told it declined and that it was my problem and needed to contact my bank!!!  After saying no it’s not and requested to be connected to a supervisor, I was speaking to Julia who then miraculously reversed the double charge.  Fast forward to today when I called to place an order for two products.  The lady said she would have to run the card separate for each order as one was a sale product which was fine.  As I am watching my card online.....  they double charge the one order and skip the other???  When I call back in I get hung up on???  I call back and speak to Dillon who seems annoyed with me.  After being on hold he states the initial rep entered the order wrong and we needed to do it again.  When I asked if he could assure it wouldn’t be double billed he could not???  So I canceled the remaining order and will no longer buy from them.  I understand I am only a 200 hundred customer every 90 days but it’s clear this company is so rich  and so entrenched up On the ivory tower they don’t care whatever with customer experience    Way to go LCR Health!!  Keep up the great work!!  Kick Rocks!<//text>

I had just mentioned to my husband how good I have been feeling, I have had lots of energy and my mind has been so clear. I”m 78 years old and my energy level was low and my mind was very foggy,
Than I realized I had started using telogenesis 3 weeks ago for the first time. I had only ordered 30 day supply to try it out.
Looks like I will order more because for me I do believe it works!<//Review>

<text>Telogenisis is one of a combination of products I regularly use from LCR Health.  Individual effects are hard to determine specifically but with the overall regime I feel 20 years younger and have been able to enjoy golf six days a week and working out at the gym 5 days a week.

<Text>I was really feeling fatigue during the day, no energy at all, really discouraging, I work full-time and some days were really hard. I have been taking Telogenesis for about 2 weeks and I feel great, I have a spring in my step, going up and down stairs a lot easier, and moving around easier. I’m thrilled. I’m 65 and feel alive!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I took supplements and within a few days I noticed the feeling in my hip and groin slowly getting less painful not saying it has gone but I'm having some of the best sleeps I've had for awhile. but seem to be going to the toliet a lot more than often  Maybe a body change ?    Will continue to use until finished dosage< /Review>< gmapID>

I'm 38 years old & I've been on Telogenisis for a few weeks now. I have definitely noticed an increase in energy, & that was my goal! Excited to see how I feel, after a couple months. Something unexpected...I was losing a lot of hair daily & I couldn't explain it. A week into using Telogenisis & the hair loss had resumed to normal levels! Thanks, Nicolle!< /text>

<text>I have enjoyed the results from taking Telogenesis. I have more energy, stamina, and mental acuity. I have multiple problems and perhaps continued use of this product would result in greater relief. Unfortunately, I have a limited income and cannot afford Telogenesis.

THIS PRODUCT HAS WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME, ESPECIALLY ENERGY AND MENTALLY. I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANXIETY FOR MANY YEARS AND IT HAS HELPED SO MUCH WITH THIS. REALLY KEEPS ME CALM AND HAVE A BETTER OUTLOOK IN MY LIFE. I HAVE SUFFERED SO MANY YEARS WITH DEEP EMOTIONS OF GRIEF FOR LOSS FOR MY SON WHO WAS KILLED AT 16 YEARS OF AGE. AND I THINK THIS PRODUCT HAS HELPED ME TO COPE SOME BETTER. MANY PROBLEMS OVER ALL THESE YEARS OF SICKNESS ALSO, BUT MY BODY HAS HEALED A LOT IN THE PAST YEARS EVEN BEFORE I STARTED TAKING THIS PRODUCT, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS GIVEN ME THE BOOST I NEED.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS PRODUCT OF TELE-GENIUS. I WANT TO TAKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME TO KEEP ME GOING EVERYDAY. I AM 79 YEARS OF AGE.</review>

< review>
I have been dealing with low energy for many years due to menopausal symptoms and going through a stressful work and home situation 4 years ago.  It was frustrating coming home and being exhausted and not having any energy over  the weekend to do all the personal projects I wanted to accomplish.  I have been searching for something to help me.  I stumbled upon the presentation by Dr Rand and the science behind Telogenesis and felt i needed to at least try it.   I have just completed a months worth of the product.    It’s hard to describe the changes because it’s not like drinking coffee where you feel the affects of the product immediately.    It’s a subtle change.   I found myself staying up longer.   Having no problem waking up in the morning without feeling groggy.  I’ve cleaned and organized my home and completed those nagging projects .  I signed up for a workout program that starts at 6 am.  I haven’t worked out in 9 years. I have way more energy!!  I feel younger.   My brain is functioning more clearly.  I am very satisfied with the results.</review>

<Text>I must say that since early 2000 I started using plant and herbal supplements from many companies but always in a stacking system and over a planned using time.  I am 70 this year but look 50.  I am a Natural Therapist with many modalities under my title and I always to be a walking talking bill board for my interuptation of physical and spiritual health.  I try to share what I can with my clients as that is the nature of my business and I always back up my Therapy with all sorts of exercises and stretches people can do from all walks of lilfe.  I never give people tasks what I cannot do myself.  I have a moderate success rate with mostly middle agers,  as the people in my age group do not want to know.  I back up your company and its supplements as it is the ongoing support mechanism of the stacking system I am on and your products are beautifully helping with contlinuing energy, stopping cravings, almost no pain in joints and hugely improving skin and hair.  No fatigue at all, and mood always positive and cheerful.    Memory is unbeatable.  Thank you so much  Kathleen< /Text>< Pictures>

I haven't taken a month supply yet but can't really notice any difference
as far as feeling better or having more energy etc.  I mean my energy
level is about the same.  I play tennis but really haven't noticed a significant change in how I feel or my energy etc.  Not sure what I should be experiencing having  taken this product.</Text>

< Review>
From taking the first capsule in the afternoon when they arrived, to just before I went to bed, I noticed that the pain in my arms had stopped and the tingling/pins and needles pain that I've had for over a year had also stopped. I had collapsed and fell badly and tried to save myself by putting my arms out in front of me. I didn't break anything, but the pain from this fall was pretty bad, And now it's gone. I expected it to return, but it hasn't.

I have had bad pain in my feet - it feels sometimes like my bones are coming through my skin. A weird and painful feeling, which gets worse when I'm in bed. This has also gone completely. I can't even explain the relief from this, it's just great.

My tinnitus hasn't gone, but it has lessened, and I'm hoping it will go completely. But, if not this quieter noise is easier to deal with. I just hope it doesn't come back!

This has all happened in just two weeks, and I am amazed and delighted. Thank you so much.
Toni

<review>I have been taking Telogenesis for a year and a half now and I feel better than ever! I don't have those little nagging aches and pains anymore, I wake up feeling good everyday and my face seems to look younger.  I'm not sure if it's all just the Telogenesis because I am taking several different LCR vitamins.  But I do know I look and feel younger since I've been taking vitamins from LCR, I have been told this from others as well.  I would and have highly recommend the LCR products.

I have taken Telogenisis for just about a month now. I know that I am sleeping much better and wake up with more energy than I had become accustom to over the last few years. I have not experienced the weight loss or bodily regeneration that was suggested, but I feel good enough to keep taking Telegensis. I am hoping the second bottle will yield even better results and the third will be even better than that.< /text>

Dear Dr. McClain:

I’ve been a pretty healthy and active person for most of my 74 years.  The last couple of those years, though, haven’t been so good.  I’m talking about a plethora of ailments, from pain to discomfort to just feeling “off” my game.  The past week or so, however, have taken a definite turn for the best in every area.  The only thing I’ve done different during that time, versus previous months, is taking the Telogenesis every morning.  While I’m still not 100%, every day seems to have been a little better than the one before.  Looking forward to seeing how I’m doing after a month on the Telogenesis.  That’s my honest report.

I went to see my doctor last week; she asked me if I was trying to lose weight. I mumbled something about being on a new thyroid medication. She informed me that  I had lost six pounds in twenty days. I really did not connect it to Tellogenics until a couple of days ago. I did a lot of research before purchasing the product. I was convinced it was my answer, for i had felt for some time that I was aging much more rapidly than I cared for. I believe Tellogenics is the answer to combatting this issue. I am very pleased with the product.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b982fc29b60d:0x4ae4d3594a913029< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

After one month of using Telogenesis I am almost 100% free of hip pain.
I am convinced this product is responsible for this improvement.
Thank you!</Review>

I'm an active cyclist a few times a week covering 10 to 20 miles regularly each time I ride. Plus I've been hitting the gym as much  body building or the past 4 years . At this point I notice more stamina and strength.<//Text>

<text>Since I have been taking Telogenisis, I have honestly felt more energetic and more focused than I have in years.  I have started several projects that I had put on the back burner for a long time.
I am seriously glad I started taking it!<//text>< pics>

Almost finished with first 30 day supply. Although I have not experienced noticeable weight loss,  I have experienced increased energy and sense of wellbeing. Just ordered 2nd bottle and will continue taking as long as I feel healthy. Will be 65 before year end, so the energy boost and wellness is positive, however weight loss .. not so much. Keeping an open mind going forward.  :)<//text>

I am blown away by how good I feel and how much better I am sleeping. My sleep got better on DAY 2. I could not believe it!. I have more energy, less depression and just feel better in every way. I have been taking it for almost a month now. I decided to detox ftom my thyroid med I have been on it continuouslt for 10 years *** MY CHOICE, I AM NOT RECOMMENDING ANYONE ELSE DO IT*** I have an appointment to check my TSH level on 11/20/19. So I can decide to go back on it or not. But, I do not feel tired or sluggish at all!! I am surprised because normally if I forget to take it, I would want to sleep all afternoon. I am really happy with Telogenesis so far.<//text>

<username>marie sasse</username><text>My husband and I are taking the supplement every day. The first three to four days, I experienced a few gastric discomforts, slightly off my norm but without something particular. I have Celiac Disease along with arthritic and back issues. My husband has arthritic problems also. Neither one of us had noticed any effects the first week in lessening pain issues, but I have to say we were taking less ibuprophen in week two. My GI problems appeared to get less and less by week two. Energy was more noticeably up, also for both of us.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><time>1568037805455</time><user>103313490488448445529< /user>< Rate>

i've been suffering with pain because of spinal stenosis.  I am feeling much better. Less pain, more energy, better sleep. I'm also feeling more motivated.
Telegenesis is not the only supplement I take but I have to assume it's helping.  Thank you for all that you do for your patients.<//Text>

< Review>
AMAZING COMPANY! My husband and I have been searching to buy a home for months. In this market, it's hard to even put in offer. It's become such a buyer's war. We were fortunate enough to have found a house after looking for so long. We were in a process of working with a lender and 3 weeks into it, the lender said they didn't know how to calculate my income. WOW! I was in such a panic state and had to search for another lender quick.  I remember Annie Lac and Derek Martin from my previous refinance with Owning. I rang them up right away and told them the scenario and they reassured me I was in good hands. They are a dream team! I can't thank them enough how well they pulled it all together for us at the last minute. They closed my purchase loan in 14 days!!! Thank you for putting us in our beautiful home!</Review>

< Review>
I recently refinanced with Owning.com. I have to say the experience was excellent. They gave a great rate, were very responsive and everything was done electronically. I closed in 3 weeks of starting the application - absolutely unheard of in the past. They knew what they were doing, there wasn't much back and forth and a notary came to my house to get signatures. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

My mortgage was quickly and accurately refinanced with Owning Corp.  The rate was at a competitive level 1.99%.  The process fit into my schedule.</Review>

I recently refinanced my home with OWNING.COM. When I read recent reviews, I was worried about my decision to refinance with them. Most of the reviews mentioned that their loan is not getting processed for months. After digging into it, I found that the main reason for delay in these cases were due to OWNING.COM merging with GUARANTEED RATE. When I first got in touch with NICK (Nicholas Ramirez) who is a mortgage specialist, I asked this question about delays in processing loans. He assured me that since the merger is completed, my loan will be closed quickly.

After NICK completed my initial application, my file was handed over to Kim H Tran (Loan Processor). From that point onwards it was smooth sailing. Kim was very proactive and was in touch with me throughout the whole process. My loan was closed in record time. I got an excellent rate with no closing cost. There was no surprise at any point. This was the fastest, smoothest and stress free refinancing experience compared to all my previous refinancing experiences. Although I may not need refinancing EVER AGAIN as this may be my last refinance (as advertised by owning.com)due to the excellent rate I got, I would use OWNING.COM without hesitation in future.

NICK and KIM, keep up the excellent job you are doing for your clients. My loan timeline was as follows.

4/30/2021 - Contacted Nick via phone  (He was ready to get details from me on the same day, but I could not do it because of my tight schedule. So I asked him to contact me on 5/2/2021)
5/2/2021 - Nick called me and we completed the application process.
5/3/2021 - Rate locked and file transferred to KIM. Provided him all the documents needed.
5/5/2021 - Minor enquiries from underwriter. I provided the required additional documents the same day.
5/6/2021 - Loan approved.
5/11/2021 - Signed loan papers with Notary.
5/17/2021 - Loan funded.< /review>

We're grateful for the ease we experienced while refinancing with Owning.com.  Graham Woolsey (Loan Officer) and Nikki Pelzi (Loan Processor) explained every step along the way and managed the overall process so quickly and efficiently that we were able to sign loan docs in less than 10 days after the application.   The new loan payment is roughly 75% the cost of our previous mortgage payment and we couldn't be happier.  Like to extend a heartfelt shout-out to Graham, Nikki and Owning corporation for their professional and very valuable service!</review>

<review>Owning.com far exceeded any expectations we had for our refinance experience. Less than two weeks after our initial interaction, our loan had funded. The required documentation was clearly defined and quickly processed. The communication between all parties was professional, friendly and productive.  It is fair to say that never have we experienced a mortgage transaction with this level of precise expertise and clarity. We had a horrendous experience last year attempting to refinance with another institution and, after 5 long and unproductive months, gave up. Owning.com has restored our faith in the institution.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If I could give them 6 stars I would.
Edgar Moreno and Steven Floyd were awesome. From day one, they communicated with me every step of the way. My husband had been on disability because he had surgery. Not a problem. They figured it all out. I provided the documentation needed and everything went well. Closing was quick and not a day was wasted when something wasn’t taken care of.
I got one of the lowest rates on the market and my mortgage payment went down about $420 a month.  Thank you for your honesty and shout out to Edgar and Steven. I’ll definitely be referring to friends and family.<//text>

Owning made my refinance experience really easy and fast. They were very professional and were always quick to answer any questions I had. I got a great interest rate, and the whole process was really fast. I signed the closing documents less than 2 weeks after submitting the loan application. The loan took a little longer to fund than originally planned, but everything worked out great and I couldn’t be happier with the whole experience.<//Text>

<Review>Ricky was very knowledgeable about the loan process and provided simple loan numbers for anyone to understand.  The list of documents was quick and easy to fulfill.  Elizabeth walked us along the process to the closing of the refinance.  The refinance was made so quick, easy, and painless.  At the end of the day it was a tie between their great rate and excellent service.  Owning made it so easy, it felt like you were just borrowing money from a friend, well they kind of become your friends because of their trusting, transparent, and friendly nature!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /Gmap_id>< user>

<review>I used Owning to refinance my home loan.  Their rates were the lowest,
there were no appraisal fees, loan costs were minimal, and the refinance process was completed within 30 days.  Customer service was second to none.  Loan agents always responded quickly to any requests.  They explained details clearly and were extremely efficient.  The loan process was done entirely online and was super easy.  They sent notary to my home to notarize documents which was awesome.  I saved $400 a month on the new loan.  I've refinanced several home loans in my life and Owning is hands down the best.  Recommend them 100%.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1615242070037, 'text': 'Glad to hear it Alex, thanks for the great and thorough review, we look forward to working with you again!'}<//response>< GmapID>

The worst loan experience I’ve ever had. Terrible mistakes made by multiple loan officers. Six months in, six different LO’s snd processors  working on our refinance, and I finally cancelled, losing my 2.1% rate. Painful!  The horrible customer service,  and incompetence of this company is truthfully unlike anything I’ve experienced.  Owning was recently purchased by Guaranteed Rate, and my experience with both companies was equally as bad. I do not recommend refinancing with Owning or Guaranteed Rate. One more note. . .They do not do self employed even if they tell you they do.< /review>

<Review>The people at Owning were professional, courteous and incredibly helpful. They made a potentially stressful process easy and clear. everything went smoothly and any delays were clearly explained. This was the best process and customer service I have ever experienced. Especially in the financial area.

I highly recommend them.< /Review><name>Rich Rivera</name>< date>

I was very pleased with the assistance we received during our recent refinancing with Owning. A friend told me she had contacted Owning, her quoted rate and gave me Jimmy’s phone number. Within a few day he said our loan was locked in, I was amazed. Lee, our loan processor, was helpful and patiently guided us through all the levels of necessary paperwork and documents. I called friends and family and told them of our experience and satisfaction with Owning Mortgage.<//review>

<text>To begin, I just want to thanks Erika S & Andrea C to help us to refinance our house loan. It was a fast and easy process that took a total of 2-3 weeks. It was really amazing.

I was recommended to Owning.com from a friend. I read quite a bit of reviews before actually emailing (I never heard about Owning.com). After I submit the online form, I was contacted within 3-4 hours. Then, documents start being submitted to Owning.com. Like I says before, 2-3 weeks is all it took for my loan to be refinanced.

I highly recommend this to anybody since their service is fast and friendly.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</gmap_id></record>

Working with Scott Luebcke was an absolute pleasure. From the start of the Application process to explaining cost, rates, third party fees, and how they are practically nonexistent, and helping us with the underwriting department, making sure we provided all necessary information and documentation. Then giving us a very smooth hand off to the very lovely Kim Truong, Who processed our loan in a very fast and efficient manner, while keeping an open line of communication at all times,  she was awesome! we were absolutely 100% blown away with the service standard you both set in the mortgage industry!
You both made the whole process so easy and completely painless that we would never have the need to ever shop for another mortgage company again. Thank you both so much for your time, and all your attention to detail.

The experience from beginning to end was easy, professional and extremely quick.  I could always count on getting my calls and emails answered the same day.  They did everything they said they would and completed my  refinance quickly.  I’ve referred friends and family to them and wouldn’t hesitate contacting Daniel at Owning for financing needs.< /review>

I’m overwhelmed by the level of excellence! Trevor provided us with a low rate refinance that went so smoothly. The rate that was quoted was the rate we received. His processor Christine also provided the same highest level of customer service. Owning Mortgage has qualified employees who respond fast with accurate information. I didn’t know such a clean streamlined mortgage could exist. We couldn’t be happier! I would highly recommend using Owning Mortgage.< /Text>

<text>Refinanced with Owning Corporation is easy and cost effective.  It has no money out of pocket with great APR for 30 years, 20 years and 15 years term.  I asked about the APR through its website.  About 30 minutes later,  a loan agent called and got the paper work started. The loan agents, Henry and Tricia, were very helpful.  They responded immediately when I had questions or issues with uploading documents.  Thank you Owing.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Rates were so low that I knew I had to refi. I was working with another company but it had been almost 4 weeks since I first started the process and it didn't seem any progress was being made. I provided the company with all the docs they needed on the very first day, yet 4 weeks later nothing had moved. They had locked in my rate but the expiration date was fast approaching and I was afraid I would lose out the low interest rates. My sister referred me to Owning. I contacted Owning and Phoebe Tran assisted me and I provided her all the docs immediately- she walked me through the steps.  As promised within a day Gary Do reached out to me and walked me through all the rest of the information. In less than a week the process was complete and we were just waiting for escrow to close. On the day my loan was closing with Owning the other company reached out to go over the next step with me. I happily told them Owning managed to accomplish in 1 week what they could not do in almost a month and I asked them to close my file. Escrow with Owning closed without any incidents and Gary was there to answer all the questions I had. I am very happy I chose Owning. I only wish I had gone to them first! Thank you Phoebe Tran and Gary Do for all your help. I am now enjoying my low rate and lower monthly payment.< /Review>

< review>
First contact with Loan agent, Lana was amazing.  quick and got me going.  None of that extra junk/questions.  Loan processor, Kathy, was similarly amazing.  replied to emails and questions quickly.  Only reason this is not a 5 star review was because funding the loan after papers where signed took way too long.  Got a call from Kathy that the company was doing some name or ownership change and a bunch of loans got caught in this transition.  I was patient, but worried that this was going to be a scam or my rates would change.  Finally closed after a few weeks.  A friend I recommended is still waiting for his to fund and he signed with title company before I did.  I don't think his loan processor was as good as Kathy.  He got a message to pay Feb mortgage and she will be back in 3 weeks!??  Hopefully after this transition or name change things will get processed faster.  But overall I still had a good experience and ended up with an amazing rate.<//review>

Did a Cash-out Refinance with Owning and it was the easiest loan experience I have every done. I chose Owning because it posted the best rates and terms. I even asked another place I had used before to match or beat their price and they could not. Everything went very smooth and I had no issues within the process. The entire process was very quick! I would recommend Owning to anyone looking for great rates and service.<//Review>

<Text>Super fast refinance! 15 days to complete everything. One of the best rates out there.

They do sell the servicing to other companies, which is fine as those companies accept online payments too. They may tell you that big banks like Chase would service your loan, which I have never seen with any of my friends using owning - so be mentally prepared.< /Text>< resp>

My experience with Owning was great.
The loan agent and processor helped walk me through the process to refinance my loan.
My loan agent took the time to explain several different option for my loan. Each option was laid out in an easy to understand format which allowed me to make an informed decision.
My loan agent was very professional as well. She called or email me for information that was needed to close my loan in a time frame that was faster than I am normally used to.
I highly recommend Owning Corporation for your next refinance.< /text>

I did have all my paper work ready and that help, but Jeremiah kept me informed of the process every step until the loan closed.

What a great way to refinance a mortgage!  After seeing rates drop to historic levels, I had to refinance.  All of my previous ones required a ton of paperwork and lots of handwritten signatures.  This was one of the easiest refinances I've ever done. The process is quick, easy and efficient.  As long as you have the routine documents to provide, the rest is easy.  I especially liked the docusign format where I can electronically sign the forms.  Everything was already filled out for me and I just reviewed and pushed a button.  Nothing to fax or mail in.  It was so easy.  The rates were as competitive as anywhere.  If you like fast and easy service, this is the place to go for your next refinance needs.  Five star for sure.< /Text>

<review>Hell All,
From the time when I first applied for my refinance loan with Kevin, through the Closing period with Shannon, it has been an amazing experience. I was surprised at the speed the whole process was moving.

After waiting for months with another Lender, and not going anywhere, I found Owning through a family friend, and my luck changed so much for the better; the rate was much better, the cost was negligible in comparison with other major lenders. After receiving the Goodbye Letter, I could not thank Owning enough.

Later, when there was an issue with the Lender the loan was transferred, it was Reina who came to the rescue, and all was good.
Thank you Owning for a very pleasant experience.

I contacted Owning back in Dec to refinance my home. we agreed in the conditions of the loan which was very competitive based on my 800 credit score. I was pitched that we would close in 3 weeks and that based on my documentation it would be a breeze. The time came and they begun scrambling with the processing department and had no time to close the deal. Jan came and they were still in the process and suddenly they called me that I had to re- apply because Owning was being  bought out by another company "Guaranteed Rate"  and they had different policies .  Now after 2 months,  March they said that I had to provide again all documentation and that I had to get re-approved. I re applied and submitted all documentation again because they said they would respect my initial approval. Here again they starting scrambling with the process blaming COVID. I waited for their call and nothing. I decided to try my luck with Quicken. They quickly took my info.. approved me and funded me before I got the next call from Guaranteed Rate... asking me for more documentation... I wouldnt waste my time with them. Quicken has their stuff together , got the loan done as promised in 3 weeks.< /text>

Jeff and team at Owning are awesome!!! As a shopper with great credit I was worried about obtaining the best advertised rates, but Jeff went above and beyond to get me the best rate advertised on their website. Lots of variables that can drive a rate up, but if you can meet their perimeters, they’ll come through.
Process was very easy and fast. I was able to do everything online (accept sign final loan docs).
In past I did all my loans through cash call, this time it was Owning with the best rates. I highly recommend them!!!<//review>

< review>
Bottom Line up Front: Owning provided a lower cost loan, at a lower rate, in less than 1/3rd the time Rocket did.

Full Review:

Simply amazed! This captures my reaction at closing, which occurred in just a couple weeks after initial contact. I have been a loyal Rocket Mortgage (3x) customer for too long, and was in week 6 of a refinance with Rocket when I reached out to owning. I had reached a point of frustration in the Rocket Process and my spouse stumbled upon Owning so I conducted some research and gave them a call.

Rocket Frustration:

The frustration with Rocket centered a “hard sale” approach the loan officer had taken combined with the processor communicating vaguely via their application.  The loan officer would dance around loan-origination fees (points) and would always reply with an “I’m doing the best I can with Credits”, whenever lender fees were discussed. Her responses consistently lacked clarity and substance.

Owning Experience the Opposite of Rocket:

Owning was 100% transparent in both lender and origination fees. Providing specific answers to justify anywhere from a .25% to 1% point increase. Whereas, Rocket would simply state “These fees are within Fannie Mae Freddie Mac guidelines”.  Total closing costs Lender + Origination Fees were 3k less with Owning and there were $0.00 in lender fees.

Owning offered rates that were true to the market whereas Rocket was slightly higher. In my situation, as each refinance/finance is unique, I received a rate from Owning that was a full 1% lower.

Owning was able to close the loan to include escrow funding in less than 3 weeks.

Owning leveraged both technology and old-fashion conversation when needed to work through the finer points of the loan and ensure all expectations were achieved[PW1] . Both Brian and Julie were awesome and a pleasure to work with.

In summary, losing my $500 deposit to Rocket was money well spent.< /review>

Thank you Owning for helping me with my refinance. I had a great experience. I was in the refinancing process with another lender and after two months with them I grew frustrated with the delay. A friend referred me to Owning. They got me a better rate, no loan fees, and no closing costs. It was a great deal and we were done start to finish in 3 weeks. I could not believe my luck finding Owning. They are the real deal!<//review>

This was the fastest refinance I ever experience in 2020 when mortgage companies are at their busiest in history.  Every one there was kind, awesome, quick to respond, knowledgeable.  Mei Tang my loan officer is very experience and will get the job done and make the process very smooth.  Cindy Liu, the processor is processor of the century.  Never had a processor that is so responsive ever.  You will never get a better processor than her.  This company also have great rates with low cost too.  A lot of other companies will over charge you.  You have to go with this company.  You wont regret it.  100% go with this company.  100% you will love it.  Thank you to everyone at Owning.</Review>

<Review>Though I have a grudge, overall I am satisfied with the service provided by Owning while refinancing my loan.
Here are the good
1. Very competitive rates
2. The loan processing was quick, smooth and very professional

Not so good
I was promised zero fees (including absolutely zero hidden fees). However, by the time the loan closed, I noticed certain fees charged by my current lender and because I was promised zero fees, I was hoping Owning Corp can live up to the word and cover for those fees too - which unfortunately did not happen.<//Review>< user_name>

I was looking to refinance my home to a lower rate I requested that someone get back to me regarding some questions & Brian Ngo emailed me immediately regarding my questions & by the next day I was on my way it took from start to finish 11 days.

I was referred to Owning by my best friend. She was raving about how easy and quick her refinance was and so I had to do my research. I went online and showed interest and was called very promptly by an agent. He was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to my questions about refinancing. I knew that rates were at an all time low and I wanted to find a company that could get me a great rate and make it a painless process. Derek and his team at Owning did just that! Even with Covid and all that comes with that, they did a flawless job at answering all my questions and keeping the ball rolling with our refi. We are beyond pleased with this company and it's amazing team! I highly recommend their services!<//Text>

From my fist conversation with Tom, everything went smoothly.  He quoted me very competitive Jumbo rates and was willing to talk to me without the whole 'let me have all your information first' routine. This was the most painless loan process I have ever been through. Loan processor Casey was great, very nice and efficient.  The whole process was a little over a month from first call to signing papers. Very efficacious, meaning quickly efficient.
Thanks so much much to Owning, to Tom , and especially Casey for being so nice.<//review>

Owning.com was great to deal with.  Very attentive and helpful.  They got our refi done and funded in just over 4 weeks.  Had I gone through my bank it would have taken about 75 days (bank's estimate, not mine).  So happy with Owning that I'm now refi'ing my investment property with them.</text>

Today is 04/15/21. I shared all my details on 12/03/20. I even signed my closing papers and then after dead silence came to know that there was a merger with another company. My loan is now with the new underwriter. I lost the opportunity to re-finance at historic low rates due to incompetence, lack of ownership and commitment from Owning Corporation. If you are getting a loan don't do the mistake of not having a backup plan.< /text>

You have plenty of options with other reputable lenders. Choose one of them before Owning.
We closed and signed our paperwork and had passed our three day right of resention and Owning never processed our loan (which is illegal). They never called to tell us they were selling assets to another company. They never called and said anything. We just assumed our loan closed until we noticed our current mortgage never got paid.
I strongly encourage you to choose a different lender.</review>

<text>Highly recommended for mortgage needs. Was done very quickly, and received one of the bests costs and rates I could find or have experienced. Every question I had was quickly answered, and entire process felt secure. Most of the work was done through email after a quick initial call, which made it easy to do in parallel to life’s distractions. Would definitely use them again for future mortgage needs!</text><rate>5<//rate><time>1607459668203< /time>< Pics>

Great lender! Worked with Mei Tang and got me an unbelievable deal for a refi that blew everyone out of the water. She was easy to work with and willing to take her time to explain every detail. Despite the crazy amount of refis going on during the end of 2020, Owning was able to finish my loan quickly. 100% would recommend.< /review>

<Review>I've refinanced twice with Owning within past 6 months and each time was a pleasant experience!  Not only Owning provides fast and speedy services, it also provides accurate and easy to understand information.  Each time, I didn't have any issues understanding the good faith estimate or loan disclosure statement provided.  What you hear is what you get!  The loan agents and processor are responses and pleasant to work with.  I would recommend Owning for mortgage service needs.< /Review></record>

NEVER, have I had a refinance done in 8 days.  From the day we first called, to the day we signed docs,,,, 8 days.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  We also got a 1.75% interest rate, and our appraisal was waived.  I had never heard of them before, but they are my new favorite company.  I am simply amazed.

My loan officer made the refinancing process as easy as it could possibly be. I may have spent a combined one hour on everything (including 2 delays caused by me trying to furnish the information needed). And the rates were great, I have confidence that I can easily pay off this home in less time. I genuinely recommend Owning!!<//Review>

I recently refinanced with the Owning corporation. I was hesitant at first since I had not heard of them before a radio commercial, but from the very first call with Timothy McLaughlin, I felt assured that this was the right choice. The rates were among the most competitive in the business (2.125% for 15yrs), they were easy to work with, and they were very quick (around 20 days). I also want to commend our amazing, responsive, and efficient loan processor, Elizabeth Esparza.  All-in-all, a great experience. I would highly recommend Owning for your mortgage needs.

<review>I looked into Owning Corporation after hearing about them through word of mouth. I was reasonably skeptical about online lenders at first since I have mainly dealt with large banks such as Chase and BofA. So naturally I had to do more research to put my mind at ease and kept them in check throughout the whole refinancing process. At the end, I was generally happy with my decision to go with them. Here are some of my feedback:
- Loan processing time is pretty fast, compared to big name banks. I sensed that they found a way to streamline the entire process very efficiently. In contrast, I often experienced delays and received redundant requests when dealing with larger banks despite my having all required and verifiable documents.
- John and Kent have been great at following up with my package. John was good at explaining things and Kent was brief and to the point, which I liked. Kent may sound bossy and a bit rude at times but I didn't mind as he was just doing his job.
- I closed with them back in December 2020 but waited until now to give them my feedback because I knew going in that Owning will immediately sell my mortgage to a third party and thus I wanted to capture the entire experience. My mortgage was transferred to Mr. Cooper and I have been generally pleased with them so far.
- I almost stopped my application during the process because Owning was no longer offering competitive rates after initial lockup period on my higher rate has expired. John was ultimately able to offer the lower rate only after I submitted offers from other lenders. It is very important to do your own research in order to get the best rate as possible.
- I am leaving my feedback here at the request of their marketing department. However I'm happy to do so as I am pleased with the overall outcome. Kudos to Angela for not forgetting to send me a reminder. Great doing business with you.</review><Name>brandon lee<//Name><Resp>{'time': 1613681157219, 'text': 'Thanks for the thorough review Brandon, we appreciate you taking the time!'}<//Resp></record>

Nina, the underwriter was super friendly and guided me through the process and delays due to unforeseen circumstances. I loved working with them and will continue to approach you folks in the future.< /Review>< rate>

<review>Derek Martin and Annie Lac did an exceptional job with my refi.  Derek did a great job answering all my questions, and made loan application process simple. Annie was able to get loan processed extremely fast.  Loan was funded within 15 days from application.  Great job!</review>< user>

My refinance process was extremely quick and easy. I got a great rate and my agent took care of everything. The disclosures were handled online. And the agent even did all the work for closing an existing line of credit. I did not need an appraisal so the entire process from application to closing took about two weeks. Owning kept all their promises and I was extremely pleased with the process.< /Text>

<Review>I have refinanced my home 3 times in the last five years and this was the best experience yet. It literally took 2 weeks from the first phone call to funding.  Mei and Linda was great to work with and answered every call I made. Even the final signing was quick..would absolutely recommend Owning for anyone who would like to refinance.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1606769454914, 'text': 'Thank you for the review, we strive to make the refi experience faster than easier than ever!'}</response><gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been calling them for over 3 weeks and the "receptionist" keeps telling me there are no agents available at the moment.  that was 3 weeks ago and every few days since.  I have no idea what they're doing over there but I can guess it's most likely absolutely nothing.  redirecting calls and getting a paycheck.  I would recommend ANY other company tbh</review>

The Refinance process with Owning is as simple as ABC.. The Loan Consultants and Processor were very helpful throughout the entire process. Best of all the turn around time is unheard of.. I closed within 3 weeks and that's from start to finish.. If I could, I would give them 10 stars.. Best mortgage company out there.</Text>

<Text>When I was referred to Owning, it was a blessing in disguise.Unlike other refinance companies which try to hurry you into signing with them, Owning is different.My loan agent John Nguyen and loan processor Kim Tran were exceptional!
Throughout the process they were professional and thorough. They were available when I called with questions, and promptly followed up with me with any missed calls. I liked this easy approach and transparency. Last but not the least their rates are awesome!I applaud them for the wholesome package of great rate, pace, exceptional service!
Thank you Owning for everything you do. Keep up the good work!</Text><Name>Sm K<//Name><userid>115674026830730027277<//userid>< Pictures>

Our originator and loan processor were both very knowledgeable and professional. I’m really amazed Owning can close a refinance in 15 days.  We are very happy with our “forever refi”. The low rate is unbelievable.  I highly recommend Owning Corporation for your refinance.< /text>

Avoid working with Tina Do and Julio Ramirez. If you are already working with them, be sure to check everything they give you very carefully. They promised me 80% LTV on a refinance and after four months of dragging their feet finally gave me the “clear to close” however I discovered on the Closing Disclosure document they switched LTV to 75% requiring me to bring $10s of thousands of dollars to closing. Completely different than the loan estimates they gave me up to that point. After a week of them “asking for approval” to change to 80% LTV
I had to walk away from the deal. How could they possibly give me a rate lock and loan estimate without the authority to do the deal at the terms they promised? Terrible communication and terrible customer service. Avoid like the plague.<//Text>

I just completed a refinance with Owning and worked directly with Tiffany Ramirez.  It was refreshing to work with Tiffany.  She processed my loan quickly and efficiently.  She ALWAYS replied to my emails immediately and I didn’t notice any mistakes in the paperwork.  This has not been the case in the past with other loan providers or loan processors.

My experience with Owning and Tiffany has left a very good impression and I will definitely refer family and friends if they are interested in refinancing their home loans.< /Text>

We look forward to your feedback, thank you!"}< /Response><user_name>Nathan Turner</user_name><Review>The process was speedy and as easy as I've experienced.  Owning is essentially a service that coordinates lots of independent contractors, like realtors, title companies, notaries, etc, to process loans with a cheaper overhead.  They do well at making sure you're not going to overpay as far as I can tell (I'm no mortgage refinancing expert).  That being said, the customer service leaves something to be desired.

During the process, it felt more like Owning and its contractors were the customer and we were there to serve them.  We were happy that they were quick to respond, but at times they were a bit pushy.  Texts at 9pm.  The notary almost seemed to be irritated that they had to come to us.  And the reason I'm posting this review is a near-daily "polite reminder" via email and text to write a review.  Like I mentioned, the relationship seems to be turned around; Owning seems to view the customer as someone who is there for Owning.

Update, 11-24-2020
Even after Owning posted a response to my review below, their questionable customer service has continued.  I received a notice for instructions on the first payment, only 4 business days before it is due, and the only option being for a physical mailed check.  I'm mailing it directly from my bank but the check isn't projected to arrive until the day after it's due.</Review></record>

This was the second refinance that we completed with Owning.com in 2 years.  Each time the loan consultants were sharp, creative and hard working (Jason Lyon in 2019 and Brandon Rodriguez in 2020), and the loan processor Cindy Dang could not have been more pleasant and professional.  In both refinancing events, Owning.com closed the loan in just 2 weeks and everything except the notarization was electronic!  Outstanding!</review>

Our neighbors recommended Owning when we wanted to refinance. They had a wonderful experience and thought that we would as well. We are so happy that we listened to them! Nick Ramirez, our loan officer, was proficient, polite and made the application process very easy. Niema Young, our processor, was simply fantastic! We could not have asked for a better team. We would be confident recommending Owning to anyone.< /text>

Very professional staff. Friendly and helpful. Great guidance.
It really only took 3 weeks from re-fi application to closing.
While everything as above went well, and I knew of a possibility of
my loan being sold, I am not happy that I found out today that my loan is being sold to what I thought was a person. The purchaser of my Mortgage is called Mr. Cooper.  Not another financial institution, bank or corporation. This is a Mortgage company who changed their name. Personally why would a Mortgage company take Mortgage out of their name. Not sure If by first impression this company will give me confidence.< /review>

I’ve done 4 Refi’s in 2020. Two with Owning. Alex and Edgar by far the most responsive and proactive. This is rare nowadays. Owning would be crazy to let these guys go. Also Owning had best rates and cheapest. It wasn’t even close. President of company should be proud. I’m sure they are making money but more importantly they are providing the best customer service and good value. I sound like a spokesperson or family member of the company. Nope. I only do twos types of reviews cause my time is valuable. If it’s over the top awesome or really horrible. Owning is over the top awesome.< /review>

I spoke with Derek and he was very patient with answering all the questions I had for him. He was able to get a really good rate for me. Amanda assisted with the escrow process and she was super helpful and efficient in getting my re-financing completed. When it was time for the notary, someone had come to my house so I didn’t have to step out. Everyone had safe practices and was friendly. From start to finish it took about 3 weeks, that’s really fast considering this pandemic. Thank you!</text>

I applied for a refinancing loan. Mr George Garcia took my application over the phone, and Mr Klinton Thomas was the processor for the loan. Both  George and Klinton made the process extremely easy and simple. They are both true professionals who bring honor to their respective profession and the company who they work for. I could not have asked for a more pleasant experience for a refinance process. Speed and accuracy were second to none! From start to finish, it only took two weeks. If it was possible I would give them 10 stars!<//review>

Outstanding experience working with the folks out at Owning.com. So far my husband and I have gone through 5 mortgages/refinances and so far Owning has been hands down the best to work with. A special shout out to Anthony Morgan and Anthony DiGiorno who made our life so easy getting through the refinance process. They got us a great deal and made the whole process efficient and we were done with the refinance in no time. I would highly recommend Owning.com - don't bother even going to the other companies. Thanks again!</Review>

< review>
The process was really quick - spoke with a loan officer one evening, signed some papers and sent over documentation and signed closing papers within 2 weeks. I compared offers between several other companies and although there was one that was technically better (same interest rate, but more lender credits), I ended up going with Owning because of their promise to close quickly. They were able to waive the appraisal and sent a notary out shortly after, and the load was funded a couple of weeks after that (which was longer than they had expected, but at that point there wasn't much anyone could do). I would have liked my loan processor to be more proactive about updating me about the loan funding timeline, but she did answer all my questions in a timely manner. I did get some surprise fees at the end even though the loan estimate said I would only pay prepaid interest, but it was a only few hundred dollars and ultimately, refinancing is saving me a ton of money as my mortgage rate is now almost cut in half. If you meet the requirements to go with Owning, I would recommend them.< /review>

I want to especially thank “Samantha” at Owning for going above and beyond to help me solve a problem that was unrelated to Owning — just the best service one could ask for in a mortgage lender. Highly recommend!<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</gmap_id>< pictures>

My loan officer, Melanie, made all the difference! Mine was quick and easy. Everyone’s individual situation is different but mine was a 0 cost loan with no appraisal and escrow closed in about 1 week with loan funded shortly thereafter. I now have a much lower payment and don’t have to worry about making payments for the next 2 months! Super happy!< /Review>

I was in the process with another company who took almost two months to finally tell me they couldn’t give me the current lower rate.  A coworker gave me contact info on his guy Jeff Porter from owning.  I spoke to Jeff about my long process and he got me a lower rate within minutes.  He and my processor Tammy were always available for questions and closed my loan quick. Thanks Jeff and Tammy!! Wish I contacted you a lot sooner!</review>

<gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402<//gmap_id><Review>This is the third time I have refinanced my mortgage with Owning and every experience has been very positive and I was able to lower my rate with no fees.

Once I realized the rates were down substantially this year, I called Owning and spoke with Ron Radziminsky so I could make the best choice for my particular need which was a cash out plus a full 1 point lower than what I had with no fees.  Needless to say, Owning was by far the best deal without having to pay points to get the best deal.  I did call around to other mortgage companies just to see if any one of them could match what Ron was offering and not one company could match the offer.

Ron was professional and very responsive any time I contacted him about any questions or clarifications about the documentation that was needed to expedite the loan.  Trusting the person you are working with is instrumental when refinancing a home mortgage, and given my positive history with Owning, I felt like I would be given accurate answers without any worry.  I was not disappointed!

My loan processor, Edgar Moreno, was terrific and responded to all of my questions about uploading multiple documents and the format needed to satisfy the approvals.  I must say that this refi was the easiest and fastest ever.  The notary Owning sent was also exceptional and knowledgeable and made the final step very fast and safe (signing on my patio with masks).

It would be hard to beat the service and professionalism of Owning!!</Review><user_name>victoria chamberlin<//user_name><time>1609912108053< /time>< Response>

I did!  In fact, I referred a friend to Owning, but unfortunately, she (and I) learned that you only work with CA property owners.  If you have an affiliate in FL, please let me know.

2.            Did you have an overall good and positive experience with your Owning Loan Processor?

I sure did!  She was wonderful!  She responded promptly and even after hours/ on weekend which I did not expect at all.  She was very professional personable.

3.            Was the overall process completed to your level of satisfaction?

The portion of the process that wasn't communicated well was the length of time it would be delayed by Escrow.  I had to call and get a supervisor involved in order to get it completed which caused several additional days of me accruing higher interest with my former lender.  It would have been helpful to know up front that the Escrow was going to drag on for a couple of WEEKS.  The rest of the process was incredibly fast, so I thought that something was wrong when escrow took so long.

4.            If you were to rate your experience on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being a superior experience, which number would you assign your overall experience with Owning?      5 to Owning and a 2 to escrow.<//Text>< pictures>

I'd like to clarify my experience with Owning was during a time when rates are at all time lows and they very clearly as all other firms were extremely busy. Owning reached out to me almost immediately upon my inquiry to refinance. I received an amazing rate (stupid low), they followed up and responded promptly. From the day of my application, we signed documents maybe a week after, that is super fast. What took a little longer was the funding or electronic wiring of funds to my current loan holder, that took around 2 weeks. No complaints here as they gave me a heads up that funding was a tad behind. Overall it took about 3 weeks from beginning to end, which again in these times was amazing. Very happy with the overall experience, thank you to Roland N. and Joseph R. !</review>

Refinancing is never easy. There is enough paperwork to fill a goodly section of the Library of Congress.
However, Owning corp made it easier with a lot of online "paperwork." It was remarkably fast and as much easier than I had ever encountered before. In my experience (and I'm a card-carrying senior citizen with a lot of experience) a mistake or two is always made. This time there was one and it was caught a corrected immediately. The mark of a great company is not how well they handle a perfect situation, but how they handle a mistake. They did great.
In short: They were fast, efficient, professional, reasonable and dedicated to our satisfaction. Hence: five stars.< /text>

It was a great journey starting from Kevin's call to signing the final papers.

Kevin - You went out of his way to give me the rate which I wanted and on top of it cashback as a bonus. He helped me get the best out of it as of the current scenario. Responded to all the doubts/questions wherever it is needed.

Alyssa - You kept me posted on all the steps from underwriting to closing. Communication was crystal clear and the response was super fast for any corrections.

I did refinance a couple of times, but this THE FASTEST in my history. YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB.

I would definitely refer you guys to friends and family.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Quick and hassle free refinance. Straight forward in what they can offer and very transparent. Clearly amazing rates compared to many other lenders with whom I have maintained a long term relationship! Agent assigned to me was very quick and every query got answered within minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.< /review>

Very happy with my experience with Owning. Wesley was always available and aggressive with the terms of my 30 year refinance. Was able to match with some of the lowest rates out there. Working with Patrick as my processor was also a pleasure. He was extremely responsive and responded to emails even late into the evening. There was a delay of about a week between the actual closing date and the funding of the loan, but otherwise very pleased. First contact 9/16. Loan funded 10/13.< /review>

<Text>Very efficient & good service provide by Karen & Michael from Team Owning in refinancing. Karen was up front & stated she will only work full files with the December fee increase. Once received & verified, she provide 2 loan options and it was worth to proceed. Worked with Michael and he was another helpful professional during the process. Our excellent credit scores made it easier, if Owning had clients like us, they be banking the cash-money, LOL!!!! Hey it's a 2 way street when it comes to the mortgage game!!!!!

The process was pretty quick and straightforward.  The best part, is their transparency.  Unlike other companies, you can find out their current interest rates by going to their website.

<Review>I recently refinanced my home with Owning Corporation.  They were referred to me by my financial advisor who had clients who were very satisfied with Owning.  Let me tell you, my experience was also fabulous!  My Loan Originator Hugo Viruete got me off to a prompt and efficient start, and Roland Ng was an an absolutely outstanding Loan Processor!  Roland moved my refinance through the system quickly.  He was professional, helpful, and a great communicator.  I always knew where we were in the process and if I needed to act, he would reach out to keep things moving.  Roland was available any time I reached out, even well after normal business hours.  No time was wasted!  My rate was awesome, cost was low, and the whole process was completed in under three weeks.  Unbelievable really!  I've worked with other loan companies and have generally been satisfied, but Owning has set a new standard for me!  Thanks Owning, it was my pleasure to work with you!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I was taken good care of. Replies were fast and the process was easier than I expected. Refinancing a home isn’t exactly what we would choose for a fun family activity, but Kevin and Alyssa from owning did a great job to get my deal done quickly. I’m glad my cousin referred me to them the direct contact made it simple. When people ask me who to use I’ll gladly tell them Owning.</Review>< Response>

<review>Owning did an amazing job of closing our loan in 3 weeks.  The service was incredible - everyone we dealt with was honest and knowledgeable and respectful of our time.  They were also incredibly responsive, even when they were dealing with the fires in California.  You don't often see this level of customer service.  They were a pleasure to deal with and everything went exactly as they had promised.  If we need another loan, we will go directly to Owning.<//review>< gmapID>

<Review>My wife and I were looking for a home for the past year. In July 2020, we found our dream home. At the time we did not have a listing agent and remembered that we saw Owning.com billboard on our way back to San Diego from LA.  The following morning I made a call to owning.com which turned out to be best call I have ever made. The representative I spoke with on the phone advised that a real estate agent will contact me soon. Shortly after that Jenna called me who is   very professional and knowledgeable. Soon thereafter we made an appointment and had our first viewing of this magnificent house. We knew right away this was the one.

Jenna guided us through the process first by placing a offer on our dream home. She was very helpful and knowledgeable in preparing all the documents and since we are first time buyers, she took the extra step to explain every little details in the contract. Her advises helped us through the purchasing process.  By the middle of our escrow period, Jenna had become our point of contact for the simplest questions and she never missed answering any of the questions we had. She certainly did not hesitate to reach out to us after hours via telephone if needed so that we can sleep peacefully in the middle of anxiety of the buying process. She helped with the owning rebate program and which helped us pay for the closing cost.

After looking back at the deal, the negotiations, home inspections, repair request list, helping communicate to lenders, getting us to closing on our dream home, we realized it would not be possible without her professionalism. At that moment, we deeply understood the importance of having a great agent and considered blessed to have Jenna Whitehead as our Realtor. If you want results I strongly recommend using Jenna Whitehead with owning.com.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

They gave me a quote that's very competitive compared to quotes I got from other lenders and it was no cost to me, no points, no lender fees, no closing costs, and no 3rd party costs. I could have gotten lower rate but this was truly no cost I went with this option.Their website is not fancy but effective. I just uploaded all the documents that they needed. It took a little over a month to close but no major issues along the way. My loan officer Eric and processor Peter were very prompt in responding to the questions.

<Review>The process was fast and streamlined. I believe it took about a month from start to end. I was reimbursed for closing costs, but my new loan is ~ $2500 higher then the principle left on the original one. Both owning and original lender point to each other for this. Thus 4 out of 5 stars. Overall I've got a good deal shredding 1% from the APR and happy about the process.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1604345391307, 'text': "Hi Alexey, if you'd like to delve deeper into the terms of your new loan please reach out to customersuccess@owning.com and they can help, but we're glad you could shave a full percentage point off your APR and are happy to have helped you!

Our overall experience is positive. We like the business model, simple and competitive. Document submission, approval process very smooth. Do read the fine prints to make sure that you meet all the requirements to get the advertised rates. Only issue was that the loan funding was delayed by 10 days, and no one notified us in any way. It eventually funded the loan fine. As a part of good service, it would be necessary to notify customer when important deviation from schedule occurs. If your loan qualifications meet the requirements, I do recommend this company.</Review>

Both our loan processes were slightly delayed in January due to Owning's merger with Guaranteed Rate. No worries... Owning's Team with Alexander Ali and loan processor Patrick helped us navigate through to closing.

As mergers go, transitioning is quite a challenge. With the pandemic and staff working remote, Owning's Team, especially their Payments Manager, the Director and the Manager of Customer Success, met this transition challenge with exemplary care. While we initially giggled at the name of this department, it is no joke. Their Customer Success Team strives for customer satisfaction and meets their objectives in extraordinary ways beyond expectations. I rarely write negative Reviews because I don't trust the ones I read, but I will write a good Review when well-deserved with details to back it up.< /Review>< Time>

UPDATE Feb. 23, 2021:
I contacted John Martinez (the manager who had contacted me) last week and I was handed off to another loan officer. They have been unable to give me pricing. I left another voicemail for Mr. Martinez today. I have been told by other lenders that rates went up last week. I could have been locked in before that happened if my case was being given the attention they assured me it would be given. So, I'm adjusting my rating back to 1 star as I'm losing hope that they'll be able to right the wrongs in my situation. Very disappointing!

UPDATE Jan 26, 2021:
I was called by 2 supervisors from Owning today and one has assured me they can make sure my loan is handled well when we’re eligible to refinance and the other is looking into how my original loan was handled. I am hopeful that my situation can be turned around. Adjusted to 3 stars as I await resolution.

Original Review Jan 26, 2021:
We were referred to Owning from a retired mortgage broker. We completed the process for a VA refinance (IRRRL) and explained that we had just got the original loan in June 2020. We have excellent credit, w-2 income and assets sufficient to qualify. We told the loan officer (Leonard Sanchez) that we couldn’t fund before meeting the VA requirements. Rather than telling us Owning’s requirements or the VA requirements, the loan officer passed our loan on to an administrator who pushed it through the process. In the final stage, we were denied because we haven’t had our loan for a year. I don’t know of any loan that has a 1 year requirement. The VA has guidelines, but not a year. After we were denied, no one at Owning would return our call. We still don’t know what the 1 year waiting period for a refinance is all about as we have never heard of that. It was a terrible customer service experience.<//review>

I have gotten a few Refi's over the years. My loan with Owning Corp was by far the best customer experience I have ever had. Their representatives and processors were very knowledgeable and helpful. Quickest and easiest loan processing I've ever had. Everything is processed online except for the final loan docs which are processed by a mobile notary at your home. I highly recommend Owning.< /text>

Owning was the smoothest and fastest refinance process we have ever done!!  Everything from e-signing disclosures to submitting the required documents was extremely easy using their document platform.  Asia and his team kept us updated along the entire process and they were even able to match a lower interest rate from another lender with ZERO fees!!  I’d highly recommend Owning if you’re looking to refinance!  Thanks Owning for the superior experience and interest rate!!<//text>

My wife and I recently bought a home in Long Beach with a 30-year loan @ 3.625% interest rate. We found a another loan company that offered a loan rate of 2.75%. My bank of 20 years and credit union of 40 years could not do better. I saw an add on TV for Owning Corporation with a possible loan rate at 1.75%. I contacted Owning and found them very credible (including a BBB check), easy to work with, and very responsive to my inquiries. We have now closed with Owning at the1.75% interest rate for a 15-year loan. They are saving us over $40,000 from the re-finance loan we previously were pursuing.</Text>

Very refreshing zero worries about not possibly receiving the absolute best interest rate. Agent was straight forward and didn't mind we shopped and compared the rates. Trung Ha was knowledgeable and confident and covered all ins and outs while his partner Cindy got the ball rolling and closed the refinance within days. Awesome team!!<//Text>

Owning was great !!!
Gave they me best rate possible and even the refinance process was quick and smooth.

Worked with Colleen Mai(Loan Processor) and Henri Nguyen(Loan Originator).

Also, liked the fact that everything was done online, and the notary came home to finish the paper work.< /review>

I recently used Owning for a refi and the experience was exceptional.  Despite Covid, they were able to handle my account quickly, professionally and friendly.  I worked with Brad Terschluse and he pushed through deadlines in order to lock in my rate and he also checked in with me throughout the entire process.  Jillia Sidfrid was in charge of all of the documentation processing and did an excellent job.  She was responsive and professional.  I would recommend Owning, Brad and Jillia without any reservation.  Great job!<//text>

Owning was an absolute dream to work with. I wish I could give them 10 stars. The agents were patient with me on the one hand, while working incredibly quickly on the other hand to get the loan closed three times faster than I ever thought possible. Their process is professional, streamlined, and much easier than any other refi I’ve ever done (and I have done several).

Owning is a fantastic company. I highly recommend them to anyone who needs a mortgage or a refi.<//text>

I had a great experience with Owning as the lender on my refi.  The loan agent was very near perfect and so was the customer service agent that pushed my loan over the mile to funding.  They missed the 2 week funding date by a week, but considering how long other lender take (2 months), they still did an awesome job.  I would recommend them to anyone. No games or tricks with the rate and fees, they gave me exactly what they promised me. I am a very satisfies customer.<//text>

It is my pleasure to write about my experience with Owing Corporation.
I have had a most rewarding experience working with my loan officer, Dat Huynh.  He made everything so easy.  He was personable, knowledgeable and professional.   After he finished getting my information together, I worked with Joshua Esguerra who equally was very helpful, responsive and knowledgeable.  Easy peasy!  The loan rate was excellent!   On a scale of 1-5, I give Owning a 10!  My sister also refinanced with Dat and she echoes my sentiments!<//text>

I had a fantastic experience with Owning.com. The agent that facilitated my loan, Alex Virkh, was great to work with and he made the process seamless. He was quick to respond and very knowledgeable. After Alex I was passed to the loan processor, Bobby Lee, who was also a pleasure to work with and very communicative with our deadlines. Overall I cant believe how easy it was! I would absolutely recommend Owning to anyone in the market for a home loan or refinance.</Text>

I have refinanced my townhome a few times. I think Owning was far most the best service. I think that has mainly to do with Henri Nguyen and Julie Kim. They were both very patient and listened to my questions. Great place to refinance your home.< /Text>

Owning was fantastic. Best rate, best service. Refinanced start to finish in two weeks.  Would have been sooner if the notaries weren't so busy! Next time I buy or refinance, Owning has definitely earned my business.  Couldn't be happier with them.</Review>

< Review>
I received owning reference through my colleagues. They referred owning for best mortgage rate compared to competitors and shorted closing duration. With this, I started also started my town home refinance with them in last week of November, 2020. They were quick at each step and were able to close the refinance within 20 business days. It was easy to share the tax, paystubs, etc. confidential information with them through secure dropbox instead emails. Overall, Owning deserve 5 stars for their simple website to show the loan progress and managing quick closing at competitive interest rate.</Review>

Owning Corporation is an excellent source for your home mortgage.

When seeking a mortgage, you want a company that:
1-	Does what it says it will do;
2-	Commits to a time frame and keeps to those times; and
3-	Has an excellent product.

Owning also had excellent customer service.  Owning representatives return your calls, answer your questions, and keep you informed during the process.

You have to love a company that does all those things AND has the lowest APR on the market.<//text>

From the first day I contact Jacob, we closed our loan just 8 days later. In all the times I've bought or Refied the process has never been so seamless and easy. Thank you to Jacob and our processor Jerry J!  Because our experience was so fantastic, I referred two friends and they too were able to get the same great service and low rates from Jacob.

<review>Refinance process went smoothly. Closing was executed earlier than closing date but disbursement with title company was not as good. No information on the closing for 10 days after repeated follow ups determined it did not occur. It caused major concern as I had to pay current lender to make sure no credit impact.  Did not leave a good experience as the transaction seemed to be a failure. Paul from owning.com was great and able to engage with title company and engaged to address with title company.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have done many a re-finance in my life, but I have to say that working with Michael Roberts at Owning Corp. was by far the easiest, smoothest process I have ever experienced.  They are a class act and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a home loan or re-fi!< /Text>

Fast and efficient loan refinance process. Although, I felt the loan officer and loan processor were not as personable, they were readily available to answer all of my questions. (It was possible that they were very busy with many loans to process.) My loan was closed in less than two weeks and I got notification every steps of the way. I have recommended Owning Corporation to friends and family for loan refinance.</review>

I have refinanced a few times and never have I had such a smooth and easy process. I cannot believe how fast the transaction was it was literally two weeks the rate was the best that I found on the market.I’m not a person who normally leaves feedback but I thought it was important to share how good the service is that I received.

My experience with Owning was extremely positive! They quickly responded after I inquired about refinancing my house. I continued to receive quick responses throughout the process and always spoke to someone live. Other companies I inquired with communicated through email and were very slow to respond. The process took about four weeks and I received an amazing rate! I have already and will continue to recommend Owning!</Review>

I went with Owning for a refinance on my mortgage based off of a recommendation from a family member who is a CPA. They had very competitive rates and I was extremely satisfied with their effort making the whole process easy for me. Juliana was my main contact and Ricardo was my processor, both of whom did an amazing job getting my refinance through. All of my questions were answered in a timely fashion, which I appreciate.< /text>

Representatives were very professional, organized and attentive to our needs.  There were a few last minute items that the underwriters needed that would have been nice to know earlier. At the end of it all, however, we are very pleased with the experience.  We have already recommended Owning to many of our friends and family.  Hopefully they contact Owning for their refinancing needs.< /Review>

Very expeditious loan process.  I would use them again.  At the end of the loan, after signing docs and closing the deal to fund the loan...everything fell apart for 2 weeks.  My previous loan was not funded, the payment for the mortgage was due, and incurred a late fee.  Communication with the Owning agents was primarily through email ONLY.  In the end, everything worked out okay, but we had 2 weeks of stress and concern that wasn't being rectified.  Owning paid for the late fee as well.<//text>

I was referred to Owning by a coworker who had a great experience himself. I was contacted by Marc and was assured the process would be streamlined and efficient. And it was!!! My loan was handed over to Christina, who was patient and answered all my questions. She scheduled the signing of the documents and made sure everything went smoothly. I have and will continue to recommend Owning to my friends and family looking to refinance their home. Bottom line, they took care of me and gave me a great rate unlike my current finance company who was going to charge me over 18 thousands dollars to do what Owning did for so much less. Marc and Christina are definitely great assets to Owning and made my decision to do business with them and amazing experience!!!<//text>

Worked with Mike and Cindy, a few quick questions and Mike gave me a quote and shortly after I went ahead and started on my application. Excellent and timely communication from Cindy throughout the refinance process. The best and smoothest refinance I have ever experienced, from completing my application to signing the final documents it was under 2 weeks and the loan funding completed shortly after. Definitely a 5 star experience, would certainly work with Owning Corp again<//text>

<Text>I called and spoke to a guy (Ed Cook) that took my info quickly and effectively and then he said I would hear from a loan processor within a few days. And within one or 2 days i get an email from the processor (Monica graham) it was smart of me to have my dosc8ments as ready as possible to help the proceed along. The entire team was very involved and responsive was able to close in a matter of 3 weeks, and to boot, the day before the New Year.
I will absolutely recommend Owning to those seeing my post as well as people that may ask me. Best, Matt< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I was referred by a colleague who had been referred by two other people so I decided to contact Owning.  The mortgage refinancing process with Owning went really well and was a speedy process.  If I had questions I received answers quickly.  Overall it was a great experience!<//text>

Although I dreaded the process (due to past experiences at other banks) I decided to refinance our home. The process was amazingly efficient. I uploaded paystubs, W2s, and my mortgage statement. After that, I was advised that I would close the loan in 3 weeks or less. My loan processor answered my questions immediately and kept me updated on the status of the loan. I closed the loan in exactly 3 weeks. I was so impressed that I referred 4 friends and family members who refinanced as well. I highly recommend Owning.</Text>< Pics>

Very professional and responsive.  My loan closed within 2.5 weeks start to finish.   One of the fastest turnarounds I've ever experienced. Also the best rates and no cost loan.   This is the second time I've refinanced this year and Owning had better rates and better responsive service from the other company I used.  I'm very impressed and happy with them.<//Review>

The customer service with Owning is exceptional! The agent SAMANTHA was patient, and willing to help, and walked with me through the whole process to take care of an issue not caused by them, but by another company, she was very professional, very knowledgeable and made sure everything was taken care of before ending our call, which was probably an hour or so, I recommend Owning for any Mortgage needs and SAMANTHA made this issue a pleasant one.</Review>

<Name>Chuck Peterson<//Name><time>1606200587655< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This is the 2nd experience at  re-financing with Owning Corporation.  The first was fairly rapid, taking approximately one month, with an appraisal on our property.  There were a few inquiries back to me for more information, which made the process take a little longer.  which now, brings me to the recent re-finance.  The Finance Officer Melanie, reached out to me by phone & email, quite a few times (probably being a previous client) which got my attention.  When I responded, I requested where I would like to be with a rate percentage.  Melanie quoted me, whereas I asked her if she could try to get a lower rate, to save more on our monthly payment.  Being Seniors & on a budget, she said she would see her manager to see what she could do. A day or so later, she was able to save us a larger amount, which would help us greatly, with our monthly budget and..... she got the appraisal waived.  The rest of the process was handled by Owning Processor, Ms. Heidi McGillicuddy.  Dealing with her was smooth & a very rapid experience & probably the fastest processing we have ever been through, since we've been in our home.  The rest of the conclusion of document signing, after only two weeks, took about 25 minutes!  the Notary was "Super-Fast!"  BEST Re-financing we ever had!  Recommend OWNING CORPORATION to anyone who wants a fair & usually fast conclusion to their particular situation.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>I encourage all homeowners to refinance their mortgage.  We just closed our mortgage refinance with Owning.  There were NO Surprises!  I was on guard, in the end, it was not necessary.  Every detail unfolded exactly as they said it would.

Do yourselves a favor, refinance and keep more of your money every month, instead of giving it to the bank!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1605926886946, 'text': 'Thanks Bob, glad we could help!'}<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</GmapID></record>

<review>Great rate.  I appreciate that they actually publish it without making you jump through hoops and I was able to get the advertised rate.  From initial contact to signing with the notary was super fast.  Things fell apart a bit after that.  Communication about loan funding, loan payoff, first payment, and transfer to a new servicer was frustrating.  Once the 3-day rescission period on the refinance ends, they have made their money and you are at their mercy.<//review>< name>

<review>I have refinanced my home in the past and this was the best experience ever! My first contact was with Justin Hoang who got the process started.  He was timely with all his communications and even answered the phone on a weekend evening when I just expected to leave a message.  Once my documents were submitted, I worked with loan processor Linda Nguyen.  She was just as great as Justin in all aspects, answered all my questions in a timely manner and processed the loan quickly.  Everything proceeded as promised.  We started the loan process on August 4 and signed the documents with the notary on August 17.  The loan was funded on August 24, so 20 days from start to finish.  BTW, our home is in a trust and they knew just what to do regarding the special paperwork needed to handle that properly.  It was a great experience and I have already recommended Owning.com to family members.  Thanks.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< username>

The efficiency with which I was able to get my refi done with Owning made my head spin -- I literally got a phone call before I had completed all the pages of the initial online inquiry. Both my loan agent (Mei) and loan processor (Nina) were very clear, thorough, and fast -- making sure to get us locked into a fantastic rate ahead of 12/1/20 to avoid the new refi tax, even after an important change to our circumstances that necessitated a fresh review and adjustment. And their online portal for document submission made everything extremely easy. FANTASTIC experience!<//Review>

I loved working with Jack Bati and his processor. We refinanced during COVID. Jack explained everything clearly. He was Johnny on the spot with calling back and making everything work smoothly. I am a realtor and have worked with many lenders and mortgage brokers over 33 years, and Jack was one of the most efficient that I have worked with and this was my personal refi, not for a client. I would refer Jack Bati anyday all day long. He got me a great rate with no appraisal and no closing costs. I have never had such an easy experience ever. It closed very quickly as well, I think within 20 days or so. I have heard nightmares during COVID where lenders are taking 3 months and more and the loans are not closing. But not with Jack Bati. Excellent all around.< /Text>

Owning.com is super easy to work with and I love that they cover the fees. Since this was my second refi with them, all I had to do was update my salary information, provide my recent statements and they did all the rest. I'm now saving a ton of money on my mortgage. If you need a great person, contact Darren O'Neil (darren.oneil@owning.com) to start the process. Plus, their loan processor, Rosie, was super responsive. I tried calling other companies to shop around and found fee after fee and that rates were not as low as what they advertised. Plus some of the people calling seemed super shady. With Owning, they are upfront, honest and hassle free.< /review>

<text>I completed two refinances with Owning. By far the quickest and easiest refinance I've ever done: less than two weeks to close and everything was super smooth. Their pricing beat all of the other quotes we got as well. Marc, Kelsey, and Alyssa were all very responsive and knowledgeable.

Only nitpick is that their documentation and signing platform is a pretty barebones. It works fine but if you want to refer to past docs you have to hunt around for the original email link. But if that's how they keep pricing low, I'll take it!< /text>< pics>

< review>
The loan application process was quick and easy. Rate was great. Closing wasn’t as smooth since we had to essentially make 2 mortgage payments for the month due to the timing of the funding. However, Owning did take care of the late payment penalty due to the late funding, once the funding was completed. Now we just need to wait for the prior mortgage company to refund us the double payment. An inconvenience but overall, the refi worked out for us.< /review>

<review>Our agent Chris T. is a complete professional. He is knowledgeable, patient, and treats you with respect. Chris’s demeanor is very calming and he doesn’t use any sort of high pressure tactics. He lays everything out for you about the process and helps you make decisions that are in your best interest. Our loan processor was also very efficient and quick. Owning’s rates are so much better than everyone else’s, traditional banks cannot compete. I recently  referred a friend and she sent us a bottle of wine because her experience was also good.</review><response>{'time': 1606340345374, 'text': 'Glad to hear you and your friend had such great experiences with Owning, Jack.

From start to finish, it was the easiest, refinance that I’ve ever done. David K., my loan agent was friendly, easy to communicate with, and patient. It was so fast, I honestly couldn’t believe it. It started with me filling out their refinance tool calculator, someone called me within 30 minutes (with my permission) and the refi was closed within weeks. Unbelievable, if I hadn’t gone through it myself. Did I mention that my rate was the lowest, no-cost loan?<//text>

A coworker mentioned refinancing his home and how simple and easy it was at no cost to him and his wife. Also, the amount of money they would be saving monthly on their mortgage payment.
I decided to give Owning a try with an online request and I immediately received a call from a representative. That same person assisted me through the majority of the process. I was able to save $416 a month on my mortgage payment on a 30 year loan with no appraisal or cost to me. Once I mentioned that to my sister, she had Owning help her refinance within 2 weeks. She did have an appraisal on her home, but did not have to pay. I am currently referring Owning to coworkers. My wife and I are very pleased with service that was provided by Owning.

Thank you Owning.<//Text>

<Text>This was the easiest refinance my husband and I have ever completed.  The loan was fully funded and our previous mortgage was paid off within four weeks.  Owning offered the lowest interest rate of the six lenders I contacted and there was a bonus of no fees! Jason was very easy to work with and responsive to my questions. We have already recommended Jason and owning.com to a friend who is currently in the process of refinancing his home. I would highly recommend Jason and this company!</Text><Date>1591803632484<//Date>< user_name>

All is well that ends well. Although the transition was rocky when they got bought out, I believe they are a generally good company who cares. It was a little ridiculous that it took over two months and two contract signings to refi because of their buyout, but in the end we got a great rate and very low refi charges.</text>

I have done the loan through Owning. Their whole loan process is extremely easy and able to close my loan with in 12 days (literally 12 days...wow). Starting from the first loan officer REO-nick and then LP-Ted,  contacted me regularly and walked me through the process. They are very helpful to answer all of my questions at anytime of the day; even at business or late night hours. All the team members are very knowledgeable of all the loans available and will assist to answer your questions. Thank you Owning to help me on refinance my home loans. I have referred to 15 of my friends and all of them went with the same team members and that is the confidence they have provided to us.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Unlike our previous refinance experiences, the amount of supporting documents that we had to submit to Karen Castro and Michael Joseph from Owning was the least that we had seen.  The electronic signing process was quick and easy.  Owning had paid for all the costs that were associated with the loan.  We know friends who have been doing loans but the rate they offered us was unbeatable.
Best of all, the services that we received from Karen Castro and Michael Joseph were far beyond our expectations. They quickly resolved our requests, answered our inquiries, and made the loan process so "easily social distancing".
We haven't met Karen Castro and Michael Joseph from Owning in person but we are very satisfied with the loan and the services that they had provide us and we will recommend them to our friends and relatives.</Review>< Pics>

I called Owning after another company stopped funding refis. I explained to Pat what I was looking for and he clearly communicated what I would need to get the rate locked and the deal done. I decided to move forward and supplied all the documentation required. Pat and Owning had the refi done in about 14 business days with ZERO headaches. If you know you qualify for the deal you're looking for this is a great place to get it done. I'll be recommending Owning to family and friends.<//text>

<Review>Owning "knocked it out of the park", they went above and beyond and exceeded expectations. I have never had a smoother, easier, quick experience with something as important as my mortgage. Kirsten and Franz ROCK!!! They were with us every step of the way. Thank you for my "last Refi", we are truly grateful.<//Review><UserId.>101439536646492842595< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

I decided to take advantage of the low interest rate and refinance my mortgage.  I never worked with online loan company before, but working with Owning has been an excellent experience.  From the date I filed the application to funding, the process was completed within three weeks.  All documents were sent through emails with clear instructions how to complete and sign the forms. They even arranged agent to come to my house to notarize the closing documents.  Both Alexander and Kim were very responsive and they answered all my questions promptly.  Overall, the whole process is completed without any hassle.<//Review>

Owning.com had extremely competitive rates, excellent website portal, and our loan officer, Peter S, was really really great about communication.  Our loan processor, Carina, was also great to work with as well.  Initial engagement to signing & closing was less than a month!!!<//text>

After much research about the possibility of refinancing our home mortgage  to take advantage of today's very low interest rates we decided to give Owning a try.  Less than three weeks later we now have a new mortgage with an unbeatable rate and our new monthly payments are significantly lower than before.  Having refinanced homes in the past I can tell you that Owning made the process much easier than other financial institutions we dealt with, including our beloved credit union.  We couldn't be happier.  THANKS Owning!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

I recently refi’d my mortgage with Owning and loved the experience. From my initial contact with Mel N (LO) to Henry N (Processor), everything was awesome. They both kept me informed of what was happening and what was coming up. I contacted Mel on 9/1 to get the process started and we signed docs on 9/11. Unbelievable. If I need to do another refi, I will definitely reach out to Owning again.</text>

When my cousin first introduced me to Owning, I was hesitant. I was unsure whether this was a reputable company. I was fortunate to work with Trung Ha and Gary Do (both of them helped processed the loan for me). They were very professional, courteous, and kept me updated the entire time. My loan only took 1 month to process. I am very pleased with my refinancing experience.< /Text>

I had a wonderful experience with Owning.com. We did a refi with cash out and the process was seamless and we closed and received funding even sooner than expected.

I was impressed with the swiftness and professionalism of the entire process and everyone I dealt with. Jordan Lee, our agent, was extremely responsive every time I contacted him via email as well as phone. Phuong Dao, our loan processor was also very responsive. Refinance rate was very competitive. I would highly recommend Owning and in fact a relative going through a refinance with them and having the same great experience.< /Review>

< review>
We refinanced with owning to save a few hundreds dollars a month. But it has now been two months since the loan has closed and they still haven't transfered  the loan to a mortgage processor. Last month, after multiple attempts to reach them, they finally responded to us FIVE days before our mortgage payment was due , only to let us know where to send our payment. This month, our payment is due within a week, but we still haven't heard anything from Owning. Save a few hundreds dollars and risk a financial ruin with Owning...They work very fast to close the loan then leave you hanging dry.

Owning reached out and clarified payment issue after my previous review. The mortgage still hasn't transferred to a loan processor, but now I have a better idea of where to make my payment each month. I wish that there was more communication to inform us of the situation after the loan was closed so that we weren't left in the dark.< /review>

Very fast and efficient from start to end.  I entered my info in the evening, and I got a call the next day. Within the same week, I was already in underwriting.  Closed within 2 weeks from start to beginning.  I had refi around x3 or x4 times this year and this is by far the most efficient company I have worked with.</review>

Refinancing with Owning went well. The loan officer Tom Nguyen and loan processor Julie Kim were very helpful and patient with my questions. They answered  all my concerns and really helped make the process simple.

Thank you.<//Review>

<text>We had an awesome experience with our loan agent Kevin and Loan professor Heidi. They took the time to look into our file and provided us with a great offer. They were very professional and prompt in their responses. Anytime I had a question or wanted an update, Heidi was amazing at how quickly she responded. I can’t thank Kevin enough for giving our file another look because we were able to get a better payment. Thank you Owning, I have already referred you to friends and family!

Surprisingly fast process. Great rates, very professional, and personable people to work with. Robert Nguyen, and Nikki Pezlz, were our representatives. They kept us up to speed throughout the very short process. Scheduled the appraisal inspection and notary within 2 weeks of beginning the process. I can't believe how fast this went. The last time I financed a house with a different company, it took forever. This company really knows what they are doing. I would highly recommend them. This team was outstanding!</text>

<Text>We had a wonderful experience with Owning.  Our loan officer Michelle Crawford handled all the details quickly and efficiently.  I was impressed with the way she anticipating issues and solved them proactively.  Michelle built our confidence by communicating regularly keeping us up to date with the process. I  especially appreciated her up beat friendly attitude and confident approach.  This process was easy and if I may say a nice change from other experiences we have had.

Thank you,

Prior to reaching out to Owning, I had worked with my own mortgage company to re-fi our home. This process was a nightmare and after four months, I terminated the loan process. Once I started the process with Owning, loan approval was reached within 15 days. Within less than 30 days, the loan funded and all payoffs were completed. Jesse Aguilar started the process and Samiera Salman finished it. Both maintained constant contact with me, kept a positive attitude, and calmly made requests as needed.

I refinanced during the pandemic to help save money and the people at Owning were incredible. Dan Milicevic was great. He made the process very easy for me, and reviewed the loan paperwork with me in the beginning before any documents were signed. And Nancy Lee was so on top of everything and amazing about staying in constant contact with me so that the loan process itself went very smooth. I was amazed at how fast they were able to get the refinance done. I believe it took less than two weeks to complete the entire process. And Owning stayed true to its word of no closing costs. And despite the fact that I had a jumbo loan, the rate they gave me was incredible. I don’t anticipate ever having to refinance again (I am very happy with my current rate)  but if I did, I would definitely use them again and I would definitely recommend this company to a friend.< /Review>

I had a great experience with Owning.com. Derek took care of all my needs and answered all my questions and gave me great rate. This was one of the easiest and cheapest re-finance that I was able to get done with 0 closing cost. They took care of sending notary to my home and got everything done in the timely manner. Kelly too was great in taking care of all the paperwork. I would highly recommend Owning to all my friends and colleagues.</review>

<Review>I wanted to take the time to do a review as my experience with Owning was excellent.   Darren and Matt from Owning helped us complete our refinance loan.  They were both very helpful and responded to any questions or calls even after hours.  I can say I got out of paying thousands in fees with original lender that I had started my loan with.  The closing process was super fast and we got a lower rate.  I am very happy with my loan and would highly recommend Owning.</Review>< Pictures>

Easy-peasy refi. I filled out the online form on 7/17/2020 and was contacted by Jack Bati the same day. He told me what documents he needed to initiate the loan and I emailed them to him. A few days later I was passed on to loan processer Andrew Kiemm.  He outlined the process and timeline for the loan. Eleven days later, Nick Ferguson, the notary came to our house for use to sign the loan papers. ON 8/6 our loan closed.
This was the easiest, quickest no cost refi that I ever had. Highly recommend!< /text>

I have re-financed with Owning twice.  Owning is driving a new way many typical mortgages are obtained in the market.  Thier offerings and customer experience are exceptional compared to traditional lenders and practices.  This is probably the way I will do all mortgage loans or refinacing in the future!<//review>

This was simply the fastest no hassle refi ever.  I appreciate the fact that Owning publishes the rates you can expect to get right on their home page and it is updated frequently.  Most other institutions ask you to painfully fill in a ton of info just to have someone contact you later with what rates are available.  My refi was done in basically two weeks, and was just a matter of selecting from 4 options presented to me based on the type of loans I expressed interest in and then the application was done securely online via e-sign, followed by a visit by the appraiser and finally a notary to officially sign the loan.  Robert, my loan officer, and John, my loan processor took care of everything along the way, letting me know what to expect next, making it the easiest no cost refi ever.  So cool that you can do practically everything online (except for appraisal and final signing), and they were there guiding you the whole time via timely email communications.  Just one 5 minute phone call to exchange some initial info, and the only people I had to meet in the entire process was the appraiser and notary that Robert and John arranged for me.  Literally no effort on my part aside from collecting and uploading the standard financial documentation to the secure site and signing the loan itself with the notary.  All documentation including info like your loan application, credit report and appraisal is all available for download online so it was very convenient.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1610154109590, 'text': 'Thank you for the thorough review!'}<//resp>< gmapID>

I am very happy with my experience with Owning. It was very very easy start to finish.

My Loan Originator Esteven Dam was great. Later on in the process my Loan Processor Julie Kim took over and I can't speak highly enough of Julie. Very responsive, almost instantly whenever I emailed her a question. I had a very good experience with Steven and Julie.</review>

Owning Corporation was the company I went with for my first refinance of my first home. My refinance turned out to be more complex than originally thought, in part due to solar loans attached to the property. Despite the complexity and unexpected hiccups, Owning was prompt in their responses and consistently ensured I was not hung out to dry.

The good: Response times were always fast. The employees I worked with were always professional and prompt. All signing that could be done electronically was done so, easing the amount of wet signatures needed on signing days. Documentation was easy to follow. Owning ended up lowering my interest rate as rates continued to slide.

The less-than-good: While everyone I worked with was a pleasure and most unexpected hiccups were dealt with near perfectly, some things fell through the cracks. Had I not doublechecked some of the refinance work after signing, I would have been left paying late penalties on property tax payments. This particular issue may have arisen on Owning or the Title office's behalf, but either way I felt it necessary to dock a star as I was the one to discover the error and did have to contact more than once to get it resolved. However, once the information made it to the proper person, the response was impossibly fast and to my satisfaction.

Overall, I feel most people will have a 5-star experience with Owning and the worst one could expect would be a 4-star. On a personal level, I would likely work with them again for a future refinance.< /Text>

I just want to reiterate what a great experience we had refinancing our home. Danny and Michelle are absolutely wonderful. Very honest
Quick and to the point. Amazing smooth process. I had a bad experience with a company that boasts working with UHM; terrible idea.
You can not go wrong with Danny snd Michelle.

I was in the middle of a Refi with my current lender.  They had taken at that point almost 10 weeks and they were still not finished.  Just for an option I checked online and found Owning Corp.  The rate they were advertising was lower than the new rate my existing lender was offering.  I contacted them and in two weeks they were done.  They gave me the best rate by far, and they paid the closing cost.  On top of that their service was 5 star !  Highly recommend them to all.</Text>

I filled out a form on their website which only asked for minimal information (most sites ask for a lot of personal information) and got a call very quickly. We provided a few documents and within 10 days we were signing and 10 days after that it was all done. We’ve had a few mortgages and one previous refinance and this the easiest by a long shot. And it really was zero closing costs and a very good rate.< /text></record>

This was by far the quickest and most efficient mortgage or re-fi we have ever done.  21 days from initial call to escrow close.  All the representatives I dealt with were knowledgeable, friendly and responsive.  Just call Owning!! Kudos to Annamae and Kim that made this experience wonderful.<//Review>

Great and  Fast Service.  I highly recomnmend Mrs. Angie Pham (Loan Originator) and Henry Nguyen (Loan Processor).  They work very hard to get your loan done fast.  Ask them when you apply.  I got both refinance with them.  Owning is the best one for me.</Review>

My originator Phoebe Tran was great! She was quick and super nice in reminding me to send in my docs and was always ready to answer my questions. Gary do our loan processor was equally efficient and knowledgeable. The team got everything done so quickly and they sent out a notary to the house who had a mask on, was fast but took the time to answer any questions and was so sweet to our kiddos! Thank you owning for refinancing for us so fast it was an amazing experience. I got referred to this company by a coworker and I’ve already referred them out a bunch of time already!< /review>

<text>Owning is a terrific company. This is my 2nd time using their services. The team worked quickly and everyone I worked with was great. Frank Tang & Tim Grino were both professional and provided great communication throughout the process. And the time it took to fund the loan....incredible! I submitted my finances on a Sunday, by Wednesday the appraisal was done, loan was approved by Saturday, signed docs a week later and funded by the third week! And this was all during December around Xmas when everyone else was watching Netflix! Love Owning and would highly recommend them.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>So I had an over great/ positive experience refinancing our home loan with owning. Both Loan Agent Paul and Loan Officer Dexter were professional, knowledgeable and soo efficient that we finished the entire refi in about 2 weeks - FASTEST EVER! Since everything went to so incredibly smoothly and unbelievably fast, we were definitely very satisfied with the overall process with your team - Paul and Dexter in particular 😉 Since our overall experience with owning was nothing but positive, we would rate them a strong 5 😊 and because of that, we have already recommended owning to family and friends (some have already used owning too).</Text>< user>

Refinanced many homes over the years and I have never been involved with a finance company as efficient, upfront, and sophisticated as Owning. From start to finish, it took a bit over 2 weeks.. no wasted time retrieving small, useless proof of data. They also keep you posted the entire time. Just a great overall experience.

We recently did a refinance through Owning.com.  Prior to contacting them, we were struggling to refinance with our previous lender that we held our mortgage with, as we thought it would be easier.   Sadly, after 4 months  and countless attempts to understand what was holding things up, they cancelled our application saying it was out there too long (their fault).  We were referred to Owning by a friend shorthy thereafter and we couldnt believe the difference.   John Nguyen was our initial contact.  He worked diligently that day into the early evening, before a holiday,  to get our loan process started.  He was always quick to respond via text, phone or email to any questions or concerns we had.  Andrew processed the loan and was quick and efficient.  Although we did not have much direct contact with him,  the process was smooth and seemless!  We couldn't believe it when our loan documents were ready to sign within 3 weeks of beginning the process.  To top it off they sent a signer to our home!  We can recommened Owning for refinance with complete confidence!<//review>

<Name>Mel Borja</Name><Text>My wife and I never had a plan of refinancing our current mortgage until one day I saw Owning ads commercial on TV.  The rates that was advertised at that time was  so low that I can’t believed in my own eyes and that I can’t bypass the opportunity of refinancing. I spoke with James and he professionally answered all my questions. He gave me interest rates options and not once he pressured me in making  any abrupt decision. Geoff on the other hand seamlessly processed our paperwork and made it all possible that everything will go through without any delay.  Moreso, please keep Mr. Danny Gonzalez on your payroll as he is a very important part of your team/organization  in making sure all your customers expectations has been met.

My overall experienced in refinancing with Owning was a “WOW”  experience and way better that riding Pirates of the Caribbean @ Disneyland Resort and way better than doing business with banks and other loan company. It was so easy and very precise with their objective to meet my expectations. Doing business with Owning feels like you are member of their family. You will not be treated like the adopted child but will be treated like Royalty.

Wishing Owning Corporations more power and best wishes to all of your staff.

Be Well, Stay Safe, and Healthy

<Review>I absolutely recommend Owning they offer the best rates, excellent and fast service. This is our 2nd time working with Hai Nguyen and again we are impressed with his professionalism and excellent customer service.

Contacted Owning for a quote on current re-fi rates and was extremely pleased on how fast and easy the process was.   Our loan officer’s Rebecca and Cate worked hard and fast to get the loan funded within 3 weeks.  From start to finish it was great.   They both answered emails/calls promptly.  I highly recommend Owning!<//Review>

From initial contact till the signing the final loan docs, Owning and it's agents delivered superb service. David was a pleasure to work with, attentive, informative, and timely. Tiffany quickly and efficiently responded to our emails and requests for adjustments to the final terms. I would definitely do business here again and recommend them to anyone interested in a refi or home loan!  Not to mention they offer the lowest rate in the industry!</Text>

<Review>I have had positive refi experiences with other lenders, but working with Owning was another level. This was the smoothest and most efficient refi I have had. From the initial email inquiry to signing at closing was 10-days! I know this may be a bit abnormal, and several factors determine closing, but it highlights the efficiency of Owning's process. Rudy, my loan agent was quick to respond to my questions and showed genuine interest in helping me get the best rate/terms. Christina, my loan processor, moved the loan review and closing along quickly, and most importantly to me, answered in detail all of my questions along the way. There were no surprise fees, abnormal charges, or last-minute changes/documents needed.< /Review>< Resp>

<review>I wanted to refinance my house so I started calling. I talked to 7 mortgage company but Bo Lucas from OWNING sounds the person that I can trust, and I'm not wrong he really is. He gave me all the information I need to know and answers all my questions through email or by phone right away all throughout the process. He goes above and beyond to help me get a better rate. He is very professional, respectful, kind, honest and very knowledgeable. And even Anna Gonzales helps me with all the requirement’s I need to send back to them. She is also another person I can trust and rely on. She also answers back even after working hours. So, with the help of these two amazing people I refinance my house in just 20 days. Thank You very much again Bo and Anna for all your help, Five STARS is not even enough you deserves 10 STARS. I can't thank you enough for the help you given me. Stay Safe and God Bless.< /review>< Pics>

Amazingly low rates and the best refi experience I have ever had!  It was so quick and easy!  I received excellent customer service with immediate assistance, including evenings and weekends, which expedited the whole process.  My agent Tony was really helpful and responsive as was my processor, Kim, who made everything move forward without a hitch. I never knew refinancing could be so easy and without stress.  I highly recommend Owning and will definitely use Owning for my next refi!</text>

From my experience working with the amazing team at Owning, I would absolutely recommend them if you are considering refinancing your current Mortgage.  If you have done your homework then you know that Owning is one of, if not the best deal out there.  The Team that helped me, Cindy Dang and Hai Nguyen really took the time to make sure they did everything they possibly could to make the refinance process go as smoothly as possible.  I would also like to give a special thanks to the Underwriter Adam Wert for taking the time to review and approve my refinance! This team is on top of their game and I enjoyed working with them through everything.  I realize that this is a busy time because the rates are low,  and everyone is dealing with the stress of a Pandemic, but through it all this team really shines and puts the customer first no matter what.  Thanks again Owning!</Review>

Easy experience. Kept me informed often. Quick process. Took about two weeks. I refinanced to a 15-year 2.6% loan, with no points purchased and no closing costs (requires great credit and minimum loan amount). They could not be beat. Would high recommend. Everyone I dealt with was professional and kept me in the loop at all times< /text>

I’m so glad that I called Owning to refinance our home. Not only did we get an amazingly low rate, saving hundreds, they also were able to completely eliminate our PMI, saving us even more!! Now our new mortgage payment is almost $600 less than before! They were fast, efficient, and very helpful through the entire process. I highly recommend calling them NOW!!</Review>

Just completed our refinance with Owning and the process was quick, easy, and zero stress! We bought our house in 2018 when rates were much higher and I'm happy to say that we are now saving over $500 a month on our mortgage payment. We also got the advertised rate with no closing costs so I appreciate the low rates they advertise are what you will actually get. Thank you to Kevin and Paolo for helping us through the refinance process - we couldn't be more pleased.</Text>

< Review>
This was the easiest and quickest mortgage refinance we have ever done.  We didn't have to pay anything out of pocket and we are reducing our monthly mortgage payment and cutting years of the total length of the loan.  I want to personally thank  **Steven Medici and Darren O'Neil** for all your hard work and making sure everything went through smoothly.  I highly recommend their services and I would make sure you ask specifically for them.</Review>

Owning was outstanding!  I was working with Owning and another lender, and decided to go with the other lender. They sat on my paperwork for six weeks and then asked me for information the information they needed. That put me in a huge bind.  When I contacted Owning again,  Jack Bati jumped on it immediately I got my loan processed in 2 1/2 weeks!  They are amazing!<//Text>

Using Owning for my refi was a tremendous experience.  The time I saved, the accuracy in their quotes along with the fact there was never any hidden surprises (FEES) was awesome. Like the great commercials say "Bud, I crushed it"!!!!  Thanks Owning, this really may be my last refi.< /text>

<Review>I would recommend Owning if you are shopping for a refi.  I opened the application on Nov 22, and was completely processed and funded within 30 days.  Peter Suk and Nina Rawlings made it happen.  They were professional and efficient, answered my questions, and made the process very easy.  Happy New Year Owning!

<name>David Winner< /name><Date>1599782534717</Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>This is my second refi with Owning. Both times have been the smoothest and easiest refi I have ever done. From 1st call the closing, less than 10 days. So simple, best rates available and 0 cost! This is no joke. The 1st time around I thought it was to good to be true, so I shopped with two other firms and both of them we so expensive. They both wanted to give me a good rate but at a cost of a point. Owning, is true to their advertising. I am not the best at writing reviews and I usually only write negative reviews to companies that deserve them. But with Owning I make this exception because the experierce and service they provide are outstanding. My 1st refi, I got a 3.75apr on a 30 year fixed, jumbo. And I thought that would be it. Now I just got a 2.625apr on a 30 year fixed jumbo. Outstanding!!! I am now saving almost 5K a year. Thank you owning. And to my loan officer Jeremiah Gillman , and Processor Nikki Pelzl, job well done. Very happy and loyal client!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Very fast refinancing, they reply very quickly any time of a day or night. There were few typos/ mistakes in my inital loan application done over the phone which kept carrying on through other documents, so double check everything over the phone as it seems they can not amend the application or loan estimate afterwards. Except those typos everything else was great. Super fast from start to finish. Rates also excellent.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>The absolute worst! I've refinanced several times and Owning was unbelievably terrible. My loan should have been very simple, no cash out, great LTV ratio and Owning found a way to screw it up. My previous mortgage servicer issued a payoff statement to them that was very clear about what was needed to payoff the loan. Unbeknown to me at the time, Owning decided to pay a completely different amount that was several hundred dollars short. Because of this, my servicer did not accept the partial payment. When it was finally brought my attention 3 weeks later that Owning did not pay in full, I had accumulated 770 dollars of additional mortgage interest that I was forced to pay out of pocket. I thought that Owning would certainly own their mistake and reimburse my expense. Boy was I wrong, after weeks working with Renan and Danny in customer service they accomplished nothing and refused to take any ownership of the error. I will never work with them again and I caution anyone to steer clear. There are plenty of other competent lenders out there that are trustworthy.

Edit: Owning, I know what happened and I’ve already worked with your team. They are the problem. Typical canned response from an uninformed and unsatisfactory business. Buyer beware!< /text>< pictures>

Awesome refi experience!!! First time refinancing our house and Owning made it so easy and simple. Brad T (Mortgage Loan Originator) reached out and explained the process to me and everything that I needed. Brad was very friendly and professional, he answered all my questions (even during the holidays and the weekend) within a day if not sooner. I was then helped by Lisa V (Loan Processor) that was just as friendly and professional, she also responded to my questions within the same timeframe as Brad. I had many questions during this process- Lisa was very knowledgeable and patient with me. Everything was done via phone, email and Docusign online. Overall, I would highly recommend doing a refi with Owning.</review>

<text>Our refi process went super smooth.  I did three refi's in the past 12 months, one with PNC, Chase and now Owning.  The processor Natalie Farraj was the easiest to work with and got things closed in about 20 days while the process with the other two banks took months.

Good experience with Owning for refinancing a mortgage loan. My loan officer, Mark, was very helpful and patient with me while I asked many questions and shopped around with other mortgage companies. I went with Owning because they gave me the best rate and I felt I could trust them. My loan processor, Helen, was very responsive and available. It was a smooth process to end.</Text>

<Text>I wished I had known about Owning  Corporation earlier.  I wasted so much time looking for a mortgage company that would give me the best interest rate and the closing cost to refinance my mortgage.  But my search was over when I found Owning.  Rudy Crawford and Christina Nunez made the whole process so easy and smooth and the best part was that I didn't have to pay any closing cost!!  Why would anyone go to other companies unless they want to throw their money away?< /Text><Name>Crystal Cliame< /Name>< Rate>

The refinance process with Owning was the easiest and quickest refinance I have ever done. Being prepared with all my documents was important and paid off as Dan M. my mortgage originator kick everything off after one call of about 30 mins where he explained all steps to be done and after 10 days I had a notary in my house to sign documents. Their tool to upload documents was easy to use and best of all their lowest rates and no closing costs, couldn't find anything better.</Text>

I started my application with Owning (11-27-20) and in 1 1/2 weeks I was signing loan documents (12-05-20), I gave them everything they requested (check stubs, bank statements ect...) on the same day they requested it. I was amazed at how quick everything was going. We were set to close in exactly 2 weeks (12-10-20), then on the day of closing I contacted owning and they told me the notary didn't return the papers right away and that the file was in audit, because of the Covid 19 it would take some time. It took until the following week and the loan funded (12-16-20). We close in less than 3 weeks from the day of my application. My application was taken by Paul Grino and my loan processor was Edgar Moreno, they were both quick to respond, very professional and always available. My APR is 2.625% and I tell everyone about my loan experience with Owning. I would highly recommend Owning.</review>

I was referred by my co worker Benny Ventura. When I first called on November 4th Jesse Sosa who was very caring and pleasant, he took all needed information from me . Next day I got a call from Nina Rawlings who was so nice and extremely knowledgeable. She made me feel very comfortable and was very helpful with everything I needed to provide. In less then 30 days my loan was approved and closed. I highly recommend Owning Corporation. Thank you Jesse and Nina for all your hard work with my mortgage. Sincerely, Silvia A Soto.<//text>

The refinance process was extremely fast, smooth and efficient.  From the date I completed the on-line application to pay-off of my prior loan was 3 weeks.  I asked up front how Owning made money on a no-cost loan, how long would the process take, and was it really no cost to me.  It was, I only paid for the interest on the loan amount as I would do anyway; and that was calculated into the loan amount.  Brooks answered all my questions clearly.  Brooks and Cindy were proactive and clear with  communication every step of the process.  I have already referred Owning to 3 people.<//review>

I had a good experience with Owning. They delivered on what they promised. Didn’t have to pay anything other than some property taxes that I knew I would have to pay when changing lenders. If your credit is good and your loan amount falls within their parameters you should be good. Thanks Rudy and Christina for your quick responses.<//text>

They gave me great rate and it took less than 10 days from my first call to the company to the day I signed the documents. I worked with Ron Piri and Emily Le as my agent and processor. Both guys very professional, quick in transactions, and always available to answer my questions and emails even in late night or over the weekend.
I highly recommend Ron, Emily and Owning and I would definitely go to them for my future mortgage needs.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1595633424504, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the great review!'}<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /gmapID></record>

<date>1599610618704< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>If this isn't your first rodeo with mortgage and you're a AAA client (great credit, low LTV, organized documents, etc), then Owning is great. When I see these advertisements for such low rates I think there's a catch, but after doing my due diligence I moved forward. I just closed my refinance and got 2.5% with no closing costs and zero issues during the quick process; saving me $380 a month. Insane! NOW, if you're not familiar with the process and need lots of help throughout, or you're not a target client (see below), then this may not be the best route for you. The communication once it goes into underwriting is brisk, no-frills, low hand-holding, but nevertheless accurate, so that could frustrate many ppl out there. It's obvious this is a numbers game and Owning is very selective on it's target clients, which is good business practice. RECOMMENDATION to all - read the Disclosures page on their website so you understand who the "solid target client" is I'm referring to... read "Loan Assumptions" and "Closing Costs"... some of these negative reviews wouldn't be here if ppl read this first and understood who owning is targeting before they jumped into trying to get the great deal.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have refinanced my mortgage numerous times and my recent experience with Owning Corporation was the best by far. From my initial contact with the loan agent to the loan processor and the administrative staff, the level of customer service was exceptional. Everyone answered my questions or made sure to get the answer in a timely and efficient manner. When an unforeseen issue (not their fault) came up during the loan approval process, I was notified immediately and kept informed until it was resolved. When this resulted in a delay beyond my rate lock period, they still honored the quoted rate. After they sold the loan, they were very helpful in transitioning to the new lender. Should I ever have the need to refinance again, I will definitely contact Owning and specifically ask for the agent and processor that assisted me—they were awesome like their rates.</Text>

Had my loan with Andrew and Ana. I cannot thank them enough. Still trying to figure out how to send them cookies. But it was all very straight forward, very easy. From the beginning Andrew walked me through everything. Then Ana was very quick and precise at closing and funding my loan. They offer competitive rates. But their service is the real bonus.

<Date>1590168932814<//Date><Review>This was the easiest refinancing I have ever done. When they say no cost, they do mean no cost. The only cost was related to paying my current loan. Alexander Ali (my agent) took his time explaining the details of the loan and the charges. Kim Truong was very helpful and quickly responded to my questions. The complete process took a little over 3 weeks. Now I have a loan at 2.625% (incredible). Very grateful for your work. Thank you Alex and Kim.<//Review>< pictures>

It was a very smooth refi process for us. Marco Munoz was our loan officer. He is very responsive and efficient, all our emails and phone calls were returned promptly. The best part is, three months after my loan was closed, I found that I wasn't clear on the closing settlement amount. I contacted Marco, then got follow-up call and email from Owning the next day. Renan Vazquez at Customer Success team contacted me and accommodated my request immediately, no hassle. Also, Owning's  partnering escrow company is also very good: the representatives are courteous and caring. They also took my inquiry seriously. So the whole experience is 5-star!</Text>

The Owning Re-Fi Loan closed 19 days after my 1st inquiry.
I was skeptical to contact Owning after hearing the attractive radio ad, it was too good to be true, right? But when a local mortgage processor referred me to Owning ("No one can beat them in CA"), I filled out the online form.
Hai Nguyen, Loan Originator, took it from there. The  process was seamless and simple, with all questions and concerns answered honestly and promptly. Load Processor, Paul Pappas walked me through the rest of the process. What has been tedious and laborious in the past, Owning Corp has circled back to the simple wheel while maintaining the integrity of each spoke!<//Review>

We are extremely happy with our refinancing experience!! We tried with other companies for several months with lack of response.. a friend recommended Owning Corporation to us, we gave them a call and the process was sooo easy and fast. Henry Vanyan gave us the lowest rate possible and the process is fast, a couple weeks to close. Henry Vanyan and Van Tran explained everything to us, gave us the best rates and we couldn’t be happier! Highly recommended them!< /Review>

My wife and I have bought a home before and done refi's over the years, BUT this was the Smoothest, Most Professional, Courteous, and Pleasant financial experience either of us have ever had!!  Direct talk, straight facts and solid advice when we asked helped us make a Terrific decision taking advantage of the current low interest rates.  We reduced our monthly payment significantly!.

Outstanding job taking care of customer.
Chris was able to take care of my previous mortgage from a bit high APR down to the current minimum APR during that time which is very very low. I have not seen an APR that was locked at 2.25 with the same APY. Owning Corp is legit.< /text>

These guys are FAST and PROFESSIONAL!  Rick R. and Paul P.  always got right back to me when I had questions and made the process as simple as possible. We closed our loan a week after we applied, and less than a week after that, they paid off our old mortgage! It was warp speed! We are going to save over $600 a month and couldn't be happier!<//Review>

<Text>My overall experience with Owning Corporation was great and like no other.. I was referred to Owning by my brother and he too was 100% satisfied.  I have purchased and refinanced a few times and no one has been more expedient and with no hassles than Owning Corporation.  Graham and Tania were the two agents who assisted me and were complete professionals.  They received, reviewed, sent the necessary documents the same day in most cases.   I was pleasantly surprised on how quickly we were able to finalize and close my refinance.  The best part is that I was able to save money on my loan!!!
I would recommend Owning Corporation and will welcome their services once again in the future.</Text>< pictures>

However, the whole experience was flawless. I refinanced at what I think was the lowest rate in the market at the time, and it cost me absolutely nothing--no closing costs, no points, no fees, nothing.  The process was very easy.  The two guys I worked with, Michael Lamour and Edgar Moreno, were extremely responsive, answered all my questions and returned all my phone calls.  It really could not have been easier.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1600704192495</Time>< Gmap_id>

A+ for pretty everything from A to Z in the loan process.  From the ease of the application process, the limited documentation (and time) needed to have my loan funded, Owning.com was a breeze.
The only (minor) complaint I have was the limited correspondence and updates provided to me during the loan processing phase.  But that was not enough for me to take it down to a 4-star rating.<//review>

The whole process with Owning to refinance was quick and easy. I was impressed with how responsive our loan originator and loan processor were during the refinance. I would recommend Owning to anyone looking to take advantage of new rates and/or pull out some money.<//Review>

A friend recommended Owning due to a prior positive experience with a re-fi. I was a little skeptical since I really hadn’t heard of the company before, but I’m sold now!

Peter Suk was my loan officer, and I can’t say enough good things about him. He made the process much less intimidating. He was considerate, patient, and a great communicator. Always prompt to respond to questions...and, believe me, I asked a lot of them! I appreciate how he took the time to explain things I didn’t completely understand. Owning was able to match a quote I got from another company which I very much appreciated. Patrik Chun was my loan processor, and he also communicated in a timely manner. He processed things efficiently, and my loan closed within 3 1/2 weeks of when the process first stated.

I chose Owning because of their professionalism...and Peter really gets the credit for that as the first person I spoke with. I never felt like I was getting the hard sell to use their company...can’t say that was the case with some of the other companies I reached out to. You only have one chance to make a first impression, and Owning made a positive impression from the first call.

Highly recommend Peter and Patrik for a smooth loan process from start to finish!<//text>

<time>1601592178027<//time><Text>Recently did a refinance with Owning after seeing one of their ads on TV. I entered some basic info on the web site and within 20 minutes I got a call from David Banh. David gathered some info and send me an electronic document to get the process started. David was very upfront about the rates  and options and it matched what was on the web-site. There was on bait and switch. An appraisal was required due to the property value and Owning paid for the appraisal as I did a no-cost loan. Next came the loan processing and Jennifer Tran did a fantastic job as well. An additional payment for my current mortgage had posted and Jennifer said they would take care of that from the escrow at close and that was. indeed the case. If you are looking to refinance I highly recommend Owning. My loan closed within 20 days, no hiccups, no surprises! If only other dealings in life were so simple. Thanks David and Jennifer for an excellent customer experience.</Text>< rating>

<review>Not a fan!  Our loan agent (Jeff) also provided faulty info to the loan processor that caused a one week delay as loan documents had to be prepared a second time to accommodate our title instructions.  Once we actually signed loan docs, it took another two weeks to fund and close the loan.  In addition, they miraculously funded the loan the day we asked about a lower rate that had been advertised and the funds then sat in escrow for another 3 days before they paid off the existing mortgage.

To cap things off, we had to contact them 3 times to get instructions as to where to mail our first mortgage payment.

I would NOT use them again.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1598576596419, 'text': "Hi David, we sincerely apologize for your experience.

<Review>Applying for refinancing my mortgage with Owning was so easy , the application process took less than 10 minutes. From application to loan singing was about 2 weeks. David the loan agent and Everet the processor were very responsive they either pick up the phone when I called or returned my call immediately. Overall I am very impressed with the way Owning handled my loan</Review><time>1595894741143< /time>< resp>

Loan was quick and easy! Excellent communication! Emails and phone calls were answered immediately, even on the Sunday after  the 4th of July. Honestly I was shocked! Very professional and easy to talk to. Was able to lower my monthly mortgage payment by $600 a month with no fees!<//Review>

<username>Bill W<//username><Text>2nd Refi this year, first with Owning.  Competitive rate and no lender fees was great, took about 4 weeks total mostly due to my existing bank's slowness getting a payoff statement which is obvious, they liked my higher interest loan didn't want to give it up lol.   Owning initial contact and loan processing contact both were super communicative, seemed to work all hours of the day and it was all a minimal hassle and information needed to close the loan.  Closing was easy with mobile notary paperwork, great experience, I'd use them again if rates drop even lower.<//Text>< date>

I was so afraid of the process of refinancing that it took me a couple of years to start it. Eventually my friend advised me to contact David Karmann at Owning. Wow, I wish I contacted Owning long before. They are so fast and clear with all the instructions and explanations. And David answers all my calls right away, no going to voice mail, or calling back later things :)< /Text>

Alre and Casey worked really hard to earn my business. I was shopping multiple lenders and comparing offers. A couple other lenders gave me the impression they were annoyed that I was shopping around. Other lenders seemed to suggest that I was a waste of their time, because they're so busy and they're the best. Alre and Casey from Owning stayed the course. Were respectful, very patient, and the upmost professionals. In the end I crunched the numbers and Owning won.<//text>

I can say with complete certainty that this was the fastest, most simplistic, and least stressful loan refinance I have EVER had!!! Absolutely flawless, and I’m quite a picky person. . .

I think most people go at the refinance process guarded and worried that they’re gonna miss something, certain that there’s gotta be a catch. I know I did. But I was totally wrong here. Owning was an upfront, quality mortgage refinance business. I was well-informed throughout the ENTIRE process, and felt I was given full disclosure the whole way. Quick and EASY!! Answered any and all questions I had!

Owning has without a doubt secured my highest recommendation to both family and friends!!

Such an incredibly valuable resource!!

Geoff and Tony were the BEST!!</text>

At first I was hesitant to go with a new online company for my refinancing needs, but after all was finished and done I was glad I made that choice. The refinancing process was quick and smooth, all completed within two weeks. My case wasn't that complicated, but the nimbleness of Owning Corp. is commendable. All the people from Owning that have worked with me on this were competent, and helpful. Overall, 5-star experience.

Note:  Soon after the loan was closed, there were two successive loan transfers, and my payments ended up being serviced by some third company -  so far so good, believe it will continue that way.< /Review>

<Review>I have never ever posted anything online but I had such a excellent experience with Owning, that I had to say something.  I’ve had dealt with many Morgage companies as I have many properties. I’ve reached out to my Morgage company that services my loans, but they could not help me. I felt abandoned by Rocket Morgage. I searched and did my homework I thank God  I found the company called OWNING. They  handled everything so fast, we were closing documents in 3 weeks. I will continue to do business and of course tell my friends about OWNING.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1606769617097, 'text': 'Glad to be there for you Dennis, thank you for the great review!'}</Response>< Pics>

<Text>I had an incredible experience getting my REFI through Owning.  NO I'm not getting paid to say this.  NO I'm not getting anything from saying this.  I'm just a regular person who is taking the time to write down my experience.

2 People I want to specifically mention Sydney Cook and Paul Seng.  Sydney was great, she answers every question completely and was so attentive to all my calls and emails.  Paul Seng did a great job as well in processing my loan and kept the pace going quickly.

I could not believe I was signing loan docs so quickly.  Everything went so smooth it was really enjoyable speaking to both Sydney and Paul.

I thought they only did REFI's but to my surprise they do regular home loans, VA etc.  So if we move or buy another home I will be giving Sydney and call again!

I had very bad service by 3 other lenders.  It was terrible.  2 of them advertise on the TV all the time but I will not put in writing who they are.  I could not believe the run around they both gave me, it was so frustrating.

Then I finally did our REFI through a bank that my wife knew of.  I will not put their name to paper either.  It took 45 days, came with nothing but problem after problem and alot of fees. (I didn't know any better)

I was very shy to do this again, but based on information from a friend I took the risk to do it again since the rates dropped again.

I'M SO GLAD I FOUND SYDNEY AND OWNING!</Text><GmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /GmapID>< Pictures>

<Review>I did refinanced my mortgage few times and my recent experience with Owning Corporation was the best by far. From my initial contact with the loan agent to the loan processor and the administrative staff, Notary,  the level of customer service was exceptional. They closed loan process within 8 days as promised rate lock. They were also suggesting right solution for each on of the mortgage situations. I referred few friends and taking care of them well as well.

Thanks< /Review>< Rate>

The easiest and fastest refi we ever did as it took about 2 weeks.  Jerry Escuadra was very well informed and professional as well as our loan processor Michelle Crawford.  Don't hesitate, would highly recommend!</Review>

Not thrilled with the Owning process.  Escrow was to close be 12/31/20 but it was dragged out til end of January.  The follow up by the escrow officer was not timely or professional.< /Text>

My experience with Owning was quite good.  No matter how good your product is the people who represent your company are very important for the success of your business.  Anne Strum and Inga McNair were the two people that I dealt with during the loan process and each were terrific representatives of your company.  Anne was great to work with in getting the loan approved, and Inga knew exactly what was needed in processing the paperwork that I handed in.  Other loans with banks had taken weeks or even months to process where this one went through in a few days!  Thank you both for your excellent service.....Michael Kay< /Text>

Heard about Owning on the radio for a while and I finally got in touch with them about refinance my current property.

I was impressed with how fast the process was.  I'd started the process on a Friday and by the weekend, I got pre-approval on my refinancing.  We schedule an appraisal in three weeks and we signed the docs the following week.  Total process took about 3.5 weeks.    This is one of the fastest re-finance program that I'd ever experienced.

I'd highly recommend this company to any one that would like to secure a new or refinance their mortgage.< /Text>

<Text>Overall Myra and Chantha did a great job and get 5 stars, with about a 100 emails from start to finish 9/2020 to 11/2020.  I even had a loan paperwork going with 2 other companies that were not very responsive so I asked Myra and Chantha to match their numbers so I could switch to them and they were able to make that happen.  Owning did well and I would use them again however I have some tips to make it a little more user friendly.  An approximate timeline and the steps could be outlined to help us know what to expect.  The 2 main reasons for the star deduction is the dashboard or lack there of is hard to manage.  Each email had its own link to its own page with documents.  No master list of what was signed or not.  Other lenders have a dashboard that you can easily see that you have submitted everything and signed everything which was very nice, Myra and Chantha kept me on track with emails so not a huge concern but room for improvement.  Also, After signing the loan docs with Notary I thought I was days away from having the loan funded however for whatever reason it was ~3 weeks before funding which left some room for concern that the loan got lost or wouldn't go through.  Again, Myra and Chantha were there to send some email updates.  A more proactive system could state the progress with estimated days or weeks to help the customers know what is going on behind the scenes.  In less than 1 month it was sold to another lender so thank you Owning for getting me a better APR.</Text>< pics>

<text>From start to finish, I had a grand total of 1.5 hours worth of work, including signing our docs.  The guts of the process took about 2 weeks to go from docs to close.  This was the easiest loan I have ever done in the history of loans.  Carlos had every question of mine answered within the first hour of knowing him. Gary our processor was lightning fast and accomplished everything he said he would do on the day he said he would do it.  Absolutely no fees.  I lived through it but it all still seems like it never happened - but it did.  Btw, Quicken loans couldnt do a loan for me and neither rocket whatever....OWNING is the way to go.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
My friend did a loan refinance through Owning and referred me to your company. I am extremely grateful Owning was able to help me combine my 1st and 2nd mortgages and even pay off ALL of my credit card debts. I've been waiting over 15 years to do this and Owning is the first Lender/RE Broker that has approved a cash out refinance for me. I have attempted to consolidate my debt multiple times over the years only to be denied each time. I will always be indebted to Owning for giving me a chance and approving my loan.

My Loan Officer, Masa Omura was awesome! He was extremely quick and responsive whenever I reached out to him. I previously worked in the industry and am able to gauge when someone is organized and on top of his duties. His level of customer service and professionalism is top notch! 😊

I loved how fast docs were ready for signing and that we could electronically sign most of the them. The notary that was sent to sign my docs was also great! I don't plan on refinancing in the future, but if I do, I'd happily go through Owning again and I would not hesitate to recommend Owning to my friends!

Another note, due to the COVID-19 situation right now, some parts of your process may be delayed. Knowing this, please be kind to your Loan Officers, Loan Processors, and anyone part of your process. This industry is extremely busy right now and these employees are working extremely hard to help you as the customers. Please be understanding if you don't receive a response right away. I can assure you that if you do contact Owning, you will receive a response if not sooner than later. I can attest that at times the individual that you are communicating with may not be able to help you directly, but they will forward your inquiry to the correct party to resolve your issue.

Once again, I highly recommend Owning and if you choose to go through them, I wish you all the best on your transaction!< /Review>

<Text>I found this company after neighbors in my NextDoor app were asking for about them. The neighbor said she heard their ad on the radio and was wondering if they were legit. After reading a few recommendations and experiences from my neighbors, I decided to look them up. They had excellent reviews on Yelp and so I decided to reach out to them. They offer an excellent rate with no closing costs, but I had to pay 1.5% to get very low interest rates. Jay the Mortgage Loan Orginator was excellent. He was quick to put the number and refinance options together. He sent me a pdf application form and highlighted the parts I needed for complete. And later sent me a list of documents and a secure website were I uploaded all the documents. The loan processor Ana was also very nice and communicative and guided us on what needed to be done. The refinance closed within 28 days of submitting my application. We are now waiting for Goodbye letter and name of who will be servicing our loan since Owning doesn't service the loans.  Also as of October 2020, I think Owning was only licensed to finance in California. I definitely would recommend Owning since they can cover the closing cost and will always match or beat any written offer you bring to them.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>The whole refi took less than three weeks. We contacted Darren O'Neil who gave us the plan and received our documentation, then he handed us over to Steve Medici who quickly and clearly processed the loan and kept us informed from start to finish. Appraisal was arranged and we got a copy of that before proceeding. We had a last minute question while signing the loan docs with a notary and Mr. Medici got back to us immediately. The notary they sent was very prompt, polite and efficient. Our loan has already been transferred and Owning's staff answered questions and explained where to send our payments. At that time , I had no net costs (no fees, points, etc.) and the rate was very competitive.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My husband I were very pleasantly surprised by our refi experience with Owning Corp.  We were dreading the process as we have been through it before, but Brooks & Tiffany were great.  They were both very helpful and efficient and the process was closed much quicker than we believed would be possible.  Great experience.  Give them a call.</text>

Fast, easy, friendly. If you have your documents to them timely, the whole process is quick! I came prepared and did what I was asked timely, and in just 23 days, from application to check in my hand, it was over!
I didnt spend a dime or lift a finger, literally. Oh, I opened the door at the house for the appraiser! And he was awesome too!
Try Owning, you'll like it, a lot!
I'll be using them from now on, I "Own" them for what's best for me and my family.
Hard working, Blue Collar Girl, with fair credit, Out!</review>

My team of Brian and Nina made this refinance a near painless experience. We were funded and done in less than 3 weeks in spite of my lack of technical resources. Availability and competence are two descriptors that come to mind. When I had to call in for assistance Nancy who answered the phone was able to solve my problem without having to transfer me anywhere! Amazing. Would recommend.  DO recommend.< /Text>

Lightning fast closing- under 3 weeks.  No problems, clear and efficient communication and process.  Our originator was Kevin Friedman and oh my goodness.. he is a rockstar!!  I don't think I ever waited more than 15 minutes for an email reply.  He and the loan processor- Heidi were on top of everything and communicated proactively!!  Absolutely ZERO complaints and in fact.. can't say enough amazing things about Kevin and Owning.</review>< Pictures>

Terrific experience. Loan was approved and we closed 10 days after my first call!  That was amazing.  Everyone from the loan officer Alexander to the processor Casey and the notary public were very friendly and informative. The loan was sold shortly afterword to a bank, and I was told this was likely to happen right from the start. Everyone went smoothly.  Very pleased with the whole refinance!</text>

<text>I had just completed the refinance of our home mortgage in June of 2020, to 2.5%, when I saw a TV commercial for the Owning Corp. advertising 1.75% interest. When I called the previous mortgage company and asked for the lower rate and was turned down as the loan had just funded. I called Owning and they said they would refinance but would have to charge a fee based on the low balance. When they told me the new mortgage payment the savings was only $20 per month. I told them it was not worth my time to complete the paperwork again. Within two weeks I received a call from Owning's Elvis Vuong. I told him I would still be interested but needed to save $100 per moth to be worth my time refinancing again. He was able to secure a new rate of 1.75% with a payment reduction of $88. In the meantime, my mortgage had been sold to CMG Mortgage in San Leandro, CA with one account number and after two months transferred to CMG Mortgage in New Jersey, with a different account number. Now my payment history showed I was delinquent on payments because CMG CA hadn't forwarded the payments to CMG New Jersey. During the time I was attempting to straighten out the payments with CMG, I received delinquent notices, followed by threats of foreclosure. Owning Corp. was understanding and helped with the process finally resolving the matter and completing the refinance. I now have a mortgage under 2%, a rate that will never be seen again. With Owning's help I secured a new loan without an appraisal (based on my home's equity) and as I had recently refinanced I had all the necessary paperwork at hand. Elvis Vuong was easy to contact, listened to my concerns and suggestions and kept me regularly informed on the progress of the loan. I would highly recommend doing business with Owning and Elvis Vuong.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had a positive experience with Owning. I did thorough research and Owning offered the best rates. The loan officer and processor were so patient because it was my first time refinancing and they answered all of my 100 questions. They were extremely professional. They had excellent follow through and I was extremely impressed!! I highly recommend Owning for all mortgage needs.<//review>

I had a fabulous experience refinancing with Owning!  Easiest transaction I've ever performed.  Probably took no more than an hour and everything was set.  I'm very pleased with everyone I worked with and the rate I was able to get on my new loan!  Thank you!</text>

We started out cautious in the beginning of our refi since we did not know much about Owing.com. It was not long before we became comfortable dealing with Mark Chang and providing all our information and then Mat Tsai confirming the documentation as accurate and complete. Both individuals performed admirably and provided outstanding service. Within 2 weeks we refinanced out mortgage from a 3.75% loan to a 2.5% APR loan. Thank you Mark and Matt< /Text>

Owning Corporation is a great company to work with.  They were honest and very professional during the entire loan process.   In particular, Nikki Pelzl and Derek Disarro were super efficient and worked well within the time constraints.  They were quick to respond to any and all of my questions and always took the time to explain in detail the on-going loan processes.   I have purchased and refinanced homes numerous times in my career and Owning Corporation is by far the best lending company I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  I recommend them very highly.</text>

Owning delivers! Wow, I was blown away by the speed, efficiency and clear transparency that Owning provided me with my recent refi. The rate was unbelievable (I shopped around; no one could beat it) and the streamlined process, two weeks from start to finish, was absolutely incredible. Paul Manisa was my loan originator. He worked hard to ensure all my documents were uploaded correctly and stayed on top of all my paperwork; he also answered my emails immediately (including Sunday). My loan processor, Annie Lac is absolutely amazing. She made sure all my documents were in order and answered any questions I had throughout this process. Like Paul, she responded quickly to my emails as well. Our title is in a trust so she handled this without a problem. Word is Annie is one of their top loan processors at Owning; I am not shocked! These two make a great team. Even escrow was epic. I received my closing refund check and final closing statement sent overnight via Fedex. The whole process and experience was top notch and I am 110% satisfied. I will most certainly use Owning again if I do another refi. The advertised rate you see on TV is real people. Trust me! Thanks again Owning for a top notch, no nonsense refi. I couldn't be happier.<//text>

<username>Marianne Fullove</username><text>From start to finish, my refinance process with Owning Corporation was streamlined and took only two weeks to close. Phoebe Tran was my loan officer and she and her partner, Gary, were on top of it from the moment I submitted my on-line application. They communicated effectively via email, text, and by telephone. I had to stay on top of it to make sure I gave them what they needed and they got it done! I now have a 15 year mortgage at 2.990% with no out-of-pocket expenses for the exact amount that I owed on my previous loan. I am so happy with Owning and would recommend them for your mortgage needs.< /text></record>

< review>
In January 2020, I took advantage of the low interest rate that Owning Corporation was advertising on television and refinanced my home for free. I completed and closed the process within several weeks. A few months later, the interest rates dropped again and again, I refinanced my home with a different mortgage company. A few weeks after closing with that company, I received a call and email from an Owning representative, loan agent, Tony Mata. He invited me to refinance my home with an even lower interest rate of the previous mortgage company and again, for FREE. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After completing the initial information, and within a couple of days, I received a call and email from the loan processor, Kim Ngueyn. Within 10 days of my initial call from Mr. Mata, Ms. Ngueyn completed and closed my re-fi process. Both representatives were very professional and up front with information. Ms. Nguyen also expressed that the company ever or rarely offer or contact someone personally to ask anyone to re-fi their home and for FREE. Each time we spoke both representatives were very pleasant. I appreciated their professional demeanor while representing Owning Corporation.< /review>

I had great experience refinancing my mortgage recently with Owning. It was a very smooth and fast process. Gregg had done a fantastic job in communicating timely and completing the whole process. The entire Owning team is very proactive unlike my past experiences with other banks/mortgage companies, where I had to follow up on the status often.

I highly recommend Owning for mortgage needs.

The reps are responsive and professional.  The initial process is much simpler than other companies out there (I did shop the loan) and their interest rates are competitive.  We were able to accomplish everything on-line via email and DocuSign - a secure portal for uploading, receiving, and signing documents -  up to the final document signing done in-person with a notary arranged by Owning. If you are looking for a hassle-free mortgage loan process  I highly recommend Owning.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>From beginning to the end, the entire process was flawless and the two gents that helped me with the refi, made the entire process painless. Within a minute of filling out the online application, I was contacted by the account servicer who confirmed the information and worked with the underwriter to close the refi in less than two weeks. Even better was the highly competitive rates that Owning was offering. I was referred to it by a friend and now I've referred several other friends and family members. At the very least, give them a try!<//Review>< resp>

Very smooth process. The time from when we first contacted them to when our loan was funded was only 17 days. Everything was done by phone and online except for signing the final papers with a notary present, which was done in our home. Highly recommended!<//Text>

<Review>Owning was able to handle the refi during the stay at home time like champs. The time from the initial call to completion was only a couple of weeks. They handled everything and kept us up-to-date. They offered a great rate and amazing service.< /Review><rating>5</rating></record>

I refinanced with OWNING because of their advertised rates and they are true to their word.  The entire process from start to finish online was efficient and accurate during these COVID times.  From Trina Macnguyen to Kent Tran their communication and answers to my questions were their strong points.   I even got a lower rate from 2.75% down to 2.625% by the time everything was locked in.
Owning is the most professional loan refinance company I have ever worked with and I wish more companies operated the way that OWNING does.  I was surprised how fast approval, appraisal and funding went through since so many people are refinancing at this time.  At all times I felt comfortable working with people who were at the top of their game with no lag time or delays.
If you're thinking about saving your monthly expense on mortgage, you definitely need to consult  with Owning for their great service and a GREAT RATE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!< /Text>

<Text>My husband and I learned about Owning from ad's on the car radio. They sounded to good to be true. So we checked with other banks and lenders, no one could match what Owning was offering. So we decided to go with Owning. We met with John Nguyen our loan officer, He was great to work with. The whole process took 14 days start to finish.  Something so important that will save you hundreds of dollars every month I highly recommend to everyone!< /Text>< rate>

<Review>Best refi experience!  Emailed Edward on Labor Day weekend expecting to hear something the week after since it was a long weekend. He replied right away and got started on my refi first thing Tuesday morning. Great communication and quick funding.

Aside from the low interest rates, this was the smoothest and quickest refi I’ve ever done! We closed our loan in about 10 days and the old loan was paid off shortly after. Alex Pham and Steve Medici were very responsive and great to work with. I truly do believe that this will be my last refi!<//Text>

Refinanced my home with Owning in about 2.5 weeks with good interest rate.  Very satisfied with the over all process and services.  Had a wonderful experience working with Joshua H (Loan Office) And Nikki P (Loan Processor).  They were great to work.  They answered my questions and concerns.  Very friendly and professional people!!!  Recommend Owning to anyone who wants to refinance their home.<//review>

I was skeptical about the 2.625% rate & APR advertised on tv but I went to the website anyway and filled up the forms.  Immediately afterwards, I got a call.  Again, I asked for the rate and I was assured that the rate and APR
would be 2.625. I was still doubtful.  So, I was informed that I would get an e-mail that would state the rate and APR of 2.625. I finally agreed and was told  my loan will close in three (3) weeks.  True enough, my loan got funded in three weeks. There were very few documents required from me. My loan was done expeditiously.

I highly recommend Owning Corporation for your loan needs.

<Text>Jorge and Julie were fast and smooth to help me close on a refi within 3 weeks.  They were both very patient to answer all my questions as well.
Excellent experience especially with the time of COVID-19, everything was done electronically except for closing where the notary came to my house for signing closing papers.  This is expected though.  However, the notary had only 2 years of experience, so was not able to answer a lot of my questions.</Text><rating>4< /rating>< Pictures>

< Review>
Best Rate, super fast processing and excellent customer service.

To me Michael Lamour and Steven Medici are faces of owning.com. They both made sure to keep me informed proactively at each step of the process. This was the fastest closure I have experienced yet. It was all done within 20 days from start to funding.
Micheal was the first mortgage broker who voluntarily tried to explain in detail the loan estimate document , no other broker has done this before in my experience. He really cares about educating the customer and not just closing an account. He always responded in time though I knew he was super busy.

I got the best rate and fastest service..< /Review>

<Review>One of the easiest and fastest refinancing that I have ever done. If you have an interest rate over 3.50%, what are you waiting for? Every month, you could be saving money!!

Brooks was accessible throughout the process (I called 3 times to have him clarify questions we had). I did not feel rushed in our conversations, he took his time on our calls and was able to simplify answers to the novice. Michelle (loan processor) kept us informed every step of the way and also was quick to reply to questions we had. I have already referred Owning to friends. All around a great experience.</Text>< pictures>

Everything went as smooth as it could be because of their hard work.  Bradley contact me minutes after I inquired online and Phuong Dao was available for emails and returned my phone calls promptly even after office hours and on weekends to fast track my paperworks such that the whole process took less than 3 weeks.
You made my refinance a breeze. Definitely highly recommended! Keep up the great work!

i recently completed a refi with the Owning Corp. and was very impressed with the entire process. My agent, Tony Buesing, and processor, Christine Huong, were outstanding throughout and that included a significant hurdle that was rapidly resolved thanks to their skills and communication with the underwriter. Beyond that, the rate that I got from the Owning Corp. was better than any other that i could find after a thorough search of the internet.<//Text>

<review>We had a 3.75 fixed 30 year loan.  Due to the rates coming down, I reached out to my trusted refi person that I've used for years.  My wife commented she heard on the radio a company named Owning.  I decided to call and spoke with John Quezada.  He is a funny guy and we had a great time laughing about things.

Bottom line, he got us a 15 year fixed 2.5%, no closing costs and the loan process took just under 2 weeks.  No drama, just good underwriters who see the big picture.

I'm glad John and I talked.  Great experience, quick and I will recommend to all of my friends.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Both William (Loan Originator) and Laura (Loan Processor) did a fantastic job on my refinance. William was always available immediately for all my questions and went the extra mile; for example, he filled out the application for me and just had me verify / sign rather than having to print it out, scan it, email it. Laura had my back for every situation; from reaching out to the appraisal company hourly, to getting an exemption from her manager to exclude property taxes as part of the closing costs even though they are due in a month.

All documents that were time sensitive were sent as sign-online. The icing on the cake was that, as advertised, they paid for all closing costs including the appraisal. My refinance took about 15 days and there were no surprises.

Thank you William, Laura, and Owning!<//Review>< user>

Awesome experience with OWNING.  They made the re-finace process super easy.  Chris and Iman were extremely helpful, pleasant and professional.  They took care of everything from A to Z.  I couldn't ask for better service.  My sister referred me and our other sister also refinanced through OWNING from our recommendation.  100% satisfied.<//Review>

<Review>I recently opened a loan with owning my agent was great, but after I sent my required documents I heard nothing for two days so I called, The agent informed me that they are not doing appraisals at this time, (why do I need an appraisal for a simple refry no money out?) he said we can submit your loan when things get back to normal, is that days, is that weeks, is that months?</Review>< time>

Albert and Michelle did a wonderful job getting my refinancing processed. Albert knew that  rate could changed so he locked in the rate good for 30 days. Then Michelle worked with my creditors to make sure that is smooth and keeping me updated along the way.  My loan closed in less than 30 days.

Great job Owning team.

Owning is the reason why homeowners are Winning! They truly practice what they preach and are a blessing to the mortgage industry. They have the best process in the industry which all homeowners deserve to experience. Fast process, great customer service and the best rates available. My processor Kimberly Tran is the best processor in the industry! She treated my refinance as if she was refinancing her own home. Justin Hoang my loan officer was very informative and professional throughout the process. Owning should be the first place you look to for a home refinance! A+< /review>

This was the best refinancing experience by far. The website interface was simple and straightforward. They were continuously responsive and answered every question we had. Having worked with other lenders over the years, we were skeptical about Owning's "no cost" loan claim, but they really do me "no cost". Michelle, our loan processor, was amazing to work with. She made sure everything went smoothly and we closed the loan in less than 20 days! We would recommend Owning Corp to everyone.<//text>

When I heard the Owning advertisement on the radio I had my doubts on whether the "zero closing costs" was true and it is. Michelle and Nguyen provided excellent customer service from start to finish. The Owning Team definitely exceeded my expectations. I will be recommending to Family and Friends.< /review>

Quick and easy, should be they're model, great service and knowledgeable staff made my refinance a breeze and everything by email, didn't have to step in any office,

I had a wonderful experience with Mr. Robert Nguyen and Ms. Nikkie Pelzl. The loan process was quick and easy. They funded my loan in 17 days. The rate was good, no closing costs, and no appraisal.

I updated the rating to 1 star on 8/1/2020 because I was not really satisfy with the company after the loan has funded. I contacted the company on 7/14/2020 for instructions on how to make the first payment but I received no response from the payment team. I learned how to make the 1st payment (due 8/1/2020) via google search engine and mailed the payment on 7/21/2020. On 7/28/2020, I contacted Owning to make sure they have received my check and again I got no response from them. Thanks to Robert, he helped me follow up with the payment team and I finally received my confirmation on 7/31/2020. I thanked them for their help but again received no response from them. I guess they are busy.

I updated the rating to 5 stars today 8/3/2020 because now they do followed up email and phone call to let me know they have received my payment on 7/23/2020.</Review>

Based on a scale of 1-5 (5-being the best), and my limited experience with Owning Corp. and their representatives, I would consider a "4.0" to be moderate.   With regards to my overall experience, I would say a "4.2” is being somewhat generous.  The reason is that I had to adjust my schedule to accommodate a second notary because the first one did a poor job.  Nevertheless, the loan officer, and loan processor were in constant contact with me throughout the whole ordeal.  Thanks for the communication which is key in every business.< /Review>

Our initial contact with Owning was great.  Their rep, Tom was nothing short of exceptional.  Then it all fell apart at closing. That rep was at best functional, and at the very least robotic and matter-of-fact, with no sense of professional business etiquette.  Was the entire Re-fi process efficient otherwise?  Absolutely!< /Review>

<Review>We started the refi process on Sept 16th, signed papers on the 24th and saw everything wrap up on the 14th of October. Richard Komant and Ana Nguyen were wonderful. Ana kept us updated and answered any questions quickly and even responded on weekends which was unexpected and not necessary but very much appreciated.

The most difficult part was getting the notary process worked out with the signing occurring in our home. After everything was done Owning proactively reached out to us to ensure that everything was taken care of and that we did not have any additional questions. Danny was great here as well, overall a good experience. Rates are low so it was a no-brainer to jump in.</Review><gmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>The great thing about refinancing through Owning was the speed of the re-fi.  It took two weeks from beginning to end, the fastest I have ever done a re-fi.  everything went exactly as promised, no hidden fees or problems.  My initial contact Brandon was courteous and professional on the phone.  My loan processor Edgar always responded quickly to my emails even if it was late at night.
So why not 5 stars?  Two reasons.  The escrow company used by Owning is Lenders Choice Escrow.  It was disclosed in the documents I signed at closing that Lenders Choice Escrow is owned or affiliated with Owning.com.  I think that escrow companies should be independent third parties separate from lender or borrower.  Second reason: It was sometimes hard to get the people at Owning on the phone for a voice conversation...although as I have said above my emails were always responded to promptly.
Summary:  Would I recommend Owning.com?  Yes, definitely.  I have already recommended them to some of my friends.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Having gone through 4 previous home purchases and refinancing experiences in the past, this has been by far the most easiest, pleasant, and most professional transaction that I have ever experienced.  The Owning Corporation TEAM of Joe Tejeda and Edgar Moreno were incredible, extremely responsive, and were always available to assist me.  They provided me the best deal that could not be matched by any of the Top 5 national lenders and by any other mortgage brokers.  I will definitely recommend Owning Corporation and will continue to use them for all of my future home purchase and refinancing opportunities.  Owning is a Stellar 5+ Star rated company!!!  Thank you Joe and Edgar!!!<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Very fast, organized, and clear refinancing process. Got to lower my interest rate with no processing fees and other 3rd party fees as mentioned in the disclosure. Only had to pay for the pro-rated interest, impound (home insurance and property tax). New loan is pre-funded and still waiting for my previous loan to close.

I was referred to owning by a family member raving about their ability to process his refinance request. My experience was excellent, as well. Great processes in place. Ability to communicate effectively with customers is excellent. I am excited about my future financial outlook thanks to owning providing me with a historically low rate and bringing me from 30 years down to 15. Honestly, the easiest transaction I’ve ever been a part of.</text>

We closed and I was funded in under 30 days with nothing out of pocket.  It was the easiest refi I've ever done.  Derek and Nikki were awesome.  Great contact with them throughout the whole process and we didn't encounter a single bump.  I would highly recommend Owning if you're looking to refi your home.  Job well done.</review>

Very simple process to refi with Owning. All the paperwork is done electronically, except final signing with a Notary. Their advertised rates are not necessarily what you will get unless you meet the required LTV and principal balance, but it should be close.

After trying to refinance my mortgage through my current lender and experiencing nothing but frustration, a friend suggested I try Owning. Boy am I glad I did!! My experience with Owning was nothing but wonderful. Their customer service was fantastic, and they matched the rate my current lender was offering me---only without any closing costs or the upfront appraisal fee my current lender was going to charge me. They requested a minimal amount of documents from me. The whole process was seamless, smooth, and almost too good to be true!!<//Text>

I had a great refinance experience with Owning!  Nguyen Thantrong and Madelyn Nguyen were both amazing.  They were very informative and helpful during the process.  Owning made the refi process easy and FAST.  I got the best rate plus paid $0 in closing costs....something that the other lenders would not offer.  I closed in less than 14 days from submitting my paperwork and application.  I've already referred several family member and co-workers.  If you're thinking about buying or refinancing, go with Owning!< /review>

Excellent service and the best experience provided by Owning.com. All the terms are black and white and clear, no hidden gimmicks or cost. I had locked the rate at higher rate but as the rate dropped before the closing Hong locked at lower rate which I haven't seen in more than 50 refi I have done across multiple houses. Wish I would have known them earlier.<//review>

< Review>
Owning Corp came to our rescue.  We were looking to refinance our rental property, as quickly as possible, as we needed the funds for our small business - time was of the essence.  After starting a refinance process with a Credit Union that was taking weeks to just process the first set of documents; a colleague referred us to Owning.   They had processed their refinance within 14 days. So we called Owning and started the process with John M & Vivien. To our amazement, we were signed and funded within 15 days.

The process was smooth and easy - with minimal paperwork and great communication from both John and Vivien along the way. Owning Corp has truly mastered this process and we highly recommend them to all our family and friends.  You will not be disappointed.  We are also planning to refinance our primary residence with Owning soon.</Review>

Brilliant! Mortgage refi went thru in super quick time. All staff involved were helpful and well informed. I would recommend Owning Corp to anyone looking to refi. Its a pity the BIG banks aren't so efficient and helpful.

Special thanks to Nikki Pelzl, Jeremiah Gillman and our notary.< /Text>

<text>I decided to do my refi through Owning after reading the reviews, yet I admit to being skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly it went and how fast. Timothy and Gary were very knowledgeable and responsive to my needs. Emails and phone calls were returned quickly. It took less than two weeks from start to finish. The documents required were minimal and I didn’t have to have an inspection.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this company to anyone and I would definitely work with them again.<//text>< Pictures>

Fastest, easiest, cheapest, best Refi ever. I had recently refinanced my mortgage with my original bank, and it took about 6 weeks for everything to go through. A few days later I found out about Owning, and the rate was 0.5 point better, so I went for it. So glad I did. Sent in my required paperwork, which was minimal, and then the rest was all Docusign until the actual Closing. Took less than 3 weeks. Everyone I worked with at Owning was very professional, knowledgeable, and responsive. I've already told multiple friends about it, and a couple are now in the process to refinance their loans.<//review>

I was looking to refinance my house and saw Owning on TV and was very skeptical about their ads, thinking it was too good to be true.  However, I called them and I must say that I had a very positive experience.  They were fast, efficient, and provided a very good rate. In addition, they provided honest answers (even if it did not benefit them) and allowed me to make intelligent decisions about my financial loan planning. I received a loan within 19 days (13 working days).  They paid for all of the refinancing costs. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for refinancing.< /review>

<text>My loan officer from Owning, Brooks Lamb, along with Tiffany my processor, were efficient, did what they said they were going to do, answered every question, no matter how insignificant, and the loan closed so quickly I was shocked! I have never had such a great experience. Also, I got the best deal anywhere, trust me,  I shopped around. The common response was, "How could they offer you that?"< /text><userid>101529218793257023807<//userid>< name>

I have never quite had such an amazing experience as this one with Owning. It was super fast and easy with zero red tape or delays. I’m sure they are extremely busy with rates as low as they are but I was always taken care of and my questions and concerns were always answered. Many thanks to Masa Omura and Julie Kim.

Thanks again to Owning and I wish more company’s would do business like you guys.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I had a really positive experience overall with Owning.com. The whole process to close once I initiated the credit check took less than a month, and it only took longer because I was out of town and not there when the appraisal was scheduled, otherwise they're extremely responsive and seems to be working around the clock.

One feedback and tip I have was to double check and call your Loan Processing Officer to make sure that if you need to wire transfer them money that the information about the wire transfer is accurate and sent securely (aka not just via email on a pdf).< /text>< pics>

<Text>We worked with Hai Nguyen to refinance our mortgage and were very pleased by the service. Not only the rate he offered is competitive, Hai is very communicative, patient and transparent through out the whole process. The 100% online process makes things easy especially during the pandemic. We're so glad that our neighbor referred us to Owning and have been telling our friends about it. If you're thinking about saving your monthly expense on mortgage, you definitely need to reach out to Hai at Owning. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I was in the re-fi process with 4 other companies and after six weeks of back and forth emails and endless requests for documentation, I saw a commercial for Owning at 9:30pm and I called and connected with Mike Valdez. Mike, you are awesome!!! Thank you for making this process smooth and quick. From 1 conversation with Mike, I submitted him my documents and the very next day, Loan Processor Tiffany Ramirez contacted me and took care of the rest. The entire process took 11 days. 11 Days!!!! : )   Thank you Mike and Tiffany and the team at Owning for helping me save $300 per month and get the best rate possible.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I hadn't used Owning before but did some research and decided to apply for a refinance.  The process was incredibly easy and quick.  Signed documents inside 2 weeks from first speaking with them.  The deal was as advertised, great rate and no fees.  Very happy I used them.< /Review>

<username>Mukesh Mansukhani</username><text>I am very happy with my experience with Owning.  In December of 2019 I spoke to George of Owning corporation and told him I was considering a refi.  George asked me what I wanted and I gave him my requirement for the amount of money I wanted to save monthly.   With the rates at that time, George said that he could not meet my requirements,
but said he would call back if he could.  One month later George called me back and informed me that the rates had dropped and he could meet my requirements.  I appreciate George's honesty and professionalism.   The same goes for my loan processor Joshua. Joshua was on top of the paperwork. The process was very easy. I was never pressured and never had to go out of my way. Thank you Owning.<//text><resp>{'time': 1583774630567, 'text': 'Thank you for the amazing review and shout outs, Mukesh!'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Easiest refi ever! I applied online, spoke with Pat the initial rep, for 5 minutes on the phone. The Lena took over, and everything was able to be done online. Documents uploaded easily, emails from them were easily accessed, no appraisal fee, no costs to me. We closed in under 3 weeks. They were amazing, and prior to this I had refi'd with a costco lender who I thought was great, but this blew them out of the water.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1597098125122, 'text': 'Thanks for the amazing review Gale, it was a pleasure working with you!'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402</Gmap_id></record>

Working with Owning was great! Michael DiSarro was attentive and efficient. He was able to answer all my questions. The rate, costs and process was straightforward and consistent. Shenea Nellum was able to process the loan documents and other required tasks quickly and easily. The entire process was extremely quick, contacted Owning on 7/26/2020 and my loan funded 8/11/2020.</Text>

I contacted Owning to refinance my house. Everyone I dealt with was very helpful in explaining the process and everything I needed. They answered my questions in a timely manner. The process from application to closing was fast. The appraisal was scheduled quickly. Someone came to my house for my document signing.

<review>Excellent service, very kind and dedicated staff. I just wish the "free closing fees" is a truly free,  they don't pay for the recording fees and any other fees (not to confuse with interests that need to be paid) charged by the bank where the refinanced mortgage balance is paid off (in my case Chase bank).  Overall a very positive experience.  Thank you.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>From start to end, no stress. Owning ‘a Frank Daker made me feel he was out to look for my best interest.  The processor, Joshua Esguerra was very informative of what was needed till the end.   Amerisave was charging me 7k for same loan rate, Owning gave me same rate with no cost to me without knowing I dealing with another lender.  You get was you see on their website.   I got the lowest rate without me buying any points.  Thank you Owning for saving me from paying thousands.  I recommend them 100%

I was a fairly easy case, but after my initial online submission, I received a call within minutes, and loan approval in just a couple hours. Closing was done in 17 days at a great rate - and truly at no cost for all the normal re-fi fees. Great experience.<//Review>

We really appreciate how quickly they refinanced our mortgage. The whole team was easy to work with and very professional through the entire process.

The only reason we’re not giving them five stars is because the interest rate was .75% higher than the advertised rate. We were told this was because our home is a condominium. We’ve owned condo’s since 1997 and have never been charged a higher rate because of it. That being said, we did end up with a lower rate, just not as low as we had hoped.</Review>
<pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1582138263839, 'text': 'Thanks for sharing your honest feedback, Barbara. We understand your frustration. With condos, it’s a matter of pricing in the risk of community-living structures as well. There are simply a lot of things that impact the value of the property that are unfortunately out of the control of a single-unit owner. Please do not hesitate to give us a call should you have any more questions or concerns. Transparency is very important to us, and we are happy to walk you through all of our processes!'}< /response>< GmapID>

Low refi rate (if your loan falls within the very narrow range of the fine print) and no non-recurring costs are the great part. After sending the loan officer a check for thousands with the assurance the loan was funding that afternoon, two weeks later I got a late payment letter and found out that the old loan had not been paid off. I called, texted, and left voicemail to the loan agent and loan officer and got no response after waiting for 2 days. Then I called their 866 number and got a recording that the number was no longer in service. I went back to their website and opened a chat with an agent and asked if she could get a message to my loan officer to call me. She said she would, but I got no call back, waiting another day, also still calling my loan agent and loan officer and going straight to voicemail and no call back. Finally called the local office general number and my loan agent picked up, surprised that I had reached him! (Had they been screening out my calls the entire time?) I asked my loan status and he said the loan was funded. I asked what "funded" means when my old loan had not been paid off 2 weeks ago. He hung up! Weeks later the loan closed. Worst refi experience in 30 years. VP called later and said they would maybe send me a couple hundred bucks for my bad experience. I thanked him, and promised I would write this review. I guess they decided maybe they wouldn't send the bucks after all. Cheers! (The Customer Success department is a misnomer.)<//review>< pictures>

<text>On the very first call, our loan originator, Michael Lamour, gave me his cell phone number and told me to call him with any questions at any time.  I called him on a Saturday night at 8:30 PM so I know he is true to his word.  The entire process was super fast, with no-nonsense.  Our refinance was complete, with our other lender paid off, just 18 days after our first contact with Owning and 16 days (including the Memorial Day holiday) after our application was complete.  I have the highest recommendation for Owning, specifically Michael Lamour and Van Tran, our loan processor.< /text>< UserId.>

<text>I couldn't believe how fast, efficient, friendly, and cheap Owning was for our refinance.  Our previous lender was competing as hard as they could to retain our business, but the best they could come up with was over $8k in fees (after a $5k credit).  I'm telling everyone I know they should refinance through Owning.

Working with Hanh, who shepherded us through the process, was a joy.  She was quick to respond, any time, day or night.  She went out of her way to make sure everything was ready ahead of time.

I've had a number of mortgages, both new and refinances.  Never once has any been so simple.  Unlike my previous company, there were no surprises at the last minute.

Thank you, Owning!  Thank you, Hanh!<//text>< GmapID>

Our experience with Owning was very easy going and simple. They really guided us through every step, making us feel comfortable with entire process. And now thanks to them, we locked in a rate that is about 1.5% less than our previous APR. Thank you for all of your help!</Text>

Owning's refinance interest rates were the lowest available anywhere, and there were no closing costs; and in our case, no appraisal was necessary.

We refinanced our home on January 2020 with Owning, our loan officer was Hai Nguyen, we had a very positive experience with them and we decided to refinance again this year with Owning. Their rates were the best in the market and our loan officer again was Hai Nguyen and again working with him was an absolute pleasure. He very clearly explained us the costs, rates and fees, and how they are practically nonexistent. Then our loan processor Tiffany Ramirez processed our loan in a very fast and efficient manner. She found a couple of issues with the information we provided and thanks to Tiffany we able to solve them on timely manner.
I saw a few negative reviews on Owning while writing this review and was very surprised. I strongly recommend Owning corporation and want to thank again Hai and Tiffany for a very pleasant refinancing process.</Text>

I've completed two refinances with Owning in the past eight months and both were by far the easiest mortgage transactions I've completed over the years. Owning's staff were professional, efficient, and friendly to work with.  Owning honored the terms they quoted and completed both loans in about two weeks, with minimal paperwork and effort from me.  I'm a very happy customer.< /Review>

Darren was very helpful in the initial phases of the refinance and handed me over to Hanh.  They both were essential in expediting the process.  In addition, Hanh went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable with the funding process.<//Text>

Worked with Ron Piri and Marialena Dufour. Both were excellent and extremely responsive. Ron took all the info on the phone on the first day and filled out the application very accurately. He was very responsive with my many questions and gave accurate information.
Lena was also extremely efficient. She worked late to get my papers ready for underwriting and processing. She was there to answer all questions during the process and arrange for the notary etc.
Loan closed and funded within the promised timeframe in 3 weeks.Overall a very good refinance experience.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>I refinanced my mortgage with Owning after shopping around with other services like Better. Owning's rates and closing costs (or lack thereof) were significantly better than the competition. Better even has a price guarantee, but they still couldn't meet or beat Better's rates.

I also like how simple Owning's pricing structure is. There's just one rate, no closing costs, and it's clearly displayed on the homepage. However, I can see how this lack of options can be problematic for those looking to cash-out refi or secure jumbo loans.

Their service was excellent. Owning was in regular communication with me to make sure the refi process was moving along smoothly. The time to closing the refinance was also very quick, approximately three weeks from the day I submitted my application.

The main drawback of Owning is their lack of digital tooling, likely due to being a relatively new company. Digital competitors like Better are light years ahead in providing online services. Owning's application is done via PDF attachments sent over email. They have a way's to go in leveraging online forms, digital signatures, online application status, and other self-service tools. I imagine they'll add these features as the company grows.

A couple minor quibbles. One, an Owning rep kept pestering me to write an online review. I told them I wanted to wait until I saw confirmation that my previous mortgage was paid off, but she continued to send me emails. The rep even had the audacity to send me a canned positive review to "copy and paste" on Google Reviews. Not classy at all.

Secondly, since they paid the first installment for the new mortgage, I sent my first payment to Owning via check (no online payments). A few weeks later, they called asking if I had sent payment, and I indicated yes. They waited a few days then said they hadn't received payment and requested I re-send payment, which I did. A few days later, they cashed my first check which I sent weeks ago. I had to stop payment on the second check I mailed. This wasn't a big deal, but easily avoidable if they had online payments with email confirmations.

I'm giving Owning four stars. I'd happily recommend them to others. To stay competitive with this new wave of online real estate tech, they need to build out their digital tools, but they're on the right track.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I worked with Veronica and Steve, they are both knowledgeable and helpful with our home refinancing needs. We wanted a lower interest rate and Veronica came through and provided that. She fought for our business and I liked that. Steve also was professional and informative with all our questions and they responded in a timely manner. I would recommend this company to others.</Text>

I like staff who are knowledgeable, do not push sales, provide straight forward information, like their job, and believe that their customers are not dumb. I found all these qualities in Jeff Johnson who helped me start the loan process.  I had talked to Jeff six months ago and our conversation was just like talking to a friend and he gave me good advice regarding my loans.  I happened to call Jeff again in early March 2020 for a possible refi and he gave me an excellent interest rate and made the process really swift.  Micheal Johnson sent me the loan docs and was nice and friendly.  My loan was funded in 10 calendar days and Jeff and Micheal answered all my questions by text or by phone call in a matter of minutes and made my refi a great experience.< /Text>

Hands down the best experience with a real estate loan company I have ever had.  They did exactly what they said... the "no cost" loan was actually a no cost loan, the rate was exactly as stated at the beginning, and the agent and processor assigned to our file were outstanding.  I can absolutely, positively recommend this company to anyone looking to refinance.  From the first conversation to close of escrow was 15 days, amazing!< /Text>

<Review>From our initial inquiry phone call to Anthony Morgan, Mortgage Loan Originator at Owning, it only took 2 weeks to close our refinance! No major bank would have been able to do this and no one else came close to the rates they were offering. I was very skeptical about the no fees no closing cost claims by Owning, but I can confirm that this is indeed the truth. I was very impressed with the responsiveness of Anthony along with our Loan Processor Tania Rueben. Every step of the refinance went off without a hitch. I was also impressed with the Notary Kelvin  Driscoll that came to our house to notarize and sign the final paperwork. All in all, I would highly recommend Owning!<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< response>

Wow!wow!wow! This is an amazing and efficient company to refinance your home. The open communication and the whole process is something that as a homeowner I had NEVER experienced. Our Mortgage agent was Alre Halim. His attention to detail was impeccable. He explained All the paperwork thoroughly and paused to ask if I had any questions or if it all made sense. I immediately felt I was in good hands. Alre gave the name of our Processor Kim Troung and said that I would be dealing with both. Kim Troung was very polite and communicative and the response time was top notch. This company deserves more than 5 stars the whole process took less than a month and we are so happy and pleased with our new rate. Thank you Owning.com for hiring AMAZING people that make refinancing process painless. Will highly recommend to family and friends and anyone who reads reviews.<//text>

<text>I had an amazing experience with owning company. Not only did they help me refinance when no one could or wanted to, my loan processor Kim Tran went above and beyond to assist me. Even when my escrow officer who works for my condo community kept dodging things and not doing her job, Kim was there to pick up slack that wasn’t even her job in the first place. I’m very happy with Kim and my experience with Owning. Definitely have been referring them to my friends and family and will be working with them in the future.< /text><rating>5</rating>< user>

Owning provided the smoothest refi transaction I have ever encountered. The entire process from the initial inquiry to signing papers took only 2 weeks, and there were no surprises. Our loan processor (Kim) was professionally responsive to questions and moved the process forward with amazing efficiency.< /text>

I got no surprises, they delivered as they promised from the beginning. Plus, once I inquired with them, got tons of solicitations by mail and phone and none could beat them (I'm a good borrower though :-)). I do recommend them.<//Text>< pics>

This is absolutely by far the best lender I have ever dealt with and I consider myself a seasoned refinancer.

Owning has been amazing, from the communication of the first person to the last person. Ashley and Lisa have been amazing. I have bought 3 home loans in my time and over 6 refinances and never have I encountered a lender quite like Owning. Like I mentioned, communication, followup and the amazing speed of closing.... I cant say how impressed I am. I have definitely vaulted owning as my #1 lender.

Thank you so much Lisa and Ashley and everyone involved in making me feel like I was your only Loan.</text>

The refi process was super easy, the Loan Officer and Processor make sure they got everything they need from me the first time round and funded the loan in no time. I refi several times in the past couple of years for multiple properties, and I have to say this was the easiest and most stress free experience I had.</review>

<Text>Fast and no hassle experience. I don't think that Owning is the actual lender owning your loan, but will be transferred to a bank that they are in contract with. So from my experience they are acting as a broker.<//Text><date>1591914123777<//date></record>

<review>Kelly Hoffman, my loan processor was the absolute best. My experience started off shaky with another processor; which prompted a switch to Kelly. Boy was I happy to be reassigned. Kelly started off with hearing my concerns and assured me that she would make my experience her priority and she did just that. She immediately went to work reviewing my file and pushing things forward. Her communication with me about the status of my loan was always on time. From beginning to the end, she   went above and beyond making sure my experience as a Owning client was exceptional. She single handedly saved the deal and made me happy to give this heartfelt review. Thank you Kelly!</review><Date>1566366698440< /Date>< response>

I appreciated Owning's helpful approach, and no pressured sales. Mike Diaz was available and responsive in getting my application submitted. I also appreciated his support in getting the best rate available. Also in pulling all my documents together for closing, my loan processor was very communicative and I appreciated him keeping me in the loop. Thanks to Dominique, I closed earlier than expected and things went smoothly.</Review>

<review>Just completed my home refinance with Owning Corporation.  It was the easiest and quickest refinance process that I've experienced.  From start to finish the entire process took only 2 weeks.  Simply amazing.  The best part is that I got an amazing RATE with No Closing Costs!

I worked with John Martinez and Michelle Huynh.  Both were wonderful to work with.  They made the entire process simple, fast, efficient, and user friendly.  Both John and Michelle always kept me informed of status.  Whenever I had questions, I simply sent an email and my questions were answered within minutes.

I highly recommend Owning Corporation for all of your mortgage and home buying/selling needs.  Check them out and you won't regret the decision.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Wanted to Re-finance my Home that I purchased in 2018 because interest rate had dropped, so first called My Broker I went through & he had made $7600 on that deal so thought he would make me a good deal since he knew me. Wrong was going to charge me $4600 I had lots of calls as most people know once you get on-line looking but Owning was not pushy but gave the straight up facts better interest rate by far everything was done so fast & I have to say when I had a Question I would text & I got a responce immediately. No closing cost which I am  still in complete amazement since my Broker & others said Nobody does that.. Well guess what Owning does that. Big Thank you to Vickie & Iman who got everything done & closed so fast.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I had a great and fast refinance process experience with Owning by the fully satisfied help from Robert Nguyen and Julie Pan. On Jan 11 2020 at 10:30pm, I submitted refinance application on the owning website once I watched the ad on KCAL9. Robert in that night sent me the required documents list. At the second day morning, I provided all the documents, and Robert quickly locked in the rate. So efficiently! then Julie helped us prepare all the files for closing. This loan just closed on Jan 29th 2020. it only took about 18 days from application to closing.  Whole process goes very smoothly, and quickly. What's more, we got the best rate. At the same time, I also contacted the other two refinance lenders, both of them offered higher rates with much higher closing cost. Owning not only gives us lowest rate, but also provide the lender credit to cover the closing cost. So happy with their service. I will recommend their work. I will continue to use their service for the next real estate purchasing. Thanks a lot and appreciate all the help from them.</Review>

<Review>Brooks Lamb is the best loan officer i have encountered. He was very professional and ‘lightning speed‘.  You wont find it anywhere else as fas as this guy, trust me.
The only hiccup in my experience was escrow. Their escrow sucks. Granted they are busy due to supper agent like Brooks bringing 100s or loans.  I think they need to really improve the escrow department.
I give 5 stars since Daniel Mota promised that he will convey my feedback to escrow people. No matter how busy you are pick up the phone or call back.
Thank you Brooks & Owning! :)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1592868048905, 'text': "Thanks for the great rating Ari! We're sorry your escrow experience wasn't up to our high standards, but we are always working to improve and your feedback is appreciated. Thanks again!"}</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>I refinanced with Owning and I am overall pleased with the deal and transaction.

1- Staff was very friendly and dynamic. They indeed know what they were doing.

I contacted owning via the company website chat and 2 days latter I decided to give them my business fully on-line. I sent all the requested documents and by the end of the week we scheduled to close the deal.

They were also able to accommodate a special request to come to my home for notary.

My previous experience with Lender was very frustrating, they advertise you a low rate to get you in a deal with them and then when you are in escrow they ended up locking you in a higher rate and you have a tight deadline to close the deal and ends up with no alternative rather than accept.

With Owing was different, I told them straight ahead that I would not refinance if the rate was higher than the advertised and they fully honored what they advertised - 2.99% APR for 15 years.

2- The only downside that I had was that I have to refinance more than I wanted in order to get the rate that they offered me. Not a big deal since I could repay with no penalty at any time.

Very Pleasant staff, I would indeed work with them again.<//text></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I refinanced our home mortgage loan through Owning Corporation and I must say the process went extremely smooth, and quick!! We worked with Jesse and Casey, and they were knowledgeable, helpful, thorough, and had pleasant personalities. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Big thanks!!!</Review>

Refinancing with owning corporation was easy and stress free. Requires very few documents for proof of income and taxes compare to other landers. I was given the best interest rate possible for my loan amount thanks to Manager Kelly. She was very courteous, helpful and professional. She did excellent job for me. I really appreciate all her help.
I also worked with Rick and he did good job too, He was quick and responding to my calls. I think Owning corporation has the lowest rate compare to other landers. Overall I was very satisfied with Owning corporation, I will recommend my family and friends to Owning corporation.
Thanks you

<review>I looked at three different companies for my refi.   Owning was the first and was upfront with their offer.   The second two not so much.   In fact one went from zero cost refi to almost $8000 in costs when they sent the rate lock offer ro sign.   I received the lowest APR, and no cost refi with Owning.   The process was easy, entirely online, and took about two weeks.   I highly recommend Owning!</review><name>Jim Seleno< /name></record></dataset><record>

Wow! This was my fastest and easiest refi I’ve ever done at the best rate I’ve ever had! I did my research on Owning including their website, reviews, and the BBB. I was skeptical at first. I’ve been watching the Owning television commercials for at least six months. Finally, the rate dropped to a full point below my previous mortgage (for homes with at least 50% equity). It was the right time to go for it!
George took my application over the phone, and he sent me a copy of the documents electronically to review. I emailed my supporting documents, and Racquel and team took care of the rest! I received an email from my previous bank the day after closing that the previous loan had been paid in full. Owning even followed up the next day to answer any questions and check on my satisfaction with the whole process. I’m very happy!</review>

I am very happy with my experience getting a loan with Owning. Outstanding service. Karen Castro and Steve Medici are so awesome. They help me all the way. Updating me with the status of my application everyday. It took less than 2 weeks to process and fund my loan. I am referring them to friends and family who are thinking of refinancing  their home.
Karen and Steve I will be forever grateful for your help. The money I save monthly will fund my planned yearly vacation.< /Review>

This is the first time we've ever had such great services from beginning to the end for our refi with Owning Corp. Ciro and Martin were so professional and helpful in every way. Our loan was closed in less than 2 weeks and the paperwork process was stress-free and smooth compared to the previous 4 times that we refi with other lenders. Immediately referred our sister and she also got hers done under 21 days.  What an amazing team!</Review>

From the moment Karen Castro answered the phone, the service was amazing. When I say my refinance was free, I don't mean I just rolled the fees into the loan or took cash out to cover the costs, I mean it was 100% FREE! Owning covered all my fees and had my loan processed and funded in 15 days. This was the easiest and fastest process I have ever done. I have recommended them to all of my coworkers.  5 stars!</Text>< user_name>

<text>Excellent Service
This is by far the fastest and easiest refinance I have ever experienced.  I was hesitant at first, "Too good to be true" as what they say, but I can attest to that through my own experience that Owning delivers the promise of No Fee loan. John Aceves and Tiffany Ramirez  are very professional  and did an awesome job! Highy recommend this company.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1582589975385, 'text': 'Thanks for the amazing review and shout outs, Nadia!

Owning performed my ReFi better than any other company I have used in the past 20 years.  I started with another loan company, Loan Depot.  They were dragging on and on and showed no motivation after we completed all the online forms to their satisfaction.   Owing offered us .25% lower interest rate and was very professional.  KL< /text>

There were no hidden fees to me in my no cost refinance and everything was explained well to me by them.  I highly recommend Owning if your looking to get either a new loan or refinance done. They also had the lowest rates around when I shopped my refinance.</review>< pics>

David Moc/Irene Bang provided excellent support locked in at the rate advertised in website, also allowed me to have no impound account for the new loan which usually can cost another basis point, and closing done in 2 weeks. Loan got funded and previous lender got payoff same day after recess period. There was no closing cost I had to pay for the transaction (other than of course the pre-paid interest for the new loan and the previous lender payoff fee). Owning took care of all other closing costs. Thank you.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /gmap_id>< user>

He is professional, knowledgeable, informative, quick at responding, readily available at any time day or night, and a courteous individual.  He follows up with you and ensures that you understand every process that you're going through within your refinance process . He made my refinance quick and easy with his dedication and hard work. I will definitely recommend and refer others to Hai and Owning for any refinancing assistance.  If your looking into refinancing you need to give Hai Nguyen from Owning a call.  He will take great care of you.</text>< pics>

I just want to extend my sincere appreciation to your team for completing my loan. The level of professionalism from Jesse Kuet and Tracy Wheeler was second to none.

I sincerely appreciate your help and greatly impressed by their level of commitment. I am very pleased.

Thanks to the entire Owning Family!</Review>

<review>I have to admit this was the easiest and fastest refi I have ever experienced. It only took 15days from my call to Tony, to the closing and funding of my refi. No run around and no hidden fees. Everything was explained clearly from the beginning.
And when they say, No closing cost.... they mean no closing cost! I would give them more stars if I could!!! Thank you Owning!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Owning did my refinance in two weeks and I got such a great rate, I am saving over $500 per month on my mortgage payment!
The service was awesome, they answered every question in a timely manner and sent the notary to my house for my convenience when it came time to sign the docs.
THE ABSOLUTE BEST PART WAS THIS REFINANCE WAS FREE!!!
I couldn't have asked for a smoother process.  I definitely recommend Owning for your next refinance.  Now is an excellent time to refinance, as the rates have come down!< /review>

<Review>Out of all the refi processes I’ve been through the years, Masa with Owning Corporation was the very best advisor and originator of my loan. Masa was respectful, thorough with his explanation, and very professional.
Vanessa was our loan processor, and she too, was very thorough with the steps that followed. Everything Vanessa said was going to happen, happened in the timely manner.
Masa and Vanessa were simply great!  If I hear of anyone wanting to refi, I will definitely recommend Masa and Vanessa with Owning!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Ownings was simply amazing.  They were very attentive to my needs and quick to respond to my questions.  From start to finish the whole refinance took about two weeks.  Initial contact was made May 5th and the loan funded on May 20th.  A huge Thank You to Andrew and Ana.  Ownings Rocks!<//Text>

I just completed a Re-Fi with Owning and it was a seamless and 5-star experience.

I did a lot of comparison shopping and I can affirm that Owning delivers the promise of a No Fee loan, whereas all of the others had substantial costs, points, or hidden fees.

Do your due diligence. You cannot beat Owning for saving hard cash when you take a loan, and they are FAST and very efficient!

My Agent, John Martinez, is a true professional. He delivered on every promise in an expeditious and very professional manner. In dealing with John I felt that he took the burden off of my shoulders in getting my loan done quickly and correctly.  I highly recommended John.  He's the best.<//text>

They beat a competitive offer that I was already working with and beat them to the finish line,  Funding my loan quickly. Online portal was easy to work with and I only had to work with a small group of people who were with me from start to finish. Glad I gave them a chance.<//Text>

Let me start off by saying I don’t normally write reviews; however, the service I received from Owning was honestly amazing enough for me to write this review.

I have been contemplating for quite some time on refinancing my mortgage because the rates were at an all time low. There are so many lenders out there and I honestly did not know whom to go with.  I was referred over by a friend who previously obtained a mortgage refinance with Owning and kept praising about them and I would not be disappointed. So I took a chance and contacted Owning and spoke with Hai Nguyen.  I told him that this was my first mortgage refinance and I did not know what to expect or where to even start. Immediately, Hai began to walk me through the process and explain in detail each step of the process to me. Each and every question I had, Hai was able to provide me an answer immediately. This says a lot about his knowledge and background in the industry because he was able to quickly and confidently answer any question or concerns I had. He knew exactly what he was doing and this he made me feel extremely comfortable enough to trust him to handle my refinance.

So I proceeded with completing the application, and the following day the loan processor Irene Bang was already contacting me regarding specific documentation needed to proceed with the loan and to schedule an appraisal. Hai and Irene were in constant communication with one another and was consistently following up and updating me on the status of my loan and making sure that I was informed and knew what that was going on and if I had any questions.

I have nothing but positive words to say about Hai Nguyen and Irene Bang. From the first point of contact to closing of my loan, these guys were more than pleasant to work with and know what they are doing.  This will not the last time I will be working Hai Nguyen and Owning.< /Text>

I would recommend Owning to anyone and everyone who is in need of a home mortgage loan. My loan consultant was Robert Ngyuen and he was amazing. Not only was the process very straight forward, Robert is very professional, responsive, provides great clarity and sets proper expectations in regards to the all aspects of the loan. Being in the industry my self, I do appreciate the ease of my refinance process. Owning corporation only requests for information that is pertinent to the loan process. I will definitely refer and recommending Robert Ngyuen at Owning to anyone that is seeking a mortgage loan.<//text>

The process of refinancing my home mortgage through Owning could not have been easier.  We were able to apply online, provide all documentation needed by email, and then sign loan documents at home (a notary public came to our house).  We're very pleased to work with Owning.<//text>

This company treated me and my family with respect as we went through this refinance opportunity.  They heard our needs, met us where we were at, and worked at an amazing pace.  There were no closing costs, it all happened within three weeks, and we were never pressured.</review>

Owning Corporation was very professional. Our initial contact with James who got us started was very knowledgeable and on point, a nice gentleman to deal with, followed by Tracy the loan processor.
We were quite pleased with the loan process savings of over $5,000.00 and also of my being a self employed general contractor the financial documentation required for this loan was much easier than other financial institutions that we had contacted.  We highly recommend calling  Owning Corporation for anyone seeking a home  loan.<//review>

< review>
I would have loved to of given this company a five star rating. Unfortunately they have policies that they have in place and follow but do not make available for their customers to see. I recently finished my refi and it went fairly smoothly and in the timely manner that they said it would. Problem is a few weeks later interest rates dropped even lower. I asked if I could refi again and they said they have a policy they will not do another refi within 12 months. I asked if I could see the documentation that I signed stating that. They said I did not and that it was just a policy that their company follows. The problem is I did not know this policy upfront. They do not disclose that to you upfront.
They told me they would have told me their policies on that if I would have asked. The problem is how are you supposed to know questions to policies that you don’t even know exist. I gave them the opportunity to try and make it right and square it up and maybe put their policies in writing for customers in the future. They did not want hear anything to do with that. Consequently I had three friends that were in the beginning process that now are backed out and five customers that were planning on reaching out to this company. It does seem very shady afterwards that there is policies in place that they do not disclose but yet you were supposed to know to ask these questions.

To be honest in the future I will probably choose a different company. It’s a shame that companies are still playing games like this after all of the housing market crisis and now this COVID-19.
I would love to go back and change my rating at a different date if they decide to change their policies and make their policies public. After the hundreds of pages you sign for a refinance you would think it would be something they would disclose.< /review>

The refinance process was seamless, painless, and efficient. From the beginning, Joseph, the loan officer, was responsive. He got me the best rate compared to the two initial offers I got from different companies. Because he was candid and professional, I decided to go with Owning. Karynn, the loan processor was just as efficient and effective. Once I provided the requested documents, she was able to have my loan closed, literally less than two weeks. Both Joseph and Karynn were effective in their communication and kept me informed throughout the entire process. The customer service was excellent, and the refinance process was the most efficient compared to my past experience from other organizations. It starts with the leadership. It is nice to see the vision of the company and the best practices carried out by the Owning personnel.<//text>

<Review>Very streamlined quick process.  The loan funded within two weeks.  No costs, no points, and a low interest rate....update...the loan process was actually good, however I did expect the loan to be sold off, but not two times in about a week.  The loan went from Owning to the Loan Store to Dovenmuehle Mortgage.  Dovenmuehle Mortgage has some of the worst reviews on Yelp that I have even seen...<//Review><user_id>114801494432680965970< /user_id>< date>

Owning is awesome! I just closed on a refi and was able to lower my rate more than 1.25% with absolutely no closing costs! Not only that, it took them less than 3 weeks from the time I first contacted them until they funded my refi! I worked with Annamae and Michelle and they were absolutely awesome to work with. They took the time to answer all of my questions and kept in constant communication with me, even after funding had completed.< /review>

<text>This is my second time refinancing with Owning. Karen Castro is amazing. I was also helped by Anna Gonzalez. They deliver what they promise.

I recently completed a refinance with Owning. I called on a Sunday and was helped by Karen Castro. From start to finish, she was very communicative and took the time to address all my questions. Karen did an amazing job. I was then assigned to Shenea Nellum for loan processing. She also took care of all my needs and was very communicative throughout the process. All-in-all, the whole process took 17 days from my first call. I am very pleased with their service and the rates that they offer. Owning delivered what they promised and did so in an efficient manner.</text>< Pictures>

- Completed the online form on a Sunday morning and received a call within minutes.
- Completed the initial application over the phone and was told I qualified for the rate and loan amount.
- Received an email within a few hours listing the documents they needed and introduced me to the loan officer.
- Sent the documentation Sunday night
- Received and email from the loan officer Monday morning welcoming me to Owning and to expect an email for e-signatures.
- Wednesday loan approved and rate locked
- The following Wednesday notary came to my house to sign docs.
Highly recommend to anyone!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I saw Owning AD on TV and Radio advertising zero cost to refinance. I needed to refinance my loan the experience I had was excellent. The staff  I dealt with (Gary and  Phoebe) were friendly and responsive.
I may need to do another refinance and will probably select Owning again.

Both, the loan officer and the loan processor were professional and efficient. As a former mortgage loan officer myself, I was truly impressed with these individuals. I will be reaching out to them for any future refinances or purchases as well as referring others to Owning. Thank you John and Michelle.</text>

Refinanced my home with John and Josh. They did a fantastic job. Very prompt and transparent throughout the whole process. They successfully put me in the best possible scenario for what I wanted to accomplish for my refi. Lowered my rate 1 whole point, no PMI, and 80% LTV. I would recommend Owning to friends and family.<//Review>

<review>During the busy Q1 2020, i needed to refi my home loan and reaching out to retail lenders or brokers had always been a daunting affair from understanding the rates, loan fees, rate lock, appraisal entire experience has always been a tricky matter.  Not to mention when lenders are utterly busy they are hard to reach and you are left to follow-up every day. When i almost gave hope, i came across owning.com's great "Refinance It" product with no closing costs and straightforward rates. After applying i got lucky to get in touch with Owning agent Alexander who helped me right away and started working on my application while on the call. He asked me my financial goals and explained the market conditions with atmost patience. Frankly, after speaking to dozens of loan officers i knew that it was very busy period and time was precious for them too. Alex explained my every question with unbelievingly friendly attitude which i personally have never experienced in mortgage industry. Talking to a potential customer with complete honesty and frankness. Though it sounds very basic yet such a rare thing nowadays. He right away offered me best rate with NO closing costs. I had not even spent 20 mins on the call with him. From then until a matter of just 2 weeks my refi was closed briskly with no issues whatsoever. My loan officer Carina was a pleasure to work with too. She was highly efficient which helped us get loan approval in just few days. Amid this increasingly complex mortgage market , Owning is making the whole process simple and efficient. From applying to processing to approval to closing. They do it in matter of days not months not weeks!!! SO you see why i wont hesitate to vouch for them 200%. I do hope you apply with them and get the incredible experience too!</review>< resp>

<review>I worked with Hai and Cindy on refinancing my mortgage and I have to say they were AMAZING to work with. Hai worked with me to get my loan processed over the phone and was extremely dedicated. He worked very fast and helped me save money on my monthly payments. I would not hesitate to work with him again.

Cindy (loan processor) is a rock star! Her communication was excellent and the turnaround time on getting my loan approved and closing my loan was very fast. She has my highest compliments and most sincere gratitude for the work she did on my loan.

Overall, I would give Hai and Cindy 6/5 stars! They were an absolute pleasure to work with and I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with them and Owning.com.

Thank you Hai and Cindy!

In Gratitude,

Wow!  What an amazing experience.  I have been in the banking business for many, many years and I would never have believed that the refinance process could go so smoothly.  Andrew Kiemm and Alex Virkh were the consummate professionals.  They did what they said they would do, within the time the said they would do it.  I can't say enough about how well things went.  I highly recommend Andrew and Alex.< /Review>

This was the easiest, quickest refi I’ve ever done! And the had the lowest rate with  0 pts and $0 fees compared to anyone else. Nine days from the date I completed my loan app to the day I signed docs. My loan officer, Tony (aka James) B and my professor Helen D were fabulous and made everything go so smoothly. I will refi with them again if rates keep going down!
Thank you
PS... I have worked in the mortgage industry since 1990 and know this biz inside and out...this was a great experience!</Text>

< Review>
I have used Owning twice in the last 18 months, chasing rates with three refis during that time. Both with Owning times I was greatly impressed by their prompt, polite, competent service and outstanding communication. Jeremiah was aces as my loan agent both times. I wish I had gone to him first this most recent time instead of to Lenox Financial, which was a total disaster and a waste of five months. The real "no-brainer" is to call Owning.</Review>

<review>Everything was very well done. But here why I gave them 4 stars instead of Five.
The rates dropped and the salesman HAI Never go back with me after I send him a Better rate Quote.  Contacted and called him four times.  I recommended six friends to  to Hai.
Since rates continue to drop I have now sent my friends  information on sites to review,  before they RE Fi.  Big Mistake on HAI's  part !< /review>< Pictures>

I worked with James Galligan and Nikki Pelzl who were personable, efficient, and expeditious with the communication from beginning to end. I substantially dropped my interest rate, everything was finalized in just a few weeks, and the advertising is legit... all costs were covered! I would give Owning more than 5 stars if I could. Great experience!</Review><user_id>100984649351023658406</user_id></record></dataset><record>

best and fastest re-fi that ive ever done. Jesse Kuet was amazingly nice and helpful. he gladly answered all my questions, and there was a lot of them. Edgar coordinated all my information, kinda seemed overwhelmed most of the time, but basically helpful. i would definately use this company again if rates drop again. thanks owning.....you did a great job.</Text>

My loan was just funded last week.  The whole process from start to finish was super smooth and professional. Especially my loan officer (Huy Vu) and loan processor (Kent Tran), they were very responsive to all the questions that  I had. Would definitely recommend Owning to all friends and family.< /text>

Owning Dream Team Michael Ladour, Eddie Li, Irene Wilson, and Jennife Tsai made the whole process of buying our condo a breeze.  All of them were very personable and informative and available anytime to help my wife and I close on our dream home in a highly competitive SoCal market.  We didn't even think it was possible to buy until I spoke with Michael and started to work with this amazing team.  Can't thank them all enough for making dreams come true.< /Review>

Dealth with Alexis Khuc and Nikki Pelzl.  I have a very good experience dealing with both professionals. They requested me to provide all the required documents which I promptly provided in no time.  As such, my loan closed as anticipated.  Thanks to Owning.  It was true as advertised. No closing cost. The only non recurring cost were the old lender payoff fees which was expected.</Text>

<Text>I have used several other loan companies in the past, but never experienced such a smooth experience as I did with Owning Corporation. From the very beginning, the mortgage originator, Ciro Umeres, provided me with all of the documents necessary in order to apply for the refnancing of my home. He told me that the financing would be completed in about two weeks. He was absolutely right. From the time I started the process, to the time my refinance was completed, was exactly two weeks. I have never experienced such a trouble-free transaction as I did with Owning. After working with Ciro, I was assigned to Kim Troung to process my loan. She kept in constant contact with me during the underwriting conditions. I happened to be out of the state during this process, but with the help of Ciro and Kim, I was able to meet with a Notery to sign all the documents necessary to complete my refinance. To rate this company five stars is an understatement. If interest rates go down again in the future, there is no other company that I would work with again other than Owning Corporation. Thank you again for all that you did.</Text>< pictures>

I had just closed on a refi that took over 4 months to complete with another lender when a coworker told me his new home loan with Owning took only 14 days from start to finish. I called and spoke with Anthony Morgan and was offered a half percent lower with no closing costs so my rate and APR were the same. Anthony DiGiorno was my loan processor and my refi took under 2 weeks to complete.  The communication and follow up from both Anthonys was incredible and I am already planning on using Owning again if rates decline further.</review>

Joshua was very helpful and attentive. I would get a response within an hour. Unlike my other lender, not hearing back till the next day.
Nikki the loan processor works weird hours, I got an email from her one time at 11:30 pm. She wasn't as attentive as I would had liked.
We signed on with owning on feb 12th, appraisal came on the 16th, signed closing docs on the 23rd, funded on the 28th.
We did a refi, cash out and paid off the HELOC.<//text>

I decided to refinance a rental with a cash out on January 27, 2020.  Owning Company was recommended by a friend who  just refinanced his home, with Owning Company.  He spoke highly of the company and of their efficiency.  He provided me with their Processor's Name, David Moc, and a contact Telephone number.

I contacted Mr. Moc that afternoon by telephone and was immediately impressed by his professionalism, courtesy and genuine desire to be helpful.  We started the loan process and he provided me with a list of documents his company  would require.  On the morning of January 28, 2020,  I had provided Mr. Moc with the documents he requested, and my credit check was completed.  Mr. Moc had an appraiser contact me that afternoon and an appraisal was scheduled and completed on January 29, 2020.

Mr. Moc then assigned my Loan to, Processor  Mr. Martin Bui, another exemplary professional.  On January 31, 2020, Mr. Bui informed me that my loan was complete and asked if I could sign loan Documents on February 4, 2020, with a closing set for February 10, 2020.

I was out of town, and ended up signing on February 7, 2020.  The loan closed and was funded on February 12, 2020.  In short I have financed a number of properties through the years and this was by far the best mortgage/finance/refinance experience I have ever had.  Mr. Moc and Mr. Bui are both exceptional individuals and their efforts make Owning Company an industry leader.  I highly recommend this company and their employees.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Unbelievable how efficient and fast the process was. I already had a home refinance in the works with two other companies when I heard Owning's commercial on the radio. I called that day (a sunday) and got an immediate response. Within 24 hours I had a lower rate quoted with almost no out of pocket costs, and the loan sailed through, closing and funding in two weeks.  (exceptional work by Steve Medici) As an example of how good the deal was, I told the details to the other two companies, and they both said, if they were in my position, they'd definitely go with Owning.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Where do I begin? It all started last december when I looked into getting PMI removed from my loan with my current mortgage company NEWREZ. After my request was denied pending an appraisal, I decided to look into refinancing my loan. I had always steered away from this idea as I did not like the idea of adding closing fees to my principal, or coming up with cash to pay the usual closing costs associated with refinance. One day I was driving to work when I heard the radio ad for Owning, and their no closing cost refinance. I figured what have I got to lose, and called them. I met John Nguyen, who offered me an incredibly low rate and no PMI. Shortly after signing initial disclosures, my current lender NEWREZ found out I was going to refinance with another lender and called me. They gentleman stated he was from their retention dept. and that they could match the rate just to keep my business in house. I figured since I was already with them, why not. Fast forward two months. New Rez had still not funded my loan, they never returned my calls or emails on time, and I was livid. My wife and I have superb credit, were already financed with them....what was the delay?! I ended up telling them to go pound sand, and called back to Owning to speak with John and do the refi with them. Within two weeks, our loan was funded! He even beat the original rate! To John N, and Nikki P. , thank you so very much for taking care of me and making the entire process easy. I will be sure to refer you to all my friends and family.- Joe M<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402<//gmap_id>< userid>

< Review>
With all the marketing hype in the mass media, I was skeptical at first in Owning's ability to deliver as advertised.

Hello,
I highly recommend ANYONE that is considering refinancing to give Owning a try.  This is my 4th home to own and probably my 6th or 7the refinance experience and by far, Owning was the fastest and easiest refinance of all of them!  It is hard to believe rates are actually lower than 2 years ago, but Owning has proven it to save me thousands of dollars on my home.
You have nothing to loose but a high house payment!

Best Regards,
Tim Hardin<//text>

So if you like me have heard the radio spots for Owning Corp. and have wondered if their services are too good to be true, wonder no more.  Owning and their reps know their business.  I had the privilege to work with Matthew Stasior and Jesse Kuet, Loan Officers and Ann Quach, Processor and found all to be at the top of their fields.  Interest Rate?  Great - even lower than expected.  Closing Costs? A big zero.  Speed?  Closed within 3 weeks.  Communication?  Excellent.  Would I use Owning again?  Absolutely.  You should too.</text>

I was very pleased with Owning Corporation! They are an excellent company who work fast and efficiently to get your deal closed. Everyone I worked with, Anthony DiGiorni - Processor, Jesse Kuet – Loan Officer, and Matthew Stasior – Loan Officer, would always respond right away to all of my questions. I genuinely felt that they were looking out for my best interests throughout the entire process, and working hard to get me the best deal they could. They got me a great APR on my loan and also saved me a lot of money in the closing process.  I would highly recommend them to my family and friends!</Text>

Opened my loan with Christopher and he was always accessible when needed. My loan processor was Shenea, and she went above and beyond. Dealing in real estate for the last 30 plus years, I know your loan processor can make or break a transaction, and Shenea is one of the best I have ever dealt with. She was excellent for communication and always available when I had a question or concern. When the closing happened while I was traveling, she arranged for a notary to meet me and get everything signed. Absolutely the best service! I would not hesitate to refer friends or clients to either of these two folks, and they are who I would call first for any loan needs.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1572483177906, 'text': 'We really appreciate that, Dave, thank you!'}<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7b1334f3e9b:0x9fff8777e9dda402< /Gmap_id></record>

<user_name>Tim W<//user_name><time>1566243129680< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I listen to AM radio in the car.  Probably not the coolest thing to admit.  But that's where I heard about Owning.  In between DUI rep, injury attorneys, and termite commercials.  I was already contemplating a refinance, but had existing referrals to lenders or brokers from others.  I called Owning because I was skeptical.  I wanted to find where they were misleading me.  I then spoke with other lenders/brokers, which made me even more skeptical.  How could Owning's rate be so much better?  I wasn't sure.  So I kicked back and waited until Owning offered a rate no one else could match.  Again... the others weren't sure how I was getting a real rate/estimate so low (at NO cost).  So I crossed my fingers and dove in.

This was not my first loan.  It was not even my first refi.  After Sam Crawford assured me he does this all the time and it was beyond legit, he helped get my application going.  Then, a few days later, I get a call from the processor, Jennifer Newsted.  This is where it REALLY gets good, folks.  Jennifer was continuously on top of it.  Responded to any questions promptly, and, almost like a game of chess, already knew everything that would be needed on my end to get this closed as quickly as possible.  Like some serious Yoda stuff (and I HATE Star Wars).  Never did she advise me that I HAD to do this, or HAD to do that.... she knew it wasn't my first rodeo and wanted me (above all else), to be 100% satisfied and comfortable with my decisions.

I can't say enough about how smoothly everything went from disclosures to underwriting approval to doc signing to funding with Owning.  But more than anything else, I must sing the praises of Jennifer.  She is probably THE best loan processor I've ever worked with, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her and Owning for any refinance need.  My loan was funded in 2 weeks flat from first contact.  That's unreal.  So... listening to AM radio might not be the COOLEST thing to admit to.... but saving a ton of time and money is.  Thank you, Owning!  May you live long and prosper (and I HATE Star Trek).</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Owning Corp. was the best experience my husband and I have encountered for a refinance process. Not only did the application process go smooth but the initial document signing was a breeze. Everyone we spoke to was not only kind but personable too. Everything James Buesing our loan officer told us about our application process/loan process was spot on, he was very informative and nothing went un answered. And Shenea Nellum our processor was soo sweet and got right back to me when I would email her ( and that was often) she was patient and prompt. I highly recommend Owning Corporation for a refinance because of their professionalism and the process was smooth. Thank you, David and Denise Brawner<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>We discovered this company while looking for comapnies to refinance our home. We wanted to get it done before July 1st due to changes in the CALHFA type loans. With the help of Michelle Huynh everything was submitted on time, but CALHFA had refused to accept our subordination. Michelle worked tirelessly to get it approved and we were able to refinance no problem! She was amazing through the whole process and I could not reccomend her more highly.  We have already suggested this company to many friends and family! Thank you Michelle!!</review><Response>{'time': 1572483616583, 'text': 'So happy we could be of help!

<Review>I heard about Owning through a radio commercial and decided to give them a call about a refi. I'm glad I did. They were informative, up front and were not kidding when they said it was a no cost refi (I always have my doubts about any claim of "no cost").  It was a really quick and streamlined process. Great decision to trust Owning with my refi.<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Pamela Hunt<//name><Response>{'time': 1572483784080, 'text': "We're glad you did too, Pamela!

I have refinanced before and this time through Owning was the easiest and quickest, ... it was painless.

My initial contact with Owning was with Robert Nguyan the loan officer on 7/21/19. He was completely up front with me on what Owning could do for me based on the information I provided. After agreeing with the terms I said start the loan process. Part of Owning’s advertizing states they can close the loan in under 21 days, of course this depends on you providing the information needed in a timely manner.

Robert then turned me over to Michelle Huynh who was the loan processor. She needed additional information which I then provided. She guided me through the process like holding my hand and explaining everything in detail with what was needed to get through escrow.

What also amazed me was that after this loan was approved and finished Angela Roque, Owning’s manager of customer satisfaction team called me to see how I felt about the process and the employees involved with this loan.

Our loan was funded on 8/7/19 ... so Owning proved they can close in under 21 days. They only took 18 days and that includes two weekends. A job well done. So on a scale of 1 to 5 ★★★★★ they get ★★★★★★★ 7.

I would highly recommend Owning to anyone looking to refinance or purchase their first home.< /Text>
