We enjoyed an intimate wedding ceremony provided by The Century. The Alcove was elegant, romantic, and whimsical. Our family enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the customer service provided. Allison was amazing on our wedding day and ensured things went smoothly. The food was delicious and served hot. My husband and I couldn't believe how The Century hosted a wonderful celebration for us to cherish forever. Allison took a ton of stress off our plates and we were able to enjoy the festivities. Although we had preferred a male officiant in the beginning, Crystal was phenomenal while implementing the wedding traditions we requested. She did a spectacular job of uniting our marriage. Our DJ was personable and fun! The music kept us entertained as we celebrated while enjoying each other's company. We are totally satisfied with the outcome and will never forget our magical day made possible by The Century!<//text>

The Century is truly amazing.  Each employee is incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  With only 3 mo ths to plan a wedding they made every aspect truly easy.  Allison made planning our wedding stress free.   We were very fortunate they had the day available and were eager to accommodate our needs and guests.  I hope to see them again in the future for other parties.< /Review>

This venue is so beautiful and its all inclusive!! The only vendors you need  to book for your wedding is your photographer and MUA. My husband and I found them about three months before our wedding date 05-20-2021 and they made our dream wedding come true! We had a party of 28 and only celebrated for 3 hours. We were very pleased and happy with the outcome of our wedding, Allison and the team did a great job!</Review>

Given the pandemic, we decided on the new and popular micro-wedding as we did not want to further delay our wedding. As if things weren't challenging enough, we chose to get married in the month of February, when it's cold and usually rains. We had to find a venue that was Covid compliant and somehow still kept us protected from the outdoor elements and this was it. The Century wedding venue came up with a micro-wedding package at their location next door called Nine3One. Communication was great, all of our multiple inquiries, concerns and doubts were always responded to in a timely manner. Allison was our main contact person and she was always very pleasant to speak to even when we felt a little lost and anxious. It was hard for me to put into words what I wanted the setup to look like as far as the decorations, but let me tell you, they far exceeded our expectations. Everything was absolutely beautiful. My family said it was the best wedding food they had ever had, and our cake was so good we will return on our anniversary to order another. Allison took control of the flow of things during the whole event and it was nothing less than perfect. If we had the opportunity to do this again with any venue we would definitely still choose The Century. I don't know many people who can honestly say that their wedding day was perfect and went as planned, but I can! Thank you to all of the staff at The Century for making this happen for us. We will recommend you every chance we get.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>It was wonderful. It was roomy but didn't have enough chairs and tables for everyone. Standing in heels all night was not my idea of fun. It was a union function and I had a chance to chat with Janet Fonda! That was the highlight of the evening. Restrooms were very clean and orderly. If anyone wants to throw an event it will be a great venue.<//text>< Pictures>

I film weddings and events for a living and this was a really nice "all-in-one" venue. Really romantic lighting and decor. Plenty of space for family to lounge on. I felt the flowers needed to be in place much sooner, tho, because I needed to film it before guests came in. They were decorating up to the last moment. I'm not sure why the DJ's speakers were placed so close together on one side of the room. Speakers ought to be placed far apart for a more balanced sound (and less deafening for the table of guests seated nearest). The officiant flubbed his lines but I can clean up the video, I think. Overall, a very pleasant venue and parking is a breeze on a Sunday.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The Century is hands down the BEST wedding/special event venue in town! They’re a one stop shop that helps you every step of the way in planning your BIG DAY! I Was able to wake up the day of my wedding and enjoy every second of my wedding day. Not having to stress and worry about anything was the ultimate gift The Century staff gave me and I’ll always cherish every memory from my wedding. Your family will appreciate you booking this venue because not only do you get to enjoy your day so will your family! Getting to see my parents enjoy themselves and not having to worry about set up or clean up was the icing on the cake. The DJ was hands down the best MC (George Gonzalez)I’ve ever seen, he had my grandma out on the floor bustin moves! From the decor, floral, food, DJ, Photo Booth,  cake, alcohol ......it was all perfection!</review>< pics>

My daughter got married last weekend and i just want to say thanks again to the owners and staff at The Century.  They were so professional, but also so nice through the whole process.  They made everything so easy. They got our opinions and ideas and went to work.  Our special day was even better due to the care, attention, hard work and time that they put into their events.  Everything at the reception was absolutely beautiful. Thanks again.</review>

<Review>Where do I begin?! The venue for one is beautiful but I had to make this review especially for Erin and the team at The Century. They are amazing! From the beginning to the end they were just an email, text, or call away. They made sure everything was perfect on the wedding day. Erin, the owner and the staff are professional and on top of everything. You can tell they are very passionate with what they do. Everyone was also so sweet and took the time to make sure my husband and I were doing OK.

There are many wedding venues out there. However, there are not many that has a team that works so well and treat their clients and their guests with kindness and great customer service.

Not to mention, our limo cancelled on us few days before the wedding and we couldn't find one last minute that will transport 15-20 people. We told Erin our issue and she went above and beyond. Luckily she found one for us. To say we hardly write reviews says a lot. We are truly ecstatic that we came across The Century.

Thank you Erin and the entire team.</Review>< Pictures>

Did the elopement package here, beautiful venue with a rustic vibe. However, the photographer provided is not too good our photos came out low quality especially inside the venue and we didn't receive the photos until over a month later. The officiant messed up on our back story as we told them not to provide one and they gave us somebody else's random story. They also messed up on our guest list they didn't have the full list. Food, drinks, and cake was good. A/C is a little loud so people couldn't hear my vows and I am a soft spoken person as it is. The coordinator was very helpful the day of to let you know where to be.</Text>

<text>Having attended two events here as a guest, I can say there was no expense spared in developing this venue. The attention to detail is imbeccable and the design classy beyond what Modesto has seen before. The staff and management are professional and are invested in presenting the best experience to their guests. I have not personally hosted an event here but I do very much look forward to doing so one day as I am sure it will turn out beautifully. It's really refreshing seeing a business that is so determined in providing a first-class experience!< /text>< Rate>

First of all shame on me for not getting this done months ago. The Century along with Erin and her amazing staff gave my celebration the detail and attention I would expect to pay dearly for. I asked for a million dollar look and feel and it is exactly what we received!  Every detail was guided and guarded by Erin. She is professional, yet so warm I consider her a friend. Her staff is exceptional and if your looking to blow the minds of your friends and family give Erin a call for your special event.  I will forever be grateful to Erin for helping me to realize a dream come true!< /text>

I got married at the Century 12/10/17. The venue is absolutely beautiful. In the beginning the staff was very helpful, they allowed a MAJOR change to my event with no hassle or problems. After that, communication was mediocre at best,  my event as a whole felt completely unorganized, I was completely
Unhappy w/ the DJ. It all just felt very unorganized & nothing like I had imagined. I was underwhelmed completely & it definitely didn't feel as though they plan events on a regular, over all very disappointed</Review>

We had our wedding at The Century in October 2015. When originally looking for a venue I was referred to The Century and wasn't sure because I wanted an outdoor weeding. As soon as my husband and I saw the venue we immediately made the decision to have our wedding there. Erin, the owner, really wanted to make sure we were happy with our decision and I have to say we are SO happy we had our wedding at The Century. Erin is very professional, always answered my emails and made sure EVERY question I had got an answer. The day of the wedding Erin and her staff made sure my bridal party and I were taken care of all day and the entire night. My bridesmaids and I were able to get ready in the beautiful bridal suite making it very easy and relaxing the morning of. My guests also loved the venue and gave many conpliments to Erin, her staff, and the beauty of the venue. I would highly recommend The Century to any couple looking for a wedding venue, you will not be disappointed!<//text>

<Text>We had our wedding ceremony/ reception at nine 3 one. It's a smaller venue right next to the Century. The venue is so naturally beautiful, the decor just picked it's self out! It's also all inclusive so there is no need to look elsewhere. Allison was my coordinator, she was absolutely on point and professional. I couldn't have asked for anything better that day because of her and her staff! Rachel Destiny and Alex I saw them work along with Allison to make sure that everything ran smoothly and my guests were well taken care of. Yuonne was the bartender for the night super bubbly and fun to talk to! I was able to enjoy the night because of them!< /Text>< user_id>

< Review>
I ordered shrimp fried rice. It smelled like old grease. It needed more shrimp. Customer service was not good. No food was out. They cook behind a curtain. My food was nasty. I forced myself to eat 1/4 th of it.  I'm not eating the rest. A waste of my money. I will not be returning.</Review>

The pork batter was soggy and tasted horrible.  No rice was served.  The on the side sweet and sour sauce had an odd unpleasant taste.  The egg rolls were greasy.  I was starving; however, the food was so bad that I was unable to eat.  I will never order from this restaurant again.

Terrible, horrible and can't cook anything. This place should be closed for people who want to serve good food. I ordered eggplant and got a plate full of grease. All I was eating was grease, it was gross.</review>

Run a start-up nearby and I eat here probably twice a week. Food is above average for Chinese take out while quantity and price is unbeatable especially for the lunch specials.</Review>

A little greasy and doesnt taste too sanitary either. But never had a horrible experience but never had a great one either. For example, the fried rice tasted premade and old.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Cedric and his staff handled our K1 Visa/Adjustment of Status process, and we are extremely grateful. His advice and guidance all the way through was spot-on and we were always informed of what was happening. While this isn't an easy process - especially now - Cedric’s help made it straightforward and manageable, and we would definitely recommend his services.< /text>

Cedric and his team at Maximilian Law were very professional and helpful. We were handed an extremely difficult situation with a visa during the COVID 19 pandemic and they really went the extra mile to help us. I would highly recommend them.</Text>

<review>I recently used Cedric's services for a TN visa. Right from the start he was professional, friendly, and gave great advice. Cedric always responded to my  questions and concerns in a timely manner. He's been very supportive throughout the entire visa process, which helped to relieve a lot of stress. I would definitely recommend Cedric, and I will surely be using his services again if needed in the future. He's an awesome guy!< /review>< pictures>

Cedric is amazing! He made the whole process of our Adjustment of Status application so smooth. We had a million questions along the way, and he was always available to answer anything we needed. Initially we were looking for a lawyer who specialized in Canada/USA immigration to guide us through the steps, which is how we found Cedric through online searching, and after our first phone inquiry I was confident that he was perfect for us. With all the paper work and small details being so important when dealing with immigration, you want to make sure you have a professional helping you, and Cedric is hands down the best in the business. The whole process even went much quicker than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Cedric and Maximilian Law, and plan to use him again when we need to apply for the next steps of permanent residency in a couple of years. Thank you Cedric!< /review>

Cedric made this complicated process seem like a breeze. He is knowledgeable, approachable, and patient. He walked me through the entire process and ensured I understood all aspects. Cedric and his staff demonstrated professionalism and personal attention to all details of my immigration. Additionally, I’d like to commend Cedric on his people skills. He is friendly and approachable with outstanding communication skills. I highly recommend Cedric and look forward to working with him in the future!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Working on my green card application with Cedric and his team was an incredibly positive experience. Besides doing excellent work throughout the application process itself, his office was always very attentive and thorough when I had any questions, concerns, or simply wanted an update. Navigating each step felt very straightforward with Cedric's guidance, which both my sponsor and myself greatly appreciated. Acquiring any immigration document is an incredibly stressful experience, and I'm very grateful to have gone through it with their support. Thanks, Cedric & co!<//Review>< resp>

<text>Cedric helped my husband with his naturalization process and helped me with my green-card application. He is very easy to communicate with. You can always reach him anytime if you have concerns. He will answer all of your questions with patience. Every time before important dates, for example, interviews, he would always call a week beforehand to talk about how we should prepare ourselves. He is also very thorough. Even after my green-card application was approved and the interview was done, he would email me to check if everything is alright. We actually live in San Diego rather than Los Angeles, but Cedric managed to make the whole communication process, even when we actually are far away from his office, pretty easy. We are very grateful for his patience and help along the way!!<//text>< Pics>

Cedric is absolutely fantastic to work with. He guided my wife and I through the process of getting a green card through marriage. He was always available over the phone to answer our questions and prompt to reply through email. Great communication and made what would have been a very complicated process on our own simplified and easier to understand. We were able to get my green card in 2.5 months. Would highly recommend Maximilian Law!< /review>

The staff at Maximilian Law is highly professional and knowledgeable on immigration laws, and it was a wonderful experience working with them.  From the initial consultation to our most recent correspondence, Cedric has always immediately responded to my concerns.  He has made the process very easy to understand and took great care to address all the little details that I would not have thought of otherwise.  His team is also very professional and have been extremely helpful each and every time I've connected with them.</Review>

You want an attorney and a paralegal who you'll feel absolutely comfortable working with and sharing your most personal information.

Even though I never met attorney Shen in person and I also did not live in CA, I chose this firm over others near me.  From the very first phone call, I had a feeling that the attorney was an honest and respectful person. I also spoke with the paralegal (Ms. Martinez), and she was just as professional and efficient. Both of them were very prompt in all their emails.

My case also was another success story without complication. This was a good experience. I would recommend this law firm to everyone who needs immigration help!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Fantastic immigration law firm! I can't recommend it highly enough!  Cedric was an amazing guide through the process of applying for, and obtaining a green card. He is detail-oriented, clear in his communications, prompt and patient in his responses, and extremely knowledgeable. We found his confidence and information to be comforting. All of the information he requested for the application meant there were no follow-up questions from the feds. The preparation he gave us for the interview meant we had everything the interviewer asked for.  The interviewer actually said we were the most organized, easiest interview he has had. Thanks Cedric & Team!< /Review>

Prior to engaging the services of Maximilian Law, I spoke with four other immigration lawyers and none seemed to possess the same balance of competency, direct accessibility, experience, and practical wisdom that Cedric exhibited.  From our initial consultation, to the various templates he sent me, to his wise document editing / suggestions, to the awesome personal coaching session to help me prepare for the interview—everything was done with excellence and in my best interest.  He even answered emails on the weekend prior to my POE interview.

I wholeheartedly and unreservedly endorse Cedric and Maximilian Law!< /Text>< pictures>

I've found the legal team at Max Law to operate with the upmost integrity and professionalism and importantly, they seemed to actually care about netting me a positive outcome. Cedric was extremely patient and took the time to answer all my legal questions/concerns. Whenever I would email him, he would reply promptly, evenings or weekends.  I would definitely recommend this law firm to my family, friends, acquaintances or anyone in need of immigration legal services. Ask for Cedric!!!  Five ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Review>< Rating>

< review>
Maximilian Law was very helpful and professional in advising me on work visa options for entry into the United States from Canada and for assisting me with the process.  The legal fee was very reasonable and there were no hidden costs or surprises.

I have recommended Maximilian Law to colleagues for assistance and advice with citizenship and immigration applications.

Thank you Cedric.</review>

I highly recommend Mr. Cedric Maximillian Shen as an immigration attorney. Having gone through the process of immigration and obtaining a green card, I can assure you that Mr. Shen’s professionalism and knowledge has made this process run very smoothly, providing me and my family time and energy to focus on our lives. I learned through this process that there are several qualities one should look for in an immigration attorney and they are: (1) knowledge and expertise; (2) reasonableness and ability to convey difficult legal terms into layman’s language; (3) speed and accuracy; (4) reasonable fees; (5) trustworthiness; (6) professionalism; (7) attention to detail; (8) excellent written and oral communication skills; and (9) availability. Mr. Cedric Shen exceeded all of these qualities and more. We are grateful for his guidance at every step. I feel so lucky that I made that first call after reading excellent Yelp reviews. He has been amazing and he has demonstrated an exceptional work ethic and expertise. Without hesitation, I have been referring friends and family that need assistance with any immigration issues and the consensus among those I’ve referred has been, “Cedric is amazing!”.<//Text>

< Review>
My husband and I knew we needed a lawyer to help with our immigration process because I had a complicated situation. After contacting lawyers in our area who basically said we’d either need a waiver or flat out told us I wouldn’t qualify for a green card, we started to look for someone in California and that’s when we came across Maximilian Law. What originally drew us to Cedric’s firm was that he is originally from Canada (like myself, so he’s already super cool lol). Then, after we had the initial consultation with him over the phone we both knew that he was ‘the one’ we wanted to work with. Cedric was honest in making sure we knew all options and the pros/cons of each, then once we decided what we wanted to do, he was there every step of the way answering any questions or concerns we had (and boy did we have a lot!) There were some difficult hurdles to get over and Cedric helped us get through all of them. My husband and I can't thank him and Karina enough for not giving up on us. We know 100% we would not have been able to do this on our own, and can't think of any other lawyer who we’d trust to handle our applications. We’re definitely going to be using them again for the GC renewal or possibility of citizenship down the road!</Review>

As well as being super thorough and very detail focused, Cedric Shen and his staff are so responsive and friendly you will not believe you are dealing with a lawyer! They really know the ropes in terms of immigration and guide you clearly through what you need to do and then they get you into the system and track things. They make what is an extremely daunting and confusing application process work for you. My husband and I could not be more satisfied or happier with the work of Cedric Shen and his staff. We highly recommend his services.</Review>

<text>Being on the east coast, My wife and I were a little worried about working with someone we had never met in person. We took the chance and contacted Cedric, and I'm definitely glad we did!

Being a Canadian citizen seeking immigration to the US to be with my wife, Cedric helped me throughout the process from start to finish and was always up-to-date with any changes in laws, forms, or requirements. In fact, Cedric may have very well saved us from returning for a second greencard interview by informing us of changes to one of the required forms!

In the end, I received the best Christmas present I could have asked for: My greencard came just two days before Christmas!

Thanks Cedric!<//text></record>

Cedric Shen replied me fast on the same day on Feb 12 2018 and requested additional information. After sending the additional info, he never got back to me. I waited for two weeks, and then asked again on Feb 24th and still nothing on Mar 25.

I would have appreciated even a clear no to my request. Now I’m left wondering why he wasn’t interested in my Canadian visa case. Waste of time.

Edit on March 28 2018: Mr. Shen continued with my case and was extremely helpful. He also replied to my review in the best way. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars. Thank you.< /text>

<review>After hearing about lengthy experiences to obtain a US visa, we reviewed many immigration lawyer profiles online and luckily we found Cedric.  The first time we spoke to him, he was so forth coming about the steps that we need to take and didn't ask for a retainer like most others.

We eventually chose him to represent us for our E2 application since he was a Canadian and lived in the US so had first hand experience.  Throughout the whole process his team was on top of our deadlines and helped us gather/prepare our information to be best presented.

In only a month and a half, his office secured our interview date, we then went to the interview with the prepared documents and got our visa the same day.  Cedric and his office were so efficient in their communication and very professional.  We referred our friends to him already.

I recommend his office to anyone looking to apply for a visa.< /review>< rating>

Look no further for a highly skilled, extremely reliable, and easy to work with lawyer. I used Mr. Shen's services for my Green Card- the entire process was stress-free and as fast as it can possibly be. What we liked the most was his communication with us from start to finish. Mr. Shen was always available to answer our questions, he put us at ease, and gave us advice every step of the way. He kept us updated on every correspondence he received on our behalf and followed-up with us after every application filing and any appointments and meetings we needed to attend. He held our hand through the entire process and made us feel very comfortable and confident throughout all this legal and immigration stuff that was very foreign to us. My husband and I say we wish we could hire Mr. Shen for everything in life. Not to mention his prices were very fair and reasonable considering how much time he spent with us over the phone, email and of course while doing our paperwork for us.<//review>

< Review>
I was referred to Maximilian Law, and Cedric Shen a couple years ago when I decided to start my company in the USA. I found Cedric to be extremely easy to work with, he explained everything very clearly to me, and was there every step of the way.
During this process I had to be out of the USA for a certain period, during that time, an emergency arose and it was critical for me to return to the US immediately, even though my time there had expired. I emailed Cedric from Lima, Peru explaining the problem and within a couple of hours he got in touch with me on the phone, with answers and options. THAT is what a good lawyer does.
When the time finally came for me to go to the US Embassy for my visa interview, the extensive pile of paperwork was all in order, I breezed through the interview in no time, and had no problems answering the questions.
My lawyer had prepared me well... Sitting there, listening to applicants being interviewed at the other windows I realized some of these people probably weren't getting their visa. I consider myself very lucky to have found Maximilian Law to help me with this difficult process, and I highly recommend Cedric Shen. Two years later, my business is thriving and i'm having fun in the California Sunshine! Thank you Cedric!</Review>

The prepared foods I bought were very good,  but the meats selection at Glatt Mart is better.  Still,  parking was easy and both customers and employees were friendly< /review>

Awesome community supermarket catering to the Jewish community, glatt.

The guy who runs the Deli in the back, Shimon is a miserable person and takes his unhappiness out on the employees and the customers. It's unfortunate.

The deli serves fresh made hummus to kabobs and all sorts of fresh food. My favorite is Harisa, a very spicy chili paste. Get a bit of it with whatever else you buy..

Very clean market. The prices are about 30% to 40% higher than other markets. Look at the pictures; a small box of crackers is almost $7 over twice as expensive, a bag of frozen broccoli is over $6 over 70% more expensive, bag of frozen chopped spinach is $11 over 300%, more than 3 times as much as another market.< /text>

< Review>
We had the most terrible shopping experience last night in that store with the stuff that was there and especially with the manager Juan.
it was behind any excuses we've seen on their website that they're closing at 9 pm and because we leave in Sacramento we always shopping there just before we drive back to minimize the time that our food will be unrefrigerated. so we got there at 7:55 pm and after 5 min we heard that the store will be closed in 30 min I went over to the manager and told him that it says on their website that they closing at 9 pm and he told me that he knows that but they changed it from March and it is what it is. I told him that we will do our best to be as fast as possible. from that moment every 5 minutes, they announced that the store is closing everybody should come immediately to the front. after 15 mi they closed the lights on us literally through us off the store. we got to the cashier they had the most disgusting attitude you can imagine and when I told the manager that I've forgotten my Cambridge card in Sacramento but I have a picture of it he literallyenjoyed repeating himself over and over No No No No No I can't help you this is my rules and that's it!
I told him to think for a second before you behaving like I'm your enemy I'm your customer. Did you ever went in your life to a store and they closed the lights on you? and even worst 15 minutes before closing time!!! especially when it says on their website that they closing at 9 pm.
I never write bad reviews, but this time I'm doing it to wake up the management!!! you guys are losing customers because of terrible customer service and a terrible manager. Guys get your things together, your stuff is terrible and rude that's not the way to keep customers.

I will be more than happy to adjust the review to a higher rate, just let me know that you got the message and you will be taking care of that.the last thing that I went to is to hurt your business with a bad review.

Owner Responded and Took care of the Situation Quickly and Effectively and we are highly appreciating that</Review>

I have spoken to my manager and we are working to make sure this does not happen again.\n\nSince the beginning of COVID-19 there has been a lot of miscommunication with regards to our business hours and we are working hard to fix this. Our current priority is to ensure a safe and pleasant atmosphere for all our customers.

This mall is by far the best shopping center  High end stores beautiful inside layout is easy and very clean!  Lots of big tall fiddle fig bushes and bird of paradise fill the decor.Best grocery store ever! The staff, place, and selections of foods, vegetables, fruits, meats were excellent
and nice.<//review>

There is much appreciation in the unity and the humble way in which decisions are made. there's been amazing news about this place since there is objectiveness and how professionalism is conducted.  I applaud those involved in the positive changes, through the unconditional adherence in upholding the sanctification of Gods name. Even though there are daily challenges for all businesses, each and every staff member does a fantastic job here.</review><user>104633188950581398739</user><response>None<//response>< time>

I shop There pretty off en because it's the only Kosher store around me... but honestly you have to be super careful with the prices because on the shelf it says one price and at the check out they charge more over and over .... super frustrating! So look at you receipt and pay attention to the prices< /Review>

<Review>My first and favorite Whole Foods market. When I lived close to this market, I like going there doing my personal purchases. There are everything and different prices. Not bad quality but you have the choice, if your wallet is full or a little bit empty in the month. Some employees are helpful other not, it's the new world rules!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I wish I had the option to leave negative rating because they don't even deserve one star.

No customer service whatsoever. Absolutely ignorant & rude employees and managers.  They have no loyalty for their customers.

Convenient location  for me to buy my kosher meat from on daily basis.  The quality of their meat is very low most of the time. Being their customer for about 10 year now, I have learned when to buy the packaged meat so it's almost fresh.

Their meat and deli department prices are somewhat reasonable but the prices for the rest of the stuff is about 30% to 40% higher than other markets in the area.

There have been times that I have gotten spoiled dairy products or very old bread from them and they had a very hard time returning my money.<//text>

<response>{'time': 1566754122782, 'text': "First of all, thank you for being a loyal ten year customer. It was nice speaking to you on Friday and I am sorry we don't see things eye to eye. I had thought that after our conversation we had come to an understanding.\n\nThe reason why some of the items cost 30-40% higher is because they are kosher items that have been imported from parts of the country or even from outside of the country. The shipping on these items are very expensive.\n\nIn addition, the items that are certified kosher go through special inspections to meet kosher standards. For example, broccoli, spinach and cauliflower go through a thorough inspection to make sure they are free of bugs. The same applies to cheeses which have certifications of their own. This leads to a significant increase in cost.\n\nIn regards to the moldy cheeses, the products we received come from smaller companies who use packaging methods that are not perfect. Sometimes air goes into the packaging. This leads to mold spots forming on the cheese.\n\nThe breads are handled by their respective bakeries. Usually someone from the bakery is supposed to remove all the old products and replace them with fresh products. Sometimes if a product from one bakery is left in a different section the bakery will miss a product. This is a rare occurrence and does not usually happen.\n\nWe try to remove all these products off the shelf to prevent customers from receiving them. In the event that a customer leaves with such products we will gladly offer them a refund.\n\nThank you for you time,\n\nAvraham Shamoil"}</response>< Gmap_id>

Best kosher grocery store in the valley. Great sushi! Very compete selection of everything you'd need. Lots of wines. Big freezer section. Butcher and meat is well priced. Parking can be tough - park on the street is you can't find any in the lot.  Tip: call ahead and order sushi platters for your events and private parties. They're around $35 for small platters, great for single families, and $70ish for large platters that will easily feed 10+< /Review>

< review>
I would give them 4 stars for the selection but their exceptionally rude employees deserve negative stars. The few Latin employees are pleasant and polite but the non Latin employees are anything but. I have been shopping there for more than a year and at thier best I am simply ignored at thier worst I am treated like I am not even human.  I won't shop there at all but they carry 2 non dairy items I can not find anywhere else.  The employees behavior isn't a lack of manners and common curticy, it's a prejudice that it so pervasive its felt even in thier parking lot.  I had a cashier today recoil and sneer when I tried to hand him money.  Apparently they teach thier employees that some people's money is too dirty to even touch.  I am tempted to go back and buy $400 worth of groceries and pay in $1.00 bills. Just to prove that my money won't give them cooties.<//review>

<Text>A great place for Kosher products and Israeli products.
They have a huge selection, and it will be rare if you will not find what you are looking for.
For my opinion, they should have non Jewish products, so people who need both things will be able to complete the shopping there, and won't have to go to another place for the missing things.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I would give 4.5  for the fresh produce and prices in this store. However, it is hard to know when it is open. The site says it is open, the posting on the door says it opens at 7:00 a.m. I go there only to find it is closed.
I think they should get this straight.</Text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. The store employees are the grumpiest, rudest people I have ever come across. I will never step foot in that store again. I will definitely take my business and money elsewhere where you are not judged. The Deli counter employees are unbelievably ignorant and rude talking amongst themselves and getting annoyed when they have to help a customer. If you are not Jewish be warned you will be treated rudely and get dirty looks from the shoppers and employees.< /review>

<Review>My experience here was nice. I enjoyed the selection of groceries and service that was available. Preferably, since i like to buy produce in bulk i will rarely ever buy from markets. Some of the prices where fair, but then again you can also find better prices at ralph's or trader joe's. It happens to be very busy from Thursday afternoon till late afternoon Friday due to the Sabbath.</Review>< name>

If you are not jewish you will be considered like a Dog. It seems to be a constant in jewish shops, they always treat you like crap as soon as they realize your are not jewish. The only helpful person there was a Mexican at the fruit section.
Also it's dirty and very expensive so no regret there...< /text>

Used to live here about 4 years and it only seems to get better and better with each new home coming in. Great neighborhood and neighbors I actually miss our place in there. I'm living close still so maps thinks that's where I'm going still.< /text>

<Review>I have a GOOD FRIEND that lives in this park and for the most part it is a nice place. Unfortunately they do not provide high enough fencing between properties to protect you from the neighbors dogs. Also with as modern as the park is technologically speaking I find it shocking that they don’t have a PHONE TREE emergency notification set up in their computer system for events like happened this weekend. IE: water main break and no gas! If they would set up an automatic phone tree to let residents know they are aware of the issues they would receive less COMPLAINT CALLS. They could also use same auto response system to notify everyone of the progress on the repairs🙂 Easy fix!<//Review>< Pictures>

Me and my family has been here for 5 years prior to us moving in we would observe the community to see how it was would come early mornings, late evening, and late nights before we decided to buy our home. When we first moved in it was a lot of kids who were very disrespectful and destroying things. The community went through maybe 4 office manager before getting someone who cared the property, I like the current office staff and Jim is great and helpful and Pam is polite and professional when doing business. If I could request two thing to change that would be to allow us to have alcohol in the clubhouse when hosting parties, and big dog where I can't enjoy my backyard due to the smell of dog poop. Overall everything is great and I look forward to staying here for a long time.< /Text>

So far we have gotten one car towed for parking in front of our own place. But no one else cars get towed when parked outside their own homes. The place is nice, comfortable, but seems like a lot of double standards and favoritism.< /review>

What happened to this place? Ordered a sandwich and they gave it to me burnt. I went back and they gave me this...a morsel of chicken and they forget the extra turkey I paid for. It's not even worth going back to. Ever. Again.<//Text>

<review>All in all, a pretty decent food and beverage experience! Monte 52 is located inside of the Tropicana Market right in Highland Park. In fact, it almost seems to be multiple businesses in one...you have Monte 52 which takes care of your eating needs, a Kombucha/coffee/smoothie bar to the side which seems to be it's own entity, all located within this cute little market that sells everything from fresh produce to traditional and unique grocery items. It seems to be a very interesting business model, as you pay for all your separate food and drink items at the main counter for the market. This brought on an hour long convo between hubby and I about gentrification and how businesses can stay authentic yet stick with the times and stay relevant...but i digress haha.

Service was generally friendly but pretty slow. We did have to wait a bit for our food (but again, we were occupied and immersed in existential conversation), and we also had to flag down the kombucha lady as she was sitting in the back on her phone...by the time they found her, there were a few people waiting to place an order with her.

Food was decent - a few select breakfast dishes and vegan options available. We opted for a breakfast burrito, a Monte Cristo sandwich and a hash mash with soyrizo. I did enjoy the burrito but my hubby's sandwich was pretty soggy. The hash mash was also not bad but, in wrapping the food to bring to us, the wrapping warped so badly to the cheese that we lost all of it when it was time to eat and unwrap. Sad day. We did realllyyy enjoy the kombucha on tap though and highly recommend trying it! You can also purchase and fill growlers there as well!

I think i would be down to go back again and maybe try the place out for lunch!<//review><Name>Josefina Klein<//Name></record></dataset><record>

My first experience here was pretty decent. Had to find street parking for lunch. The wheat bread was super good, the veggies were fresh & the service wasn't too bad either! Try it! You won't regret it:)</Review>

<review>The most outrageously delicious sandwich ever!! I had the Reuben! The meat was juicy with crispy bits on the ends, on tasty rye bread with house made purple slaw/sauerkraut,  house made pickles, melted cheese and creamy tangy mustard. 10.95, and well worth it.  I'd got again in a heartbeat!!<//review>< pics>

<review>Had the tri-tip sandwich on French roll. It was delicious, on Tuesdays they have the crab sandwich as a special. Will try that tomorrow. I ran into this place by accident, I was across the parking lot at a store. I notice it and though I check it out. I will definitely be a regular here going forward.</review>< time>

Most recently, it took nearly 40 minutes for my sandwich order to be completed, and, while I was waiting, I watched as both cooks handled food and cookware with their bare hands--no gloves, no washing in between orders, nothing. Absolutely unsanitary. Food has been largely hit-or-miss recently, as well. Sometimes orders (though they take over half an hour to make) are delicious, other times they are sloppily made and/or the order itself is wrong/it just tastes bad. Hope they get it together soon.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great little sandwich shop/deli tucked in the back of the corner store. I've been coming to Monte since day one. They have transformed the corner and are now a staple.

Sandwiches range from good to excellent. The menu changes every once in a while with current favorites being the cheese steak and fried chicken. French fries are great too now.

<review>I Love the Sandwich Spot so much that I had to try this location too. I got a little lost looking for it, but eventually I pulled into the parking spot directly in front and ran in for my yummy sandwich. While I do agree that it is very unique that both locations have the same menu, only different titles (different local sports teams and/or schools), it can be a little confusing. Either way, the sandwiches are great. Their sauces are delish too! Only complaint is that the restaurant wasn't very clean.< /review>< response>
{'time': 1538605540349, 'text': "Hi Mary. I think you may have been mistaken in your review, as we are Monte 52 and not the Sandwich Spot. Monte 52 is very clean and doesn't rely on pandering to local school sports fans. Come and check us out sometime. Thanks!"}</response>

<review>I come here at least three times a week to get there breakfast burrito and pick up a ginger beer to start the day right. I grew up in highland park so getting used to all the hwhite people moving in has been strange to say the least but this sup has made the transition much better. This store incorporated the new residents and their "style" while preserving the original feeling of this little bit of the soon to not be "hood".</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c41cbb590b47:0xe53bd958a0498522</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Terrible customer service! I had placed my order via telephone prior to arrival. I waited in the store at the sandwich counter for at least 20minutes while consistently attempting to get an employees attention. Yes every one behind the counter seemed occupied and in motion, but common courtesy tells you to at least have one person taking orders or checking in with the customers waiting in line at the very least. Once I finally got the girls attention at the counter she litteraly just ignored me then proceeded to welcome a guy who just barged his way to the counter and said he was here for a postmates order (I guess thats what needs to be done to receive a response here). When the girl at the counter finally acknowledged me I was told my order was just waiting on the frys, so I waited, and waited... Throughout this wait I had decided to give the juice bar a try. I asked the guy working the juice bar counter what he'd recommend, his exact response was "Most of the drinks on the menu aren't even real, like for example we have an iced cappuccino but cappuccino is a foamy drink thats made from hot coffee therefore there is no such thing as an iced cappuccino." So I decided to try something new and ordered the Blended-Hortchata drink. The employees response was "oh we actually dont have Hortchata and ironically never have" in a very serious tone I proceed to inquire as to why it's even listed as an option on menu then? I mean clearly it says Blended- Caramel, Mocha, Hortchata.. His response was nothing more than a mere chuckle and scratch on his head. So finally I gave up and ordered just a plain mocha blend (Frappuccino) nothing special right? But it doesn't stop there, instead the same employee litteraly tells me "oh I dont know how to make that kind of drink, so my coworkers going to help you out ok" then he proceededs to make his own ice coffee in front of me, walk away and sit down in the corner, didnt even mention my order, I had to tell the poor other hard working lady (whom I am sure carries out 90% of the shifts duties all on her own) what my order was. Not to mention the guy who originally was helping me (suppose to be of help) didn't even take this as an opportunity to learn how to blend a Frappuccino, he simply just turned the whole responsibility over to his coworker and decided to take a break. Anyhow..
At this point I was super fed up already, finally grabbed my sandwich order (which was already 22minutes OVER what they estimated to me on the phone) and left. Arrived home ate extremely cold and soggy food (tasted like it had been sitting for hours) and to no avail... NO french frys in the bag! (That's what I'd been waiting for!)
I swear these employees must have been high, drunk, or out right careless; It's the only plausible explanation! This is a shame because I had high expectations coming in after all the buzz going around town and hearing good things coming from close friends and family members. I don't like to come off as if I'm attacking any one particular business when I do these reviews, but when I have an experience such as this one, I believe my experience needs to be put into perspective.< /Review>

<Text>Been coming here a little over 6 months. Everytime I'm in the area, I just have to stop by this shop. They also got a juice bar inside. Pulled BBQ Pork Sandwich, is hands down the best I've had in years. (I'm a self proclaimed BBQ pulled pork aficionado). The way they put together the food is crazy awesome. Get you a sandwich, a coke, sit down and enjoy the culture that Highland Park is known for. Great little find I will admit. Hope they stay here for years to come.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>All in all, a pretty decent food and beverage experience! Monte 52 is located inside of the Tropicana Market right in Highland Park. In fact, it almost seems to be multiple businesses in one...you have Monte 52 which takes care of your eating needs, a Kombucha/coffee/smoothie bar to the side which seems to be it's own entity, all located within this cute little market that sells everything from fresh produce to traditional and unique grocery items. It seems to be a very interesting business model, as you pay for all your separate food and drink items at the main counter for the market. This brought on an hour long convo between hubby and I about gentrification and how businesses can stay authentic yet stick with the times and stay relevant...but i digress haha.

Service was generally friendly but pretty slow. We did have to wait a bit for our food (but again, we were occupied and immersed in existential conversation), and we also had to flag down the kombucha lady as she was sitting in the back on her phone...by the time they found her, there were a few people waiting to place an order with her.

Food was decent - a few select breakfast dishes and vegan options available. We opted for a breakfast burrito, a Monte Cristo sandwich and a hash mash with soyrizo. I did enjoy the burrito but my hubby's sandwich was pretty soggy. The hash mash was also not bad but, in wrapping the food to bring to us, the wrapping warped so badly to the cheese that we lost all of it when it was time to eat and unwrap. Sad day. We did realllyyy enjoy the kombucha on tap though and highly recommend trying it! You can also purchase and fill growlers there as well!

I think i would be down to go back again and maybe try the place out for lunch!<//text>< Pictures>

I tried this sandwich place today coz I read good reviews about it, but it's overrated. They put so much mustard on it that all you taste is the mustard. I got the pastrami sandwich and my friend got another kind of sandwich and with so much mustard both our sandwiches taste the same.< /text>

Except for the TERRRIBLE MUSIC they play here, this place is amazing.  The sandwich counter is one of Highland Park's hidden gems.  They have Kombucha ON TAP with CBD infused brews!  Like come on.  Amazing.

The music playlist feels like it was made by a 14 year old girl tho.</text>

Indoor and outdoor  seating. Best sandwiches around. The only bummer is that the there  isnot enough street parking.  I wish they had a parking lot.  The re are vegetarian, vegan and  many meat options. Interesting  selection  of cheeses.  I like that it is inside the tropicana food market.  I grab drinks ,chips and a dessert  depending  on my hunger level. I love the red dragon  sandwich because  it's  flavorful and filling.  The blt i hear is good because  the bacon is applewood smoked.  If you follow them in Facebook   you will get mouthwatering  pictures  and  descriptions  of their take home dinners and lunch sandwiches.<//Text>

{'time': 1477612800076, 'text': 'Our "rustic, millstone, whole wheat- sourdough" is made by the top rated bakery in all of Los Angeles. We have to order the sourdough-wheat" two days in advance because they make it in the most authentic and natural way to make sourdough. It takes time. We also have to order it 5 times more often than all of our other breads because it is, by far, the most popular.\nI\'m really sorry that you were so frustrated about this. Typically the BLT is only $7 but you ordered it with avocado so that\'s why it went up to $9.\nIf you want to remove this review of one star, I\'d be happy to give you another BLT on the house with one of our other breads. We also offer a white bread with 5 different types of seeds and a delicious rye (which is my favorite). If that still doesn\'t strike your fancy we have an amazing sub roll (better than subway (trust me)) and a brioche bun.\nSo come on back if your feeling kooky.'}< /resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Going to the dentist is rarely a pleasant experience, but Dr. Jacinto makes it the most pleasant it can be.  Her and her staff are friendly and accommodating.  I had some MAJOR work done recently (please don’t judge), 8 cavities done over two different appointments.

The doctor is knowledgeable, thorough, and is constantly checking to make sure you as the patient are comfortable.  Happy to have found this dentist in my area.  10/10, but don’t want to come again if I can help it, other than a checkup :-)</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhBM9mC2oxt5DTedUugRKWDJqc0W_BxFN_4PFl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Quick, painless and friendly. The best solution to the dentist equation. Was referred to her by my parents and even though the location is not close to my home, I still make the trek every three months for a cleaning. I pay more going that often but it's so worth it and her prices are reasonable. The office staff is great as well!  I've referred several people to her!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I was referred to Dr Jancito by my parents and brother have been going for years, now I have been going to this office for more than 2 years now!

We all love her and everyone at the office. The work is great, professional, and she really takes care of me! We're currently working on my Invisalign and can't wait to see the results :).</review><rate>5<//rate>< gmapID>

<Text>Dr J delivers great value for her work. No nonsense, always on schedule, always happy with the work she and her staff does. Also hooked up with a great independent insurance program that helped bring my last round of dental work down to a very reasonable price. I'm glad I found my LA dentist :)< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My favorite dentist ever...I can tell Dr. Jacinto is a dedicated pro. She explains the work she is doing, very good and confident you can tell.  I've not wanted to go to any other dentist since I started with them in the mid 90's and continue to stick with her because of her professional and very good service, work, and her office staff is solid...They all have been together since day one.  Tells you when you see the same faces for over 20 years!</Text>< pics>

Dr. Jacinto is the best dentist I have ever gone to.
She works efficiently, quickly and there is almost never any pain.  She always has very modern "high tech" dental equipment.  The staff is very pleasant; and doesn't make mistakes.< /Text>

I have been going to Dr. Jacinto for the last eighteen years now she's kind, gentle and and a very caring dentist. If you have a fear of going to the dentist try Dr. Jacinto she will make sure that you feel comfortable. In addition her staff is very helpful and caring as well.< /review>

Everyone on staff is professional and they give you the sense that they actually care, which, they do! Dr. Jacinto is also a dentist you can trust, I feel assured that the work she feels I need is always necessary. I've been to dentists in the past that made me feel like they were diagnosing me with a BUNCH of unnecessary procedures. This never happens here.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< name>

Great free toilet and place to hangout! Free WiFi. Charging places. Good location. If you order complicated drink you earn street creds as progressive dork.<//text>

< Review>
I don't go to Starbucks often because it can be a little pricey but when I do I really enjoy the coffee. I decided to try a cold brew sweet cream vanilla coffee drink that my daughter likes and it was really good. It wasn't as expensive as a latte or mocha and it was ice cold, refreshing and a nice pick me up.< /Review>

< Review>
The store is filthy inside and outside. Was there for over2 hours. Nobody wiped down any counters. People spilled drinks and they didn't even clean it. Garbages are completely full. No creamers. Customers had to ask for more. I called and they told me they just took out trash. Not so..< /Review>

Starbucks Forever!! Venti Caramel Machiato, kids temp, extra caramel. What else on Earth is better to start your day. I've had good days. I've had bad days. Yet I've never had a day that didn't get at least 20% better simply going to a Starbucks. If you need an opinion about Starbucks because you've never been- you must be from Neptune or something. Starbucks is just shy of a cult following, but count me in! Love, love, love starbucks! Maybe just a lil too much? Everyday Starbucks addict? Maybe just a lil. Lol. JUST GO!<//Text>

<review>Terrible service, unfortunately the girl who took our order at the drive thru has the worst customer service she was rude, unhelpful when we took our order and pushed us through the entire order constantly asking is that it? She also didn't give us a total until the window and did not inform us that they discontinued the child's size drink and on top of that she was in such a rush she forgot to give us our entire order. Plus when we asked for a refund on the drinks she was super rude also, we asked for one drink to be split for our 3 and 5 yr olds she repetitively told us they don't have kid size drinks and they put a smoothie in a am hot cup without straws!!! really!??
absolutely the worst<//review></record>

My drinks are always at least an inch or two empty before I even take one sip. This branch has absolutely lost me as a customer I refuse to pay $6 for less than a drink. Absolute bullshit.</Text>

<Review>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, yet expecting different results...and right now, I feel I must be going crazy, because I keep coming to this convenient location and expecting the experience to be positive.  I have honestly lost count of the number of times my drink has either tasted bad, or the order was wrong, or a number of other small irritating things have occurred.  The only consistency that I have experienced here is that the baristas have shown a consistent lack of care towards their customers.  Each time I go to this location, I question myself - is the covenience of the drive thru worth the poorly executed drink and careless attitude if the baristas?

To be fair, there are maybe two great baristas there - but the majority of them seem to be pretty unhappy, and as a result, the service ends up sucking.  I don't know why.  Perhaps it's a management issue?  Either way, it seems to be a perfect example of "water seeks its own level".  They are uniformly unpleasant or incompetent.  It's like, if Starbucks had a hell, this location would be Purgatory.

Here are only a few examples:

I have overheard one of their regular baristas - an extremely thin young man with pale complexion and spiky hair - actually encourage the barista at the drive thru window to lie to a customer who was behind me ("Just tell her it's decaf, she won't notice."  I happen to have a friend who is extremely sensitive to caffeine, and its disturbs me to know that the workers here have no qualms about potentially hurting someone).  I have had that same barista lie to my face and insist - after I returned an incorrect order to them and repeated my original request - that there was no difference to the cost between the two items (when their menu shows there's a 35 cent difference).  They have added things to my beverages (sweetener when I have requested none) or given me completely different drinks than what I ordered ("iced grande mocha" is very different from "matcha green tea Frappuccino").  Baristas rarely give receipts and are immediately dismissive of the customer after they've handed out the drink order.  Often the drink tastes weak, bitter, or just plain old (similar to sucking on coffee grounds).

It's been two years of sucking...and I know I keep saying this to myself, but convenience be damned: this is, by far, consistently the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to...and I will not return.  Just bought yet another fetid, oddly viscous coffee from there, and I'm NOT GOING BACK. I had to throw out the last two, and this one is heading for the trash as well.

If you want to know of a location that is amazing and makes drinking Starbucks a treat, consider Safeway on Bell Rd in Auburn.  Despite being a grocery store location, their coffee (and the service) is consistently excellent.  I also think the drive thru on Foresthill exit is awesome, asbis the Target Bell Rd location.< /Review>< Response>

<review>Don't go to mechanic here, they literally will try to scan you. First of all they dont have any fixed price list, they will literally charge you how much they can or just by looking on you. Once I called them and asked how much is it to mount 4 wheels is and got a price of 30 for wheel, when I came it magically went up to 250 for four wheels!! What is more after my oil change they magically found bad breaks and more problems that weren't confirmed at the other locations. No work ethics, just trying to scam people for money.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>The person working here is always rude. Most gas stations let you fill up air and water for free they don't here. Gas is always more expensive than the place two blocks down the road. even if you wanted to fill up air and purchase something at the gas station unless it's gas they won't help you. Human decency has really taken a dive at this place.</review>< userid>

< Review>
Outrageous Gas Prices Compared to All other Chevrons in the local vicinity . Their super is 50cents MORE PER GALLON at times! WTF. I can accept 5 cents difference but these 🤡are price gouging I'm guessing they're independent bc all the others I've asked are regulated by the main office at 4.35 gal. Recently gone up to 4.45 at all the other locals but here its 4.60 gal super-down from 4.79gal.when all others were at 4.19gal a few weeks ago.🖕👎👋</Review>

I like this place a lot! We come here to be our fleet car cleaned before inspections every 6 weeks or so and it never disappoints. Plenty of space to maneuver your vehicle and reach the pumps. Pretty fast fill on most of the pumps here and the customer service (at least in the gas station side) is warm and courteous.

I once cleaned out the car and left my basketball out by the car wash. Coming back two nights later to try and locate it, I was delighted to find out that they had held onto it for me in the shop. The car wash is nice and cheap and does a pretty good job of cleaning all the vehicles I bring into it.</Review>

I asked for a wheel alignment which I received and when I went to pick up the car I was told that I need new front tie rods, inside and out and new rear control arms  which he estimated at $380 amd $480 respectively.  I always take my car to the same mechanics so I declined and asked them to check on the above.  They found nothing wrong with either and also mentioned that if it needed those items I would have had to get a while new alignment afterward.  In otherwards, this guy is a crook.  Beware.<//review>

< Review>
The Mechanist is a CROOK! He does not say that the cost of work will be separately calculated for the oil change! For all, the price already includes the cost of the work, and this mechanic decided to deceive me and not say in advance that the work is separate! As a result, an oil change of $ 126 - I always and everywhere pay $ 40 for this !! DECEIVERS!</Review>

After being on the road with 3 kid (9, 6, and 1.5) for 2 hours we pulled into the Chevron station around 11:30pm.  I spent $80 fueling my SUV when we decided this would be a good bathroom stop.  I took the kids to the restroom where we were confronted by an employee holding a mop.  The employee stated "Sorry I just closed the restroom."  I asked very nicely (almost pleading) if he would allow the kids to use the restroom.  He then glared at me and said "Can't you hear IT'S CLOSED." Opened the restroom door and went in locking it behind him.  Great customer service here!  Hope someone shows you where you can stick that mop handle.< /review>

<Text>CARWASH code WARNING: I pre-paid for a car wash but on the day I purchased it, the line was 3 deep, so I decided I would come back later.  Well you only get 5 days where the "code" to the car wash is valid before it expires.  I returned after the expired date and Chevron wouldn't honor the car wash receipt.  I will not be returning, paying $12 for a car wash you didn't get is terrible.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Lawrence is a crooked mechanic at this Chevron. Estimate was $440 to change a serpentine belt on a 22yo Chrysler. We told him not to do any work until we came down. When we showed up with a tow truck and my vehicle was on a rack. He wanted $50 for diagnosis to bring the car down. I had to persuade him NICELY! The tow truck driver said he pulls cars from that station all the time. Learn from my mistake.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Father Ambrose and Father Lawrence are awesome.
If you need spiritual help call the front office and make an appointment to see Father Ambrose. I respect these men for the sacrifice they,'ve made to help guide our Souls to Heaven.</review>< response>

There's social distancing safety in the amount of people they let in at once. As always a wide variety of discounted quality products. Would have been nice if they added another cashier given the length of the line at checkout</Text>

This is a two story Ross, so it has a lot to look at. There's an elevator and carts on both floors. The selection is good, but some organization and arrangement is needed in some isles. I wanted to buy a sponge holder for the kitchen sink and had to look around the shelves to find the suction cups that went with it. I got on my hands and knees and finally found it underneath. Some products don't have price tags, so the manager ballparks a price. It's a good chance to haggle ;)<//Text>

Tried to return a perfectly new garment with receipt and tags attached but the horrid associates Angelita and Bernadette did not follow Ross policy and except the return saying that it had to be returned at the exact store purchased from which is not Ross policy< /Review>

I love that you can get some great products for a lower price as long as you're flexible on style, color, etc. I went on a Sunday night, which isn't the best time because many sections of the store have been picked over and people leave things in piles so it's not easy to find what you need. For example, I needed shower curtain hooks. No big deal, right? Things were pulld off the hooks and left in disarray. No wonder their employees are always straightening up the shelves. Overall though, a positive shopping experience. Watch your prices. Not always the very best.< /Review>

This place is hit or miss sometimes. You have to dig through everything to hunt out good deals. Sometimes the variety is pretty slim. They are open late and work in a pinch when you need something. Checkout can be slow but it's the same everywhere nowadays and I expect that. Worth a look if your in the shopping center.</Review>

This is one of the junkiest Ross stores I have seen.  It looks more like a Goodwill or Salvation Army store.  The shelves aren't full or tidy.  Many displays are more than half empty with random products.  There are few employees on the floor if you need assistance.   Maybe this is a sign of the times as a result of rampant shoplifting and constant store staffing cuts.</Text>

If you find what you need, perfect. I find very good cookware there as a cheap price. Sometimes a wait at checkout. Free parking.<//Review>

Always awesome deals to find at Ross. It's a must visit place whenever we visit the USA. You can get branded items for a fraction of the regular price elsewhere. Cannot wait for our next visit to Ross< /Text>

<review>I bought a $139 check-in suitcase from Ross dress for less San Francisco store one week ago. After measured it at home, I realized it was 2" larger than the airline required. I tried to return this brand new one to this store since it is closer, with receipt , name tag as well as all the accessories. Since I haven't used it, everything was at its original package and condition. I also wanted to bought a slightly smaller one as well as a carry on one. The overall $ amount was more than the return $. However, the cashier refused to return it and asked me to return it to the San Francisco store. I requested to speak with her manager. The she called and only told the manager its price and I bought it from SF store. The manager refused to return it as well. Then she found an excuse and said that it had been used! I had to bring it the SF store. The cashier there checked it and returned it without any doubt.

I felt it was their hidden return policy in-between different stores.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My sister and I went there to look for some household goods and bedding, but they didn't have a big selection for the bedding. We were a little disappointed, but we did find some sandals and candy/chocolate.< /Text>

I've seen clothes falling off of the racks, completely disorganized, on several occasions. The shoes will rarely be in the correct size racks. Often times the dressing rooms will have clothes strewn about, ignored by whoever is supposed to clean them.< /text>

I shop at Ross almost once a week and I went in yesterday with my niece and Gloria the manager was so rude. I can't believe you would have someone like that representing the store. I top of it everything is so unorganized and every time I ask someone if they have something they just say no because they don't wanna spend the time looking through the store. After my horrible experience with Gloria I promise to never step foot in a Ross again.</review>

< Review>
This is a huge 2 story Ross.  Despite its large size, the selection is still pretty limited.  Pro tip, park in the attached parking garage in back to avoid the hassle of the strip mall parking lot.</Review>

<Review>The selection is mediocre compared to other Ross stores. It sometimes feels like they're letting inventory run low because they are going to close that store down. Then they get more merchandise in, but as I said, selection isn't great. The bedding and rug areas are always a mess too. The reason I gave them a third star is because they stay open later than the other stores.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>
