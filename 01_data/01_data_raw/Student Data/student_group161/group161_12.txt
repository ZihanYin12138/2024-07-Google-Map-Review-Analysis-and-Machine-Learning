The helpful staff will give you some quick lessons and let you go out it for a while. If they see you struggling don’t give you some tips until you get it right. The place is in a nice location because it’s right on main street but downstairs you can order food or beer from the bar. It’s reasonably priced we started out with just doing a half hour but ended up paying for another half hour. It’s about 10 bucks for every half hour but they always let you finish your game if you go over.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTZy6naizy0DUksSCm1dwa6Fc-nKLANvWlC8lz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXKEzoZXdPbeWdQzxCze4G1qOg5_Ij2Km22d5a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND7qvKyFsiCYYfNBDIUvrt7145lFn8suKNqA4A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv7Sfxe8FH0yx8tubco5cwaEwUzAbTBREwDR32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMBSoiIZZ7t7HdNXpuk78CkvPCPNZP3jNnY7Rf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDGHUHHQqMsT0A3mOFZNMbNVaFLCOw6UmMGS3a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_rhx8c2QS2e5mDMMWyVB0of-ChNzag7Km69-X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhTKVDvESrYBJ5AXbkh03MRjEuKvFRVHo_ao8K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPucpY_vwC-vsMPMfwgXK85iEUQxikv0JtlvViq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMreRQxuqxnn5O7-ZzolSKMiJ-VJU-eHAvVsXBa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I am glad I was able to experience this with two other friends. We had a terrific time. Good music and atmosphere. The workers were nice and welcoming. We hope that in the future they would offer a variety of alcohol since not everyone drinks beer. Another thing would having some hooks or hanger for our purse or other items.. Other than that we will definitely go back and bring more friends.</text>

Everyone couldn’t stop talking about how unique the place is. They didn’t require masks which was the reason why we chose this place. The people who worked there were really nice and on it!

<text>Fun experience. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. One star off because they only give you one axe, which makes the process somewhat tedious because you have to retrieve your axe after *every* throw. Even the most basic, non-professional axe throwing experiences I've had gave you 3 at a time, so don't tell me it wouldn't work. Still had fun.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I will definitely be telling everyone i know to head there and throw some axes I had such an amazing experience. My boyfriend and I are absolutely going to make it a date night every chance we get.

We had so much fun Axe throwing. It has a great atmosphere and we will definitely go again. The only complaint we had was the board. We started off with a pretty shredded board. The bullseye was basically gone when we started  and it became very difficult to get the axe to stick at all. Still a good time, just hope we get a fresher board next time we come in.< /review>

I naively expected they would keep folks far enough apart, but they really aren't doing much for public safety. They clearly have a lot more space they could be using behind a curtain in the back- it's absolutely possible for them to space people out adequately. The place has good airflow so at least there's that structural risk reduction. I'll go back when I'm okay with exchanging fluids with strangers.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809addcd6f20415d:0x50c8d90cadabce5d<//gmapID></record>

This place was awesome!  Very welcoming and it’s open!! Took our 4 boys to do something besides sitting in the house and had a blast. Will definitely be coming back. The owner Susie was extremely friendly and even gave my younger sons some tips and advice on their swings that made a huge improvement on their throws. The instructor Collin was also extremely friendly and instructed us in a way that was easy to understand. Takes a minute to get comfortable with your swing, but once you do it’s a blast. They offer Beer, Wine, and sodas. They also have a kitchen I think, however we didn’t eat. I saw some people ordering from restaurants and having it delivered too. It’s also next to a brewery which is convenient. They also have a large back room that is open for private parties. Can’t wait to go back.< /review>

We enjoyed our second trip to Smart Axe and introduced some friends and my two 14-year-olds to axe throwing. Everyone enjoyed themselves. We have only had beverages there (haven’t tried the food, yet). Definitely recommend for a different spin on date night or a group outing.< /Text>

<Text>This was a LOT of fun. My 12 year old daughter and I had a blast learning to throw. Took some time, but we both got pretty good in our 75 minute slot, with some bullseyes🎯. Didn't try food or drinks, but definitely worth for throwing. If you are COVID cautious,  you should know that NONE of the waitstaff/employees where wearing masks. Most of the patrons were also sans masks. There is some room, so you aren't on top of other groups, but this is definitely not for anyone living with sensitive individuals.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoPZcucT8vsOiiXNDUEEWnYoyA2ZFihmhQ5OmW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

It's a good time throwing axes. There's a new brewery next door with much better drinks than they offer at their little bar. Oh and none of the staff members were wearing masks which is reckless. But if you're into safety, you probably wouldn't spend your free-time throwing axes at a bar.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Had a super fun night with our immediate and extended family at The Smart Axe (Folsom location). In these crazy times it is difficult to find something to do out and with a group but this was perfect! We had 2 lanes side by side for an hour (which was plenty of time for us). We were all beginners but by the end of the hour everyone had a decent to excellent understanding of what it takes to successfully get that axe to hit and stick in the board! There was an arcade with pinball, air hockey, and other games adjacent to add to the night. Restaurants were open for take out and shops along Sutter Street were open as well. If you are looking for something fun for the entire family to do give The Smart Axe a go!< /review>< Pics>

<text>Found our new date night spot!! Such a fun and friendly environment! The owners and staff are so helpful with tips on throwing and make sure you are taken care of and have a great time. Definitely recommend this place for a fun date night or a night out with a group of friends! Can’t wait to go back (and maybe join in on their league play)!< /text>< Rating>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Super fun, a little crowded in the back because you share a tiny table with another lane and there wasn't enough space for all of us to stand around freely let alone sit (4 in our group and 2 in theirs) but otherwise we really enjoyed it.  The teriyaki skewers were delicious!< /Text><userid>118255224959841518794<//userid><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

This is such a fun activity!!! Arm got a little sore the next door, but it was worth it. Competitive streak showed itself  😂
Hanging out at the Brewery next door afterwards made it complete.<//Review>

We had a great time at Smart Axe! One hour was PLENTY of time for our group of 4. We mostly played the corn-hole game. This was all our first experience at an axe... arena? 😂 We will be coming back for sure! Thank you Smart Axe team for making our experience easy and fun!<//text>

Went for the first time last night and had a great time!   Staff is very nice.  Very open and easy to talk with,  ask questions,  and find.  Building/ bathrooms,  very clean.  Great group of people all participating and having fun. I would've liked a broader selection of music;  I wasn't into what they were playing, but it didn't diminish the fun.  Maybe some metal next time?  Lol can't wait to come back< /review>

My friend and I walked 5 minutes before. Donny(ie?) Greeted us,.made sure we filled out our forms, made sure we had water and took us to the lanes. Stepped up and showed us how to safely handle the axes, and checked in on is several times throughout to make sure we were having fun.

There was absolutely 0 pressure to buy a bunch of drinks or snacks while we were there.

The atmosphere was laid back, super fun, and I'll definitely be coming back regularly<//Review>

My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out and we are definitely going back again! You have to at least try it once otherwise come and enjoy the drinks, snacks, and games! I can’t wait to show my friends and family from Arizona. It seems hard but it’s really not. The owner Doug showed us and by the time we left we were making the middle target 🎯  It was so much fun!!<//review>

This place is AWESOME!!  I missed them serving beer by one day, but who cares.  The employees were AMAZING!!  Super friendly, supportive and very knowledgeable.  I was lucky enough to squeeze out a couple bullseye a...no I didnt cheat.  I WILL be going back very soon, either by myself or with friends.<//Text>

<Review>I really enjoyed my visit here. Axe throwing was really fun, and I'm glad there's finally a place near me which provides it. The staff were amazing. When I went, the place was almost empty, and we were allowed to expand over two lanes since there were not many other people there, and we were often offered drinks and tips on how to throw. I'm definitely coming back :D<//Review>< pictures>

We love Smart Axe! The staff is always incredibly knowledgeable and take the time to show you different throwing techniques and answer any questions you may have. The staff is so friendly! I’ve come here three times and each time, the facility and atmosphere get better and better. We can’t wait to come back again!< /review>

First time going axe throwing... and it was awesome! It was pretty chill, we had a group of 6 and we all got to throw on one lane, grab some snacks, and chat with the manager Donny. We will be coming back again soon!<//Review>

This is an experience I have been looking for  for awhile now. It was fantastic. I was a first time thrower but they walk you through proper form for double handed and single handed throwing. I’m telling everyone.</Review>

Ive been coming to this place since highschool, 2007 and onward, workers changed and so did the prep times for orders, it all depends really, everyone has issues but it's no excuse to bring them to work. But I order online most of the time now, so I'm fine. They could use a trash bin here tho.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Employer (sylvia) gives me a day and time to show up and never showed so I talk to the staff working and they had to call her phone. The information I get back is that she's not showing up and with no reason to give me. She said leave my work permitt with her and and Sylvia will "probaly" be here to sign it tomorrow. So I asked can you call her right back to make sure that "probably" is certain because I can't just leave you my documents depending on you when there's other places that needs me. So she tells me to come tomorrow same time rather I leave my permitt with them or not .. I decided to take my permitt with me and just come tomorrow, before I show i wanted to call so that im not wasting my time AGAIN. no one is answering its been a problem since DAY ONE. I am very much in shock. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL !<//Text>< pictures>

The Wings are really good, my go to place. The staff is always friendly and professional when I deal them.

Bad location! Horrible parking and dangerous to get in and out of. Today I spent 10 minutes on hold trying to order and they never got back to me. Really hit and miss at this location where service is concerned for call in orders. Sometimes they never answer at all.<//Text>

I called in a order ( 10 wings ) and was told 18 minutes. I arrived 40 minutes later to wait 10 more minutes. The cashier was slow and wanted to have full on conversations with everyone. I get to work to eat my 10 wings and they didn’t give me ranch dressing or napkins. They did provide me with 4 forks. Yeah because I always eat bone in wings with a fork. I think everyone working there is stoned< /Review>

I come into this restaurant a couple of times during the month the serves has been pretty great. I am always helped as soon as I walk in. It is always very clean and the stations in the back are also clean. There is one person I just want to thank for always doing the most when I am there her name is Mikayla. I am always seeing her clean and she always has such a great attitude. Keep up the good work. I could see someone like her being great as a manager if she is not already.< /Text>

Their wings are sub standard, and their chicken strips are worse than Denny's, but their fries are pretty good. This location's wait times have been between 35 - 60 minutes, which is not worth the wait for some chicken I could get from Popeye's. tldr: Go anywhere else that serves chicken and it will taste better  with faster service.</Text>

Very unpleasant experience. The parking lot is atrocious, their lights in the wingstop sign are out making it very difficult to find the place at night.  When I got inside I wasn't acknowledged for a good few minutes. I'm not some boomer who thinks the world revolves around me but I think some form of acknowledgement is needed  if an establishment is busy. Just a little "we'll be right with you" would have sufficed. Anyway. 2/10 Would not go again.<//text>

The wings are bomb, but the location ain't the best. It serves some good wings and ok fries. The place is well decorated and themed very well, but it's not the best for sit-down dining. The tables have a sticky leather cover and the place ain't so clean. Customer service works though. Go in for the wings. Go out to eat them. It's also kinda pricey too, and you can't get just wings.</Review>

I came in after work to pick up cheese fries for my daughter. I placed my order and waited over 20 minutes for cheese fries. When I went to the counter to inquire about my order, the gal at the counter who waited on me, didn't remember me or my order. Horrible customer service</review>

Placed a phone order and they told me 25 minute wait. I waited. One hour later still not ready. It took over an hour just to get my  tiny order. Still haven't fixed their oven so still no rolls, months later. This location sucks! (65th expressway) I wouldn't give any stars.< /text>

I always choose Wingstop over fire wings because of the fries... but the food was not hot, nor was my order complete... I called in and my order took twice as long as estimated. All of this is forgivable but I didn't appreciate how the manager or shift leader spoke condescendingly towards her workers. I felt bad for them 🤷🏽‍♀️< /text>

Made online order came 25 mins after order and they hadnt started my order yet because the ticket fell on floor (figured that out about 5 minutes after I arrived).

This is another fave spot to pig out on fries, boneless nubs and other side. When I'm having that lowly day and need my food fix this hits the spot. The manager Des is super cool and hard working. The new counter girls are way more friendly.</Review>

I called here just now and sat on hold for 15 minutes on one phone then I called using my husbands phone to see if I got lost in the shuffle but I needed up being on hold for 30 minutes. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to swing by and to our amazement there was only 1 car in the entire parking lot. My husband then goes inside and the place was empty and the staff were sitting around. No orders were on, no one in line, and he shows them our phone that was still on hold. A girl came up with ear buds and says “oh I was in the back and he didn’t must have forgot to tell me.” Wow! Really?!? Then he asks for the manager and the manager just looked at him and didn’t say anything. Looks like we won’t be eating here. They need people who work there to have customer service skills!< /text>

Although my last order was wrong, I will still give this location a 5-star rating.. I've ordered from them close to 100 times and this is this first time they got it wrong.

Normally, the food is hot and fresh off the fryer. The staff is always friendly and they do their best to keep things as clean as possible but we are a college community and college kids are messy lol.

Now if only they could get my name right when announcing my order for pick-up.</Review>

<review>Let me start by saying I love Wingstop. That said, the service at this location is horrible!!!!! Regardless if i place my order over the phone or online my food is never ready on time. Today I placed my order there in the restaurant, the cashier told me 10 minutes. I waited 20+, 3 customers who order in the restaurant after I did all got their food before I did (my order was simple 10 piece boneless and regular fries). I told the cashier to refund my money and left.  This location is the WORST!!!!</review></record></dataset><record>

I called to order wings but they didn't honor their own corporate promotion. The woman was extremly rude and unpleasant. I asked about other specials. Then she hung up on me. This happened at 6:45 PM 9-12-18<//Text>

The customer service is not the best nor the location, it would be best if you just made the drive to Buffalo Wild Wings. So agitated tonight as we placed an order online to pick up and yet no one started on it... there goes 30 wasted minutes of my live.

Just avoid this location...< /review>

Great wings in many flavors! Parking lot is a bit of a pain to get in and out of, since it's right on the main road. Easy to pass it up.</review>

<date>1520815284365< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Called ahead because of parking being sucky. Told 20 minutes to pick up. Got there in 10. Person who took my order over the phone did not mention the road working going on in front of the whole corner of Broadway & 65th. When I asked why no one said anything about the roadwork. . . was told sarcastically. . "How do I know. . I didnt take the call".  Had to park about a block away and walk to the place. When I got back to car, fries were cold and undercooked. Wings were cold. The extra Ranch I paid for was all over the inside of the bag. Had I not had a bad set of knees which were now throbbing from having to walk so far to and from. . I would have taken the mess in a bag back and got my money back. The bag is still sitting on my kitchen counter. . too ticked off to sort through the mess to reheat the wings. Can't salvage soggy nasty fries. Not my finest experience with this location.< /text>< Pics>

The staff were nice, place was clean, but the boneless wings kind of sucked. Not the employees fault though, you could just tell the chicken came with no meat, all breading.</review>

Not a fan at all, I ordered a variety of wing flavors to go...I really wasn't impressed and asked that my French fries be hot...no hot fries, they were cold and soggy...they made me new fries but why couldn't they give me hot fries in the first place? Maybe they didn't think I would check? Not going back.</text>

Staff was awesome. The only reason this location doesn't get 5 stars is due to their terrible parking lot.</Review>

<Review>The food is great but the young group of people that work there rude and have no sense of sympathy for you when they screw your order up. Even if you drive 2 miles to your house like i did only to find out you have someone else's order. Love the food but if there were another wingstop in the area i would never go back to the one on 65th because of the employee's.</Review><user_name>Jermaine Mckinnie<//user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1359398797259< /Date><rating>3<//rating><gmap_id>0x809adabe0f578771:0xd45ddfa8088287c0< /gmap_id><userid>114025419084313893449< /userid>< Response>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) first, order online and spent 10min. the time I was in second, I missed 5 Boneless Wings to order and third call from home to say that I missed my 5 wings in order and was told that the chef said that if the Avia set. That annoyed me because VAT not waste my time if it was not true and after all not me restocked.

en primera, ordene por internet y se pasaron 10min. del tiempo que era, en segunda, me faltaron 5 alitas sin hueso que ordene y en tercera llame desde casa para decir que me  faltaron 5 alitas en mi pedido y me dijeron que el cocinero decia que si las avía puesto. eso me molesto pues no iva yo a perder mi tiempo si no era verdad y despues de todo no me las repusieron.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Dr Bederman has been my doctor since 2013. He did my surgery when he was affiliated with UCI. I followed him to Restore. He is an excellent surgeon & proved it with my surgery. Before him, I had surgeries with three other doctors but they weren’t able to do what he did for my spine. The results of his surgery improved my confidence about my body! I’m forever thankful to him. I’ll be having another surgery soon & am confident he will do another outstanding result. He truly is the best!< /Text>

Two years ago Dr. Bederman did surgery on my back. I was 74 years old and had adult on-set scoliosis. He straightened my back by fusing 10 vertebrae to 2 long rods with 20 screws. I healed perfectly and have no back pain. I wish I had known him when I had neck fusion surgery. It did not turn out as well. Dr. Bederman is very patient and kind. He takes time to thoroughly explain everything and answer all questions. I am not exaggerating when I say I think Dr. Bederman is a Miracle Worker!<//Text>

This facility is amazing. I’ve been delightfully surprised at the courteous staff,  cleanliness of the offices, ease of scheduling and in-depth knowledge of the doctors at Restore Orthopedics. Although I’m preparing for a very intricate spine surgery, iv been set to ease. My spine has been cut 5 times in various locations of the lumbar and cervical spines over the last 28 years only been one specific surgeon who made my function ability possible without a wheel chair or any assistive device. This will be my first time on the table with another spine specialist in the past 28 years. Since m prior surgeon retired,  was left needing someone to continue to carry the torch and provide me with specialized care and GOD provided Dr. S. Samuel Bederman. I’m still nervous about the two procedures but confident in his ability to be the tool God will use to keep me in service as his child. I can’t even consider being treated by anyone else nor would I choose to .</Review>

I don’t do many reviews but had to for Dr. Bederman. My daughter goes to him for her low dose EOS X-ray to monitor her scoliosis. He’s the only orthopedic doctor in Orange County that has the low dose X-ray in his office. He’s also very knowledgeable sincere and overall a great doctor! I would refer him to anyone and everyone! Thank you Dr. Bederman!</text>

The entire office staff are friendly and professional.  Scheduled appointment times happen in a very timely manner.  Both Dr. Bederman as well as his P.A. have really taken the time to listen to my concerns, answer all my questions and discuss with me all available options that lead to ridding me of pain and delivering optimum results.  I would not hesitate to recommend them to oversee the care of anyone in need.</review>

You are in good hands with Dr. Samuel Bederman, and with the facility where he provides his healthcare. The doctor takes the time to answer all your questions, giving you peace of mind that he can solve your medical issues. I could not walk 2 blocks without severe back and leg pain, after the surgery I’m back at the gym. The staff at the facility is always helpful, caring and courteous. The facility also has state of the art imaging services, pain clinic and an outpatient surgery center. The place is amazing!< /Review>

I'm beyond grateful for Dr. Bederman's abilities and my surgery result. I had bilateral sciatica pain that radiated into my calves. It's two weeks after surgery and that pain is gone! I've never felt this good and I have 6 more weeks until my surgery is "healed".
I live in Vegas, 4 hours away from Orange, CA, working with Dr. Bederman's staff to get my MRI's, X-rays , blood work, Covid-19 test and remote prep calls with the Dr was well coordinated and easy to do.
I can't think of anything that could improve my pre or post surgery experience. If you need this surgery, Dr. Bederman is the right choice. I would give 10 stars if possible.< /text>

Dr. Bederman is the finest spinal surgeon I could have ever been introduced to 10 years ago. Two surgeries later I'm still doing well. He is honest, experienced and a fine human being. I'm lucky I can trust my spinal problems with him.</text>

With age and sports my back had worn out.  As athletes, we tell ourselves to work through the pain... “no pain, no gain”.  By the time I was referred to Dr. B, my pain was a 8-9 when I stood up. I was bent over and looked crooked when I walked.  I was embarrassed, in constant pain and miserable.  Now six months later, I’m straight and walk normal, and my back pain is a 0.   He and his wonderful team saved my spine and gave me back a quality life.  Dr. B thinks out of the box, is very intelligent, patient, and has an excellent bedside manner.  He has a calm confidence that made me feel safe.  His office team was always friendly and helpful.  The office is very clean and professional.

My only complaint is the 40 minute wait in the outside waiting room.

The many doctors who couldn't, is one doctor who could, Dr Samuel Bederman.  I was very badly deformed for many years. Giving up on life, in chronic pain all the time and had no life. I went through nine botched surgeries before I met
Dr Bederman. It took Dr Bederman three different surgeries. But he got the job done. And he did something many doctors couldn't do, he did it right. He gave me my life back on a golden platter.
I'm living life to the fullest again. I'm back to doing everything I used to do before my injury. Most of all I've been completely pain free for over three
years now..
Thank you!!
Doctor Samuel Bederman, you will always be my hero..

Dr Bederman is the best!   Dr. bederman performed a lengthy lower back surgery on my in 2015 and I’m so much better!   I trust in him to do exemplary work always!   He did back surgery on my 30 year old son, again, exemplary work!    I also referred my friend and neighbor last year for the same neck surgery that I’m having in a couple weeks!

Again,  Sam Bederman is the best!

Thank you,

This man gave me my legs back! My spine is weird (I’ll spare you the details), and a slightly bulging disk nearly put me in a wheelchair. I went into surgery barely being able to walk, and when the hospital’s physical therapist came to see how much improvement there was after the surgery, I could run up and down stairs and bounce around!

I didn’t realize how much I’d lost in range of motion and general strength over the years. In the two years following I’ve had zero negative effects from the surgery, and I’ve gained strength and energy I didn’t realize I’d lost.

Things you should know:
- He is good at listening, but he is also very efficient and to the point, so bring your list of questions and things you want him to know about
- If you forget to ask something, he returns calls and is happy to answer questions
- He is brilliant, but not arrogant - I wanted to try PT first, and he honored that, but when things got worse, he encouraged surgery - I never felt pushed or intimidated
- They have X-Ray and MRI on site, so you might find yourself getting all your imaging done same day, or soon after
- His staff is great!<//Text>

We came from Oklahoma for Dr Bederman to perform a complex 3 part 5 hour surgery on my daughter’s back. He is a miracle worker. Explained everything really well prior to surgery, took his time and answered all our questions.  The day after surgery her back felt better than pre-surgery. Was up walking around within hours of the surgery. He is the best!!!!</text>

<Review>Dr. Bederman performed a microdisectomy on me in may of 2017.  One year later and the symptoms that required the microdisectomy are still held at bay.  Back surgery and recovery is about how good the surgeon is and how hard the patient works at recovery.  With Dr. Bederman, the technical ability to perform complicated spinal surgeries are second to none.  I got several second opinions before opting for the surgical route and they all agreed with the info that I was being given by Dr. Bederman.  Dr. Bederman was frank and honest with me, if not pragmatic, about the outlook for success for the surgery and he did not sugar coat the reality, which I appreciated.  I want my doctors to provide the facts and the outlook as they see it from their experience in the field.  I got exactly that from Dr. Bederman and I am pleased with the work he did and the result.  Now the rest of the battle is in my hands to make sure I stay fit enough to not need to see him on a regular basis.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9c51733eb11:0xb6ac25bef12d8dc3< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<text>Gotta give 2 stars for changing your hours to be closed on the weekend and not updating the hours. Just wasted a buncha time driving here for nothing. That said, best grow shop in the area. When they’re open!

Edit: how could anyone who works make it to this store to get what they need. Closed on the weekend and only open for 5 hours during the week. That’s no good.< /text><username>Ryan Bair< /username>< user_id>

This is my first year growing plants and was recommended to S. Bay Hydroponics by a good friend of mine. The service, prices and advice which I got from the store (esp Seth) was amazing!

Seth helped me set-up my garden step by step and gave me detailed instructions on what exactly I should do, what I should avoid and what the steps in the future will be. In addition to all the priceless valuable information he gave me, he also gave me a few discounted rates on some of my purchases and never tried selling me stuff which I may not have needed. I am so confident and pleased with the prices at S. Bay Hydro that I do not even need to go compare prices with other locations because I am that confident that this store has the best rates.

More than the pricing of their products, it is the quality customer service which has made me a lifelong customer to this store. Even if I do not need anything, I will make sure to drop by to see Seth once a week so I can give him updates on my plants and get feedback to any questions I may have. I believe what has made me so comfortable coming here and working with Seth is that I never feel he (they) is (are) rushing to answer my questions and always (emphasis on always) makes time to explain everything to me fully and in details.

I look forward to coming to this store every week and am very thankful I have found individuals who are so willing and passionate to help individuals like me! I would seriously be lost without them!

Thank you S. Bay Hydroponics and I look forward to touching base again soon!</review>

Best prices in the whole area... very knowledgeable and helpful staff... they spend time and answer all my questions and are just good people! I believe I was helped by Jr a few times now. First time ever spending my time writing a review in my whole life... i have been overly happy with each and every visit to the growbiz!</Text>

Seth and his staff at hydroponics are not only knowledgeable but you can tell they care about taking the time to inform you about all the products they offer.  I have spent many hours speaking with Seth and he has given me advice and recommendations that have been very helpful.  In addition the prices at South Bay Hydroponics are the lowest I have seen and they offer a discount just for signing up an in store account.  I highly recommend south bay hydroponics for new and experienced growers of all kinds.</Text>

I have been doing a lot of research online for starting my first grow. Came to South bay Hydro and was amazed by the amount of knowledge and time spent explaining tips and tricks that I should know for successful runs. Didn't try to "sell' me on anything and that, to me was the best part. I would highly recommend this shop and will be returning for my needs. Talk to Seth.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>A few weeks back my husband sent me South Bay Hydroponics to pick up some soil and fertilizer.  As I didn't remember exactly what he requested and wasn't able to get in touch with him at work I was a little nervous about coming home with the right thing.  Needless to say the staff at the shop was beyond helpful, answered all my questions, made recommendations and most importantly made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process.  I ended up getting exactly what he wanted and they also made a recommendation on a fertilizer that was even better than he originally requested.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back again and would highly recommend this place to newbies like myself!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Staff was blah blah they don't answer your questions all they say it's "there are a lot of options". They just do their job they don't help customers they talk faster and they are naive they don't respond to you to help you. Everything is expensive here and I really think no one would spend thousands (sometimes hundreds) of dollars for stupid trees or tree related stuff. Marijuana growers better goto other stores or order online. Staff has no basic idea of growing anything. It's not a customer friendly place they just want to bill you more even tho you wasn't there with your gf for shopping.< /Text>< userid>

The guys at South Bay are great! Nothing but positive experiences over there. If they don't have it on the shelves they'll get it in for you as quick as possible. Staff there is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. My go to spot for any of my hydroponic and general gardening needs. They go above and beyond to help their customers out for sure!<//review>

Seth, Jake, and Andrew all 3 of these fellas have been huge help for me, I came in not knowing anything and they stayed patient and helped me all the way through it. All 3 of them are very knowledgeable and have some hands on experience themselves, great place to come if your looking to start an indoor garden or expand the one you already have!<//text>

South Bay Hydroponics is one of the best Hydro places around the Bay. the customer service was Great. everyone in this place really knows what they are talking about. the prices are really good and they are willing to work with you... they ALL go out of there way to make sure u know what u need to know, to have a successful garden.. ONCE AGAIN! SOUTH BAY IS A GREAT PLACE TO GO, Great customer service everyone..

nvm what ppl say about waiting in line. you cant help it when alot of people come in and  it takes longer then 30 sec to get helped. i mean really get over your self and learn patience.. GREAT PLACE TO GO/</text>

Southbay Hydro is exceptionally well stocked. Jay and Seth are very knowlegable and friendly. I have also visited the Sunnyvale location which is great, but Bascom is by far my favorite. Remarkable staff! Remember, good customer service is key. Keep up the good work and get me on the list for the next grow show in frisco next year.

Thanks guys!

This cafe has plenty of outdoor seating and looks like a popular brunch spot during the weekends. We got their popular French Toast on Baguettes, which had a unique taste. I'm loving the berry jam! It goes well on a toasted and honeyed Baguette. The French toast wasn't too heavy and did not come with maple syrup.< /text>

Food: I order the Caprese Panini with Chicken and a side of Black beans. Juicey chicken breast, melted mozzarella cheese, tomato, basil, dressed in signature pesto sauce and between 2 toasted slices of bread. My favorite lunch item and the beans are a nice little touch to round the meal off. For dessert, I get the French Toast and it is s favorite among my friends. Lastly,  I get a Bloody Mary to help start my day.

Service and Atmosphere: The place is cute and pretty small but there is also outside seating. If there is a wait, stick around because the attentive and fast service will get you seated in no time.

Final Thought: I dig the place but some of the items can get a little pricey and the portions don't justify the cost. But it is a yummy and trendy place, so it is, what it is.<//Text>

Food is not good , hardly any flavor.
When they brought my food out they just left without asking if we needed anything.
I wanted ketchup and I kept waiting for our waitress to come but she just kept helping other tables and never once asked if we were ok.
I finished my sandwich still wanting ketchup and she never came.
We waited for check for extra 15 mins after finishing our food and no one came to our table.
Eventually we just went up to ask for our check paid and left.< /review>

<review>No idea what happened to this place. It used to be good, but recently they messed up my last 5 orders. They forgot to add things (like coffee) and take things off (like pico). They also made the completely wrong thing for my partner. Because this was take-out, we had to go all the way back and wait for them to re-make it. Not good anymore....< /review>< Pics>

The restaurant has a charming feel with its 1920’s retro look. We went for breakfast and I ordered a Breakfast Burrito which was nothing out of the world but OK. The strawberry and Nutella Crepes were nice and come as a big portion. Overall, a very nice café.<//Review>< user_name>

<review>Great place for brunch on a Saturday morning.  Not too many tables so it fills up quick.  If you come before 9am on Saturday you should not have to wait, but any later and you'll expect a bit of a wait.  Food is good and you just feel good after eating it.  Not heavy at all.  Also the restrooms are clean and pleasant.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd5f62a616f39:0x533c7b01b3b3f060< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We love Rialto for the food and the service, but they also have a special place in our heart. When our dog was sick, we took her there with us for breakfast the day we had to say goodbye. The staff at Rialto were all so sweet and caring towards us, and they brought our dog all kinds of goodies to enjoy. We'll never forget your kindness.< /Text></record>

< review>
We love Rialto for the food and the service, but they also have a special place in our heart. When our dog was sick, we took her there with us for breakfast the day we had to say goodbye. The staff at Rialto were all so sweet and caring towards us, and they brought our dog all kinds of goodies to enjoy. We'll never forget your kindness.<//review>

Let me start off by saying that breakfast today was delicious and the service that came with it while I waited for my to-go order was also delightful. Came here Thursday morning to have some breakfast with my cousin. We waited about 20 minutes or so for two orders of pancakes with eggs and bacon. Here’s the reason why I chose 4 stars over 5. The eggs were well cooked and delicious as well as the bacon. Could have been crispier but had great taste nonetheless. The pancakes is where it fell slightly short. Although they had a good buttermilk flavor, when I cut them and dug my fork in, i had the top half on the fork and the bottom half ripped off and still on my plate. I thought it was interesting that they did this which definitely meant they could have used a bit more cooking. All in all, would definitely stop by for a taste. Their food has proven to be delicious.<//Text>

Nice and cute place for some breakfast, food was actually good. Potatoes or eggs and even chilaquiles were amazing. Overall worth the small wait. Will admit the waiting room is akward.<//Text>

Its small so expect to wait. HOWEVER, TOTALLY WORTH IT.  I had the breakfast burrito "becky style". So good. Wasn't greasy.  Wasn't over cheesy like they tend to be. Something so simple always has me asking myself "how can this basic meal possibly be ruined"... Yet, im often dissapointed. But this was really really really delicious. I had it with the side of potatoes, personally I dont care for potatoes and i always end up giving them to my boyfriend. BUT maaan, these were soooo good!! I couldnt stop eating them! So much food too. My boyfriend got the salmon and egg, that was delicious too! I had to try it because generally the salmon tends to be so salty. Not here. Just delicious. Oh, and the coffee. It was strong, couldn't ask for more. This is joint my boyfriend often goes to. But ive never been just cause the wait is generally long and I get hangry and turn into a little beast if i dont eat RIGHT THEN and THERE but lesson learned. Worth the wait!!! Staff is attentive, they're nice. Not like fake nice cause they work with customers, but they seemed like genuinely like nice people when they would interact with the customers<//review>

<text>Our hour-plus wait for a table was definitely not worth it. The food was less than expected, and the French toast was nothing like I have ever had before...and never will again. We went there because of all the great reviews, but cannot understand where the reviews come from. Obviously, I expect more from a breakfast. Also, the "egg-in-a-basket" left you waiting for lunch, and the crepes were lukewarm.</text><gmap_id>0x80dcd5f62a616f39:0x533c7b01b3b3f060</gmap_id>< rating>

Great little cafe! We stumbled upon it this morning and I’m glad we checked it out. The food was great! My wife got the French toast (delicious). If you’re looking for something unique, I recommend the Rialto Ranchero. It’s an interesting flavor profile that really works well together! Strong flavors, but well-balanced. They also serve Stumptown Coffee, which is really smooth. We will definitely be back!<//Text>

My boyfriend and I showed up on a Saturday morning-ish, around 11:30. We were told that it was a 30 minute wait. After some time (didn’t keep track but we were very hungry) we were offered to sit at the bar, we declined and were set on table seating. The restaurant itself is cute, nicely decorated and has a Wes Anderson movie playing on a tv behind the bar.
After getting seated and being served a glass of water (we had gotten coffee while waiting for our table) we were then informed that they were out of the breakfast potatoes and the eggs Benedict (and a couple other items) this was around 12-12:30.
The entire reason for visiting this particular place is because the eggs Benedict were so highly praised, so to say the least we were disappointed.
Instead I ordered the Wilshire omelette with hash browns (other option would have been breakfast potatoes) my boyfriend ordered the quiche of the day which happened to be the Wilshire quiche.
Our orders arrived quickly but the eggs in my omelette were significantly over cooked and the quiche was very spinach heavy and the dough was undercooked.
Our main disappointment stems from the fact that the two main dishes we wanted were sold out before we were seated. Had we known this we would have eaten somewhere else and avoided waiting 30 minutes and eating over cooked eggs.</Text>

Rialto Cafe is a popular Breakfast / Brunch Cafe in Downtown Fullerton. It's capacity is about 40-50, so yes it's small, and yes it's popular, so yes you will have to wait. You can't rush people to finish their food, pay and leave. On the other hand, when you do sit down and are paying for a service, you should be served in a appropriate way. The food should come out in timely manner, and yes you shouldn't wait to get your check cuz that won't help the ladder. That's what I experienced at Rialto today, the food is delicious, got the Smaoked dsalmon scrambler and eggs Benedict, both good. I would have them again, but yes I agree with the negative feedback about the service. It's a bit slow, the food takes a long time to come out and they maybe under staffed.

If you don't mind the wait but do want to enjoy some good food them give them a try.<//text>

Among best cafe's I've been to. Music was top notch downtempo/jazztronica, and they had a movie from studio ghibli on the monitor! Epic aesthetics with excellent the food and service.<//review>

Good food, especially breakfast. Can be pretty busy and is loud at times. But still Rialto is one of my favorite restaurants in DT Fullerton.</review>

<Text>June 18,: I wish we had the names of these serious servers because they were really great ) We met our friend from Atlanta before the rodeo at the Rialto adjacent to the Marriott where he was staying. It was happy hour and really busy but we managed to get 3 seats at the bar next to the service bar. The young woman who was bartending acknowledged me immediately and took our order immediately. Happy hour menu was super reasonable and that’s what we had for dinner. A couple of orders of steak tacos, some ribs, some calamari. All well prepared and tasty. The ribs were dry rubbed which I like much better than having sauce drip all over. When she was getting crazy busy another young lady bartender came over and offered our refills without us having to ask. We returned after the rodeo for a nightcap, the cocktail waitress was really nice, brought water without being asked ( she must have read my mind) and was prompt with drinks, refills and had such a fun personality. Although it was closing time and she was cleaning up and doing her side work at the tables she never rushed us to leave. We live north of Denver and of course, I used TripAdvisor to research where we were going to eat. Once I realized we were going to be short of time I noted that the Rialto was adjacent to the Marriott which would save us time and was convenient to the busses. The prices were extremely reasonable for downtown Denver and the food was darn good. If you are in Denver I highly recommend this place, we like to sit at the bar, there are many high top tables surrounding the bar which we sat at when we came back the second time and the bar was full. The dining room looked comfortable. The only thing that bothered me was the level of the music, it was really loud and made conversation slightly difficult for more than two so if I could tell the management to turn it down a couple of notches I would.<//Text>< UserId.>

<text>We arrived at Rialto Cafe around 2:00 on a Sunday. I wanted to try it out because of the positive reviews on Google and Yelp.
I wanted to order a bloody Mary but they were out of bloody Mary mix. Ok so maybe a beer nope they were out of that too. That should of been a sign to leave. So ended up ordering a screwdriver it was good. Now we wanted to order food. We ordered their famous french toast and Greek omelette. We waited for 45 minutes for our food. We did notice that the cook and staff were cleaning up since they close at 3:30. We kinda wondered what the hold up was 🤔. Well the chef was too busy to make our food order because he was ready to leave. So frustrating I had to ask one of the staff if our food was ready. Our food arrived at our table and I was surprised by the way it looked. The French toast was actually a French bread bagget cut in half. I could not tell if it was toasted or grilled. So disappointing it had no flavor except for the small portion of fruit on it. The Greek omelette was good.
For the wait time and price it was not worth it.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>This is my 2nd time here and the food never disappoints! The service here is friendly and efficient, the food is well thought out and cooked to perfection and the ambiance is awesome! The food might be a bit on the pricy side, but the portions are nice and seasoned quite well! This place is highly recommended!</review>< name>

This is a pleasant spot and a good place to spend a morning, but the menu is inconsistent. You can't go wrong if you stick to the basics, which they do well, but the "signature" dishes, like the breakfast crostini for example, are mostly ill concieved and though not exactly bad, not really worth the price. Still their omelettes and pancakes are decent enough, and it really does have nice ambience and a good sidewalk dining area.</review>

I've come here twice and never had a good experience. On my last and final visit, the hostess was stuck up with zero self awareness. I don't like to complain so I will just say, for a place that focuses more on being cute and hip then the actual taste of their food, they have really bad customer service and don't care that they do. I'll have to get my Stumptown coffee somewhere else.< /text>

Avoid it. Unless you're a hippy wannabe nerd that likes to spend 3X for food that deserves 1/10th the price. The morsels are tasty, but you are paying the owner's rent just to keep this hobby-job open. This is a break-even at best business.<//Review>

Let me by start off by saying that i am 100% Mexican. This is important because i am use to  having the best authentic stews such as; Pozole, Albondigas, caldo de pollo etc... Rialto Cafe has an array of mouth watering soups of the day. Best i have ever had...outside of my moms cooking! I have been there several times after my first visit a month ago, and i have had plenty of great experiences. See you soon Salmon with eggs!< /Review>

Atlantis is very narrow street. The gate is at the south end. They unload my trailer in one hour and 20 minutes. Clean yard. Friendly people.< /review>

<name>KVS Trans</name><review>We have been hauling Tesla loads for a while an this receiver used to be super cool and friendly. But something happened after quarantine. Either new management or something else. They became to be a very nasty receiver. They are by appointment only now, but at the same time they can change the appointment  anytime before your delivery time. No one cares and they are like sorry, reach out your broker or Tesla.< /review></record>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Maybe cause they recently reopen but there was a long line of trucks waiting to get unloaded.  Got there around 4am and left 7:30pm!!! Probably 20-30 trucks parked around the warehouse and outside on the street waiting. Old security guy at night is cool and also lady at the receiving office. Uber eats not deliver to this location, no restroom either. Overall, the whole day wasted and not so great experience.<//Text><Name>Joe Fisichella<//Name>< user_id>

I come here randomly on Fridays and Saturdays only for their 8PM to 11PM deal. The deal is great compared to just paying for a hour on some random day. The only problem some kids can be mean and take it too seriously in Douge ball where they start aiming for the head. Not only that the prices are WAY to expensive. Compare their food to some other area as little Caesar. But fun for the kids.< /Text>

<review>Amazing place to take the kids and family!  Lots of fun rooms for jumping, on trampolines and on bounce houses. Arcade games and cafe.  I wish the cafe  had a healthier selection, mostly pizza and candies, but it is still a great place to spend an afternoon and all ages will love it.  Must sign waivers before you are allowed to enter.  Allow time for filling it out before you go.  Staff is always friendly and a great place to have a birthday party.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great place for kids to run around wear put there energy. They have to have grip socks to be able to jump. It's a bit expensive. Food is good there. Some staff are young and not always keeping an eye what the kids r doing.<//text>

One twisted ankle and knee-in-mouth later, I wasn't in good shape. But the huge layout of trampolines is great nonetheless.< /review>< pictures>

It's pretty fun. I feel it could be more fun though. I was skeptical at first. When I first  drove up I felt like I was in the wrong place because it's in a warehouse but once I got in it was pretty fun. I don't like how they make you buy their own special socks. The food is also a little pricey.<//review>

This place is terrible! All the employees are rude and watch you like a hawk and will snap at you for the silliest things. Its incredibly awkward to have someone stare intently at you and saying "no, no, no! You can't do that!" Every 2 minutes. I am a mother with her two young children.. Not a group of unruly teenage boys. One employee told me I couldnt pick up my 1 year old. Then I got in "trouble" for taking a picture of my 3 year old jumping. Are you kidding me? We sign a waiver and even give you our address and license number plus you guys have cameras.. Is it really necessary to micromanage every person there? Will never go there again! Was there for a half hour before we had it. What a waste of $45! I think they are only happy if you just stand there and lightly jump in place.<//review>

Total party place for all ages.  The music is  bumping here and people of all ages can go on the trampolines.  An arcade is included and four different trampoline areas plus a foam pit and basketball hoops.  There's massage chairs for the parents and plenty of tables for parties to eat at.  Also party rooms.  If you buy a 10 pack of jumps, you will save $50 (aka $5 per jump session) which is 1/3 off.  Food is typical pizza, pastas, sandwiches and nachos.</review>

This place was and is a disaster.  They have teenagers supervising without the knowledge or experience to understand situations created between 16 yr olds and 10 yr olds. An older boy had 4 kids from our group crying. Nobody working here recognized 4 - 9 yr old boys bent over in pain, crying? This 16 yr old was verbally calling these boys flag and taunting them. Its only a matter of time that this place has a serious incident.<//review>

I loved it!! Especially dodgeball :) one adjustment Id make is to put the younger ones in a different area to play with one another so that the teenagers wont injur them.   Also, if you guys could make the dodgeball games more competetive to the point where if you get out you have to wait until the next round? Thanks!!😁</text>

This place isn't that great because first of all the people who work there are so rude. First of all, just because I was lying down for at least 5 seconds on the freestyle trampolines, they kicked me out and reduced my time for having fun. 2nd - On the basketball hoop I jumped high and slammed it down and I got into big trouble. Lastly, I injured my back doing flips on the trampoline. Some guy came up to me and double bounced me. I don't recommend this place. Also, they won't let us wear socks while jumping. They tricked us on the cost just because we have a different race.</text>

<Response>None<//Response><Pics>None< /Pics><Review>AMAZING place for the weekends. Iv'e been here as a teenager 20+ times, and I love it. I wouldn't say it's a GREAT choice for little kids, but it works out. For people my age, it's a BLAST. Dodgeball, good arcade games, freestyle jump (FLIPS!!), basketball dunking, snack shack, special birthday party floors, and a foam pit to practice. I'm pretty sure there's only been ONE time I've had an OK visit. A waiver must be filled out semi-annually, and grippy socks need to be worn while jumping, due to way too many injuries in the past of people slipping ($2 for one pair at the counter) Memories, skill-building, great times with friends.

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I bought a gift card from here but ended up not using it for it's intended purpose.  They flat out refused to issue me a refund of any sort telling me that that's the way gift cards work everywhere.  When trying to work out any sort of deal with them (buy something and cash out the rest or something similar) still refused.  Now I'm stuck with $45 gift card to this place. Thanks for not helping me in anyway.</Review>< pictures>

{'time': 1527725047919, 'text': 'Hi Warren,  We\'re sorry for your frustration.  Gift cards purchased here can be redeemed for jump time. Gift cards can\'t be redeemed for cash. This is a pretty standard policy for most businesses, but it\'s also important here because we offer a Gift Card Bonus program which gives a 10% bonus value on a gift card purchase over $50 - and a 20% bonus on gift card purchase over $100.  It\'s worth noting that you\'re $45 gift card is enough to take advantage of our "Family Night" special on Monday and Wednesday nights when a family of 4 gets 90-minutes of jump time, a large 1-item pizza and 4 bottled waters for just $39. We\'re all about family fun! Thanks!'}<//response>

The worst place ever, about a week ago I went to this place for the first time and will never go back again. The fact that the employees there are watching your every move is very uncomfortable and to make matters worse they laugh at what ever you do. RUDE</review>

You get to jump and gain more calories by eating pizza and there is anamotronics that move at night< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1513107359709, 'text': 'Hello Juan,  Eating our delicious pizza or any other tasty selection from the Cafe located within the facility is, of course, optional.  We are a bit puzzled by your reference of "anamotronics", since we don\'t have anything like that here.  However perhaps you visited on a Friday or Saturday "Cosmic Night" (from 8-11 pm, just $15 per person for the 3 hour period)  when the regular lights are turned off, the music is turned up, and the black lights glow throughout the facility.'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80e8497feda217c3:0x89443a84baa99ccf</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wanted to let you know that there are many ways to save off of our standard rates, including:  Daily Specials (every day of the week offers some type of special -- including deep discounts on weekdays during school year); we have a "Slam Dunk Saturday" special running right now (just $12 for 2 hours of jumping between 1-4pm on Saturdays); Cosmic Night each Friday and Saturday from 8-11pm is just $15 for the 3 hour period; we have a "Spring" Birthday Party Sale running this month;  we also have a "VIP Mobile Rewards Club" where you can earn free jumping and get exclusive deals sent right to your phone (simply enter your number at one of the Loyalty Kiosks on our front counter). Details on our many specials can be found on the "pricing and specials" page at www.cam.skyhighsports.com  Thanks!'}<//resp>

<Review>Taking Advantage of People. Down in the area today.  Trying to buy as much take-out as possible since so many business are struggling.  We jumped on google found this deli, looked at the menu with pictures on their website and ordered.  If you frequent any restaurant at all, you know the the real thing never looks like the picture.  However, this is very sad.  Their menu was limited which is understandable but when we got our sandwiches, I laughed out loud. The pictures say it all.  If you're in the area, spend your money at a location that will treat you like a valuable customer.< /Review>< Pics>

I drive for UberEats and I picked up an order from here. Since it is COVID-19 time they did have a set up. They had a table that said UberEats and I waited in line and still kept an eye on the table for my order . The guy that was there (Asian, glasses age 20-30) leaves a bag there with no name . I then grab the bag and ask if this is for “name” and he looks up and gives me a really ugly look and says “Yes” . It would be nice if they label orders and not just leave a bag there . I can’t take any order if I’m not sure . The guy was really rude after I asked a simple question ...</text>

I was there at 2pm, ordered sandwich, sat down to eat. Since they close at 3pm this lady started moping and vacuuming the half of the lobby which they close at 1.30. Which is understandable. But she came around and started vacuuming the  area where we were eating. I had to take a business phone call and i could barely hear anything, not to mention the vacuum spewing dust all over the place. Its was a bagless vacuum and looks like it came out of a pile of dust. QUIT VACUUMING WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE EATING! RIGHT NEXT TO MY TABLE !</review>

Turkey Pesto Melt is really good. It was a little small but also reasonably priced.<//Review>

Food is good.  But the new cashier isn't really inviting like the old cashier they had.  This guy never smiles.  And lazy.  Itll be nice if he tries opening his mouth more  when calling people when food is ready. Can't barely hear him.  But overall is okay.< /Text>

Bought their dustless concrete table saw three years ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product.  It does an excellent job collecting the concrete dust from cutting which allows us to stay OSHA compliant without having to cut using water.  We have had almost no issues with the saw and it has been extremely easy to maintain.<//Review>

This IQ dry cut tile saw was a great investment. Even though the cost may scare you but the time it saves by setting up in the room and not having a mess to clean up or power wash areas outside. With its own filter system it catches about 95% of the dust. I use a portable dust collector and that grabs the rest.

I cuts straight and clean cuts. Just not for glass.

I have recommended this to my other contractors and they have also picked it up. It is my go to saw for tile ,Porcelain tile, marble, everything but glass.

Love the product . It paid for itself in just 3 jobs not having to run up and down the stairs. Labor is costly and this saves me money.

Hands down the best dustless saw on the market. No more messing around with cheap aftermarket attachments that either don't last or work at all. No more expensive vacuum systems to drag around. Load and go as we say. Cutting made quick, easy and clean. Highly recommend for any hardscape project.<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>We purchased the iQTS244 saw last year and I wish we had purchased it years ago!!!   The amount of time that has been saved not having to go up and down stairs to make a cut or micro adjustment is worth its weight in gold.  It is so easy to set up.  We make sure to keep our blades dressed so they cut at optimal performance.  Now we just need to bite the bullet and purchase the new Cyclone!

The customer service team at IQ is amazing also.   Had a few questions on the first day we used the machine and our customer service specialist,  Berenice, could not have been more helpful, educational, and patient.  She went above and beyond to make sure our saw was registered and we had all the information we needed to be successful.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< UserId.>

i live in the north with very cold winters. To be able to set up anywhere without the mess is wonderful.  The first thing I tested was to cut very thin cuts on a 8 by 10, delicate wall tile. I was surprised at how well this saw performed.  far exceeded my best wet saw.
had to take one star off due to weight.  one man can't get it on and off the truck.</review>

The most innovative tool for the tile industry ever!  Easy to set up easy to use. Clean up is quick and clean. No pools of water or slimy tile silt to dispose of. Cutting is effortless and precise. If you dont have an IQ saw yet, what are you waiting for? Invest in your tools, invest in your company. This saw is a winner on every turn!<//Review>

<Review>I have the table top version and it’s an absolute game changer. Not only does it save time, it’s lightweight and precise. Being able to set up right next to your work and have no dust/mess is priceless. Definitely worth the money and debating on buying the big one too! Thanks iQ!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Have the tile saw, much better than any wet saw, doesn’t collect 100% of the dust. Over the years I’ve owned it, it has come out of alignment and there seems to be no way to adjust the table or head unit. Would still recommend over wetsaw</Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Time>1612373383016< /Time><Review>First of all, I would like to establish that I am a general contractor and only buy contractor grade tools. Most tools at home depot do not fit my industrial requirements.

I saw the IQ dry cut tile saw on the internet a couple years ago. I was skeptical at first because it was knew and nobody I knew owned one. Also at 2k, it’s kind of expensive.

But after I purchased it, I realized it was a game changer. I had a multi million dollar condo complex I had a project in. All the rooms including the hallways , common areas and elevators, we spotless. There was no service elevator , and we weren’t allowed to make a mess anywhere on site. So basically I bought this saw and cut inside of the room I was working in. No dust, no water, no stained carpets.

And my tile guys know.....The best part is when you hand a tile to the setter and it’s dry so the thunder actually sticks to the tile.  We use scorers too, but we do a lot of intricate cuts where the scorer is limited.

The saw is worth the 2k.</Review>< Name>

hmm Well let see... I find it hard to rate a company without having any hands on experience with any products that they make. however in this case I am willing to try.
A few months ago I was invited on a virtual tour of the company with WTI ( what tools Inside) We walked through the warehouse where they explained a lot about the company and the different products that they produce. Some of them were very interesting especially the vacuum system and the two smaller tile saws. I enjoyed it so much so that I went about town to see if I could find any of there products locally and if any of the contractors used them  but being in Canada I had no such luck , (Guess i will be stuck with a RIGID).  from the tour i have a feeling that their customer service would also be exceptional as well<//review>

I Purchased and I QT 244 tile saw one year ago. In that year and set up teardown time alone I have made my investment back,
Additionally working in Colorado through the winters it has allowed me to set up in warmer spaces… And never get my hands cold and wet.
Additionally the blade technology keeps advancing making more blades for more products.... just waiting on a blade to cut Schluter with and life will be perfect! 😂<//Review>

So I have nothing but positive to say about IQ. I purchased the IQVS362 and I love my machine. It cuts pretty quick for my liking and it need to water and makes no dust! Best for the environment and my crew. I also own the hepa vacuum. I can’t wait to see why else IQ has in store for us at WOC. Dustless equipment is a great sales pitch when selling a job. As for IQ they have hands down the best tool and customer service!!! ⚒< /review>

<text>Our company purchased our first IQMS362 a few years ago while working on a government site.  We purchased the saw for the sole purpose of controlling the amount of dust.  What we didn't know is how well it cut.  The cuts were clean and fast.  The other unexpected outcome was reduced brick stone or paver waste.  I am now able to cut my waste factor down 5%.  We have since purchased another and I anticipate purchasing future saws.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I am beyond thrilled with the service I've received from iQ Power Tools. My HEPA vac is the perfect addition to my tool collection and seems to work it's way into every one of my projects. From controlling dust while I'm mixing thinset, levelor, and grout, to dust extraction with my wood working tools, to cleaning up the jobsite when it's all done, it doesn't disappoint. Money well spent on an investment that will serve me well for years to come.< /text>

This saw is a absolute game changer for tile work especially new construction and work in the winter you can use inside the house and not worry about making a mess with the spray from a normal wet saw definitely recommend< /Text>

<Review>I think the product is overpriced for what it is. However, I have been unable to locate a similar product in the US market. Purchased the product about 3 months or so ago and it’s already showing signs of wear. Also does not perform as advertised.</Review>< Date>

<text>This place is located at the Soco Mix. Their drinks are pretty amazing. You can order on the iPad or directly with the cashier. I’ve been here a few times and their drinks never disappoint. If you’re here to hang out with friends or study/work on a laptop give this place a visit.< /text>< Pics>

I love that they have cold brew on tap. So cool. What a great spot. Gorgeous open space, friendly crew. And most of all, they are passionate about their product. Really neat guys. I wish they would have more rustic cookies and desserts rather than french pastry type stuff but that is my only thing. I will excitedly come here every time I am in Orange County,CA.</Text>

<username>Jackie Chiu< /username><Review>I've been to a few of them now, I think I can safely say that Sunright Tea Studio is definitely top tier in milk tea - this one was no exception! This one is in the middle of a indoor food plaza, so it might be a bit hard to find - just look for people waiting around for their drinks :D. Their milk tea and their Boca are both very good! Unfortunately I live in LA so I won't be able to visit this location as much, but it's good to know that Costa Mesa has an excellent milk tea spot if I'm in the area!< /Review>< Date>

Cheese cream peach oolong tea is a must ❤ make sure to get 75% sugar because it's super sweet< /Text>

I always get the house milk tea with boba because i’m too scared to branch out. Luckily the house milk tea is so good here!! They are tucked in the back of the OC Mix. You can even order ahead!< /Text>

Great boba place with good quality real taro. Their fruit teas don’t taste too artificial either. I recommend 70% sweetness for all drinks.</Text>

<Text>Really cool place, good tea, and FINALLY a place with Celyon tea, kind staff. Gotta sadly rate it 3 stars as the boba is really hard and not fresh. While the Creme Brulee topping is mainly sugar (not like other places). Low quality for what you are paying.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

one of my most fav boba places. They ppl there are literally so sweet, and their drinks aren't that expensive. They have all my fav teas and they make them perfectly. 10/10 would recommend they are pretty epic ✨<//review>

I have to admit that when I first pulled up and saw the front of this coffee spot I was unimpressed ... I was even more unimpressed by the lack of parking in front of the venue and behind in the alley. But I searched this place out on google and agreed to meet a friend here to study so there was no turning back.< /text>

Nice servers just their taro was literally the worst taro I've ever had. It was sandy and covered in honey. I tried explaining it to them but they didn't understand and wouldnt offer either a change in drink or refund without paying. Super disgusting....<//Review>

Great place..
it’s best with no sugar or 25% or less. I never liked whatever “sweets” they used. It made whatever good drink they had, bad.< /review>

<Text>(Current COVID-19 review)

So far I've been here quite a few times already. The drinks here are pretty consistent and they offer delivery and online ordering.  My constant go to drink is their Sunright Boba Milk Tea, the balance Of sweet and tea is excellent and when my gf came with me to try a fruit tea she said it was really good and their strawberry tea can rival Omomo. Lines here are usually short and workers here try to push drinks out fast, I do recommend 75% sugar since their milk tea drink can lean to be very sweet so 75% is good also ice level there is no need to adjust they don't put too much ice. I recommend this place, they do offer seating but it's closed currently due to COVID-19, and it's inside the OC mix next to Portolo Coffee. Happy boba drinking. They don't offer physical stamp cards but you can sign up for a rewards points on their iPad on the register and it'll link your card to your account, to later earn points for drinks!< /Text><user_name>Yolanda Christensen</user_name>< rating>

Sunright fruit tea 50% sugar with honey boba.... The cashier recommended 75% sweetness but at half it's still too sweet... Honey boba didn't taste fresh not sweet. Drink itself wasn't as refreshing I thought it'd be. Overall very average.< /text>

<review>Very disappointed every time I have gotten food here . And everyone is always saying it's the best. Didn't have rye for the patty melt didn't even grill the bread.. had to bring it back . That one was made right . The chili cheese fries were skimpy. And the best part I got sick and threw up in the middle of the night . Probably from onion that they grilled early that morning and had been sitting there all day ..<//review>< Pics>

<Text>The staff was VERY NICE and they were also busy.However we called a little after 5 pm to place our order. We came to pick up the food at 5 : 33 pm and we were told it was not ready.They told us to wait and it would be ready soon, we waited for almost 45 minutes!!!! We were then asked by a employee what our orders name was he then began to prepare our order.Overall,we have gone there many times and will continue on going however to wait for in total 53 minutes to get our food is simply ridiculous.</Text>< Pictures>

This place has been very hit or miss lately. My last order was chicken strips and chili cheese fries. Each chicken strip was about the size of two chicken nuggets and our chili cheese fries had almost no chili on them. I really enjoy this place but lately it hasn't been up to par. Hopefully next time will be better<//Review>

<review>Their breakfast burritos are insane. I get it with all 3 meats, and easy cheese because sometimes it's too much cheese.

I get two salsas on the side because if you ask for extra salsa inside the burrito gets a bit soggy. Their burritos are big enough to where you can eat half for breakfast, and half for lunch! They are around $8-9 and it's a great bargain. The employees are always very kind and helpful even when they are slammed and the food is top notch.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I've always wanted to try Orcutt burgers but there is no delivery so I had to ask someone to drive 5 hours to get some good bc i really wanted to try it, I heard it's named after a town but I'm not sure if it's true I got chili cheese fries a BLT zucchini fries and a regular burger. I loved the zucchini fries and chili cheese fries but I did have to microwave them bc it was 5 hours old but it's ok. It was very good but I really want delivery!!! My friends also got something they loved it.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My husband and I are new to the area and wanted a really good burger. The reviews of this place look amazing, but I tell you what... We are trying this place, not only because they have great reviews, but because of the owner's replies to the negative reviews. I can't believe how respectful, kind, and professional they are.
Not every customer will be pleased. So, of course you're going to get some negative reviews, but the INSANELY RUDE reviews are still replied to with respect and courtesy. I LOVE that!
So, with that said, 5 stars to the owner. Can't wait to see how great the burgers are!

P.S. if you're reading this after 11/17/20 and they still have 5 stars, their burgers are awesome and you should try them!

Edited 1/3/2: Could you please update your hours of operation? I showed up 15 minutes before you're supposed to close and the place was shut down and employees were leaving.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Got a patty melt, fries, and a shake.

Patty Melt and shake were about on par, nothing exceptional. Melt had pretty flavorless pickles and what tasted like kraft singles for cheese.

French fries were good!</Text></record>

They gave me tartar sauce for my gyro instead of tzatziki and I ordered fries they didn’t give me. Check your order before leaving! I called when I got home and realized it and they just said they would tell the manager. I won’t be going back.</review>

I went through the drive thru yesterday. They gave me a leaky cup twice. Then forgot the ranch that they charged me for. Needless to say I didn't leave a tip. But when I checked my bank account they gave themselves a $5 tip. I am very ashamed with this selfish unprofessional behavior. How dare you take it upon yourself to charge me. The food is already expensive. I was already spending $25 for two burritos and a half order of biscuits and gravy which wasn't worth the money in my opinion. I have lived in orcutt for over 16 years and have come here with my family for a very long time. I hope this isnt something that happens to everyone. But I recommend if you go here and pay with a card to check you bank statements. Going to talk to the manager today< /review>

The hamburgers were like old fashioned burgers you would get when you were a kid. From a Mom and Pop hamburgers stand. The fries, zucchini and mushrooms were excellent. But most importantly the staff was extremely friendly and cooked our order perfectly.</Review>

< Review>
I came home from work tired and hungry... decided to skip on cooking and have a cheeseburger. Placed order for all my family, repeated a few times my order to make sure I get what I want ( in the past I had my order messed up). And this time too... it was messed up. I was even more disappointed after communication with Manager who was unprofessional and actually rude. She offered me to come back and get missing items.. seriously? So, unfortunately I had my ruined dinner and unpleasant experience with Orcutt Burger :( Advice: make sure to check your bags/ orders before you leave restaurant.</Review>

Orcutt Burger was a surprisingly great place for a traditional American breakfast! The prices and service were good and the servings were a good size.  The menu is extensive enough to get a different kind of omelet every week! I had perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs that came with two good sized sausage patties, hashbrowns, and toast.< /Text>

Classically delicious flavors, simple menu with avocado addition available. Fried zuchhini substitution was a no brainier. Staff was relaxed, helpful, and food came out quick. 4/5 definitely coming back. Minus one star for table crumbs and soft drink choices.<//Review>

< Review>
Their overall menu is just what anyone can expect of a burger joint. Yet, unlike most other restaurants, they seem terrified of seasonings. There's no distinctive flavors! 😖

For example, all of their fried food (fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, french fries, fried onion rings, etc) tastes only of one thing -- fry oil 🤢. Their beef burger patties lack flavor, except for just the faint hints of salt and pepper. But even then, their burgers taste just like any unseasoned beef would.

Surprisingly though, I think the gyro is their best item on the menu (super strange for a burger restaurant that also has "Burger" in its name). Their gyro meat is fairly well seasoned with traditional Greek seasonings. I've wondered about this question for a long time though: why is it only topped with lettuce and white onion, and not with the traditional gyro toppings of lettuce, diced tomatoes, and *red* onion? (White onion? Really?) It's disgusting with it. The flavor profile of white onions completely clash with the flavor profiles in the gyro. This is because white onions have the strongest flavor out of all the other onion varieties; which is why they're perfect in Mexican food. Red onions on the other hand, are the best to use on gyros, because they are milder and slightly sweeter in flavor, which provides a really nice balance to the overall flavor of the gyro.

It just seems to me that the restaurant badly needs someone who is more qualified to oversee all of the food related decisions, than that of the current person performing this function. It would also be a huge bonus if this knew someone new enough about the flavor profiles of foods, because that knowledge can be used to promote and improve the restaurant's overall food quality.<//Review>

As good a burger as you will find anywhere in the area, period,
and I don't know of any other place that is so generous with the fries.

The pastrami is good, too.

Add to that a high standard of service, and Orcutt Burger is unbeatable.

Of course, such quality and care command a higher price than
you will pay elsewhere, but in this case the difference is well worth it.</Review>

Great, reliable flavors. Chili fries are a fantastic choice here, huge portion, very sharable and taste awesome. Burgers are a bit on the plain side but quite fresh. Leaves something to be desired but overall a great place to eat and overall better than its Santa Maria bretheren.< /Text>

Hello
🙄I ordered a chef salad and to my surprising disappointment it had shrunk. I mean dang even the eggs the cucumber was sliced so thin. The TOMATOES  dang almost where see through. Cheese  what cheese,🤔Seriously what a disappointment  OhAnd to top it off the chicken and ham where  cut into babie size pieces with a baby handful  of  each. Man it was a total bummer. Oh oh and they  used to put a few little slices of red onion  and now  nada....oh The absolute worst thing is the PRICE THEY CHARGE THE SAME PRICE FOR THIS SALAD. THIS NEW OWNER IS SUPPER FRUGAL  DUDE ITS GOING TO COST YOU LOYAL CUSTOMERS. 🙄SORRY FOR BEING SO NEGATIVE NANCY. GUST STATING MY FACTS.  TY<//Review>

Was better years a go, but still good food. They should fix the holes in the ceiling and stop charging extra for a side of BBQ sauce to go with onion rings. Not as good as value as it use to be.</review>

<Review>It's a little pricier than regular fast food burger places, but it's soooooo worth it! Both the quality and the quantity of the food are far above their competitors. Oh, and here's a pro tip: when ordering the pastrami sandwich, treat it like a team sport. It's freaking HUGE!<//Review>< Pics>

Their pastrami sandwich is the best around, the onion rings are large and crunchy, not greasy, and their fries a Burgers are better than others who claim to be the best burgers around. I won't print their names because some do have decent burgers but the flavor and quality of the meat and veggies just don't top Orcutt Burgers!! The size of their pastrami sandwiches is at least 1 pound!!< /Text>

Cruised in to grab some quick breakfast, and was happily surprised to find they had sit down table service.  Breakfast was really good.  Chicken fried steak was in the running  for the best around!  Gravy was delicious.   Pancakes are really good. Omelettes are 4 eggs.  Very reasonable prices too</Text>

Solid go to for quick breakfast, lunch or dinner. They've been established here for a while and haven't lost a beat.  Only wish they'd change choice of lettuce, other than very nice place.<//review>

<Text>The best burger in Orcutt. French fries, onion rings, and yes the zucchini strips all complimented our excellent burger. Quick service and friendly. A great place to get filled up with good food.< /Text>< user_id>

All American burger joint with great customer service and a HUGE menu with plenty of items you won't find at chain fast food places. My favorites include the BLT sando, avocado bacon burger and... oh yeah, the BEST zucchini fries on the central coast! I swear the ranch they serve with it is homemade.</Text>

It's hard to go wrong ordering a burger here during lunch/dinner. They are big and always good. I like to go during breakfast and get a breakfast burrito. They are HUGE usually lasts me 2-3 days for breakfast. They also have chili cheese fries and zucchini fries as a side. Customer service is decent, nothing special. It was recently remodeled so it looks pretty nice, especially for a burger joint.< /text>

it's about 3.00 More than the average fast food chain but the quality is more than worth it. Try the fried zucchini instead of French fries they are awesome! It is local family owned business. They branched off and there was a Santa Maria Burger but I don't know if it's still around.<//Review>

After not going to this place for years I finally was in town and had the chance to go. The wait staff was very nice and extremely helpful. How ever it just wasn't as good as it used to be. The burgers were bland and fries unsalted and unseasoned. The prices were outrageous as well paid $25 for two meals. Was very disappointed in what used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Orcutt.< /Review>

Orcutt burger is amazing and should open a restaurant in Goleta. I've not had dinner there but their breakfast items are great and I e had burgers for lunch before. While I'm not a fan of breakfast burritos in general I do know that they're really good because I'd eat the ones there.< /Text>

<text>Had my first and last pastrami sandwich at the Grover location!  10 bucks for very close to the worst pastrami I have ever had.  No flavor and fatty tough meat with very little mustard or pickles.  Plus waited 20 minutes in drive thru with 3 cars in line!  I live in Orcutt and have noticed quality going down as price goes up.

<review>The food is good here. However, when I was here there were several tables with dirty dishes and trash/food debris under others. It looked like it hadn't been swept all day. If you are in town and craving a burger, this is a good place. So long as you don't mind a little mess with your meal.<//review><Time>1503013949103</Time>< response>

It's usually really good, but this time the breakfast gravy was watery and bland.  Points for trying to make it better by adding bacon, but it was way overpriced for bad gravy.</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>I use to love this place but it's really pricy and not worth it anymore. Plus the burgers are meh. When you get an order to go, the sides are smaller portion then when you sit in at the same price. My favorite thing was the zucchini fries and now it's a total rip off you get a tiny little bag. Not worth it. Only gave it 2 stars because the breakfast is decent sometimes. If they change the Zucchini fries back maybe I'd go again. Until then I'll drive out of my way to get a burger at Charlies.</Text>< pics>

<text>Drove from Santa Maria to Orcutt for Orcutt Burger under the justification that it's always been better than Santa Maria burger since ownership changed and I was very disappointed.
The patty to my burger was incredibly dry, like it had been out for a while, and completely wrecked my stomach afterwards. The fries were pretty stale too. The quality has really changed and so has the customer service, bummer.</text><Gmap_id>0x80ec139a08084543:0x10c57da42d2c4e6b</Gmap_id><response>None</response><user>101816936086675997267<//user>< Rating>

<Text>Better Than In & Out Burger! Ok, this place has the best burgers I have had in my entire life! Great grilled flavor and a nice size. Totally a hidden gem in Santa Maria, also try the fried zucchini strips. They give you a huge plate full! You won't be disappointed!</Text>< pictures>

I use to love this place but it's really pricy and not worth it anymore. Plus the burgers are meh. When you get an order to go, the sides are smaller portion then when you sit in at the same price. My favorite thing was the zucchini fries and now it's a total rip off you get a tiny little bag. Not worth it. Only gave it 2 stars because the breakfast is decent sometimes. If they change the Zucchini fries back maybe I'd go again. Until then I'll drive out of my way to get a burger at Charlies.</Review>

<review>I ate here two yrs ago and never went back. Got very sick to my stomach after eating their broiled chicken sandwich. They have two major problems. First, they “pre cook” the frozen burger patties and the chicken breasts and then stack them up on a open plate and leave them there until you  place an order . Then when you order a burger they will take one of those half cooked burger patties from that open plate, throw it back on the grill, warming it up a little bit and use that to make you a burger. they do the same thing with the chicken breast.
They basically don’t use proper food handling and you can get food that has been contaminated.  I contacted the Health Dep and they did an investigation and found them to be in violations of food handling practices.
Their other big problem is the employees that You see in the back door smoking while taking a break and you’re ordering your food then you go pick up your food and you noticed that employee just walked in and did not wash their hands and continued to cook after smoking outside and playing with their cell phone.  Poorly run fast food restaurant. Has been thru two owners now and things still are ran the same way. I don’t recommend unless if you want a real cheap burger made with real cheap frozen meat that is then not handled right.

In response to them saying they only source from the best, Sorry , but all you have to do is Taste the meat patty you sell By Itself and then tell me it doesn’t taste cheap!!! You use real cheap frozen meat patty’s that look like the ones they sell at smart and final in frozen stacks.  You should taste a Mel’s classic burger to learn what a Real Good burger should taste like. On Highland Ave, Hollywood, CA<//review>< Pictures>

Grease.  Lots and lots of dripping grease!  On top of that... They tracked my cell phone and I got an email: "At Orcutt Burger?"
I feel poisoned, in need of some strong soap and water and that my personal space has been invaded.  What other information did you glean fro my phone?  Changing all privacy settings now.  Geesh, way way too aggressive!< /text>

<Review>Had lunch there today, ordered #1 hamburger meal like I have a thousand times before. I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the new bun being used. For some reason the hamburger doesn't taste the same. I think the bun is to fat and I can't taste the burger like before. Hopefully Im  not the only one to notice. Please go back to the way it was before. I know change is good for somethings, but I think changing the burger bun was mistake< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ec139a08084543:0x10c57da42d2c4e6b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ok burgers.  Floor and quite often tables need cleaning.  Over easy eggs are like bricks, hash browns and toast burnt!  I've had it with poor food not even close to how ordered.  Go elsewhere.</text>

Was so excited to finally get to try their biscuits & gravy! Boy was I disappointed when I took my first bite. There was so much gravy my biscuits were super soggy, then there gravy was terrible. It's a bacon gravy with ZERO flavor. My recommendation is to stick to the hamburger at least they nailed that!</text>

< review>
I hate to give a poor review however the owner did not care to talk to my wife and I. We asked to speak with him  and the cashier said that he was busy cooking. We said that was okay and we would wait until he had a minute. We saw him walk out the door 45 minutes later!

The reason we wanted to speak with him was because he did not have any wheelchair seating and we thought that we should point out that it was needed. When we placed our order we asked if they had a table that we could sit at with a wheelchair and the cashier said just pull it up to one of the booths and it will work. I started to explain that it would not work very well but she did not seem to care. When she brought out the food I asked to speak with the owner or manger and then she volunteered a table in the corner under the TV. It was full of booster seats and news papers. She said that she would clear if off for us if we wanted. At that point we were already making the booth work so we told her to just have the owner see us when he got caught up.

My wife and I do not want to sit over in a corner under a TV. Also before her injury we would often go to Orcutt Burger with a group, now due to the seating we are forced to go somewhere that has wheelchair seating.

The cost to fix a few of the tables so that you could pull a wheelchair up would be very little. Likely less then $500!

I am not sure however I think that they are in violation of some ADA laws! We would like to shop local however if we cannot get access then we are forced to go elsewhere.<//review>

I went to Orcutt Burger last night for the first time and I was not impressed!! I ordered double bacon cheese burger, zucchini, and a large pepsi and all i ended up with was the cheese burger.  They did not have anymore zucchini left so i ended up with onion rings which were burnt!  When I recieved the order they forgot my pepsi.  The girls working were rude and not friendly!! The next day I complained to the manager Lisa and she remade my order, but she was a little rude also.  I was told this was a good place to eat and I think I was lied too!!<//Review>

My chicken sandwich was so incredibly dry I couldn't even take a bite. My teeth couldn't go through the chicken breast. It was horrible. I cannot believe I paid for this, let alone paid way more for it then any other fast food chicken sandwich I've ever had.< /review>

<Review>Prices have gone up slowly over the years, but the quality of the burgers is definitely worth it. Their breakfast burritos are still a bargain in my opinion. Don't see why the nearby McDonald's is still open with Orcutt burger there. Only downside is there's not enough seating, especially in the mornings on weekends.</Review>< pics>

if you happen to like fried zucchini, but you never had fried zucchini from Orcutt Burger, then you need to get in your car right now and drive on down to Orcutt Burger and get some fried zucchini.  Trust me, you'll thank me later. No other place on the Central Coast makes fried zucchini as good as they do.<//Review>

Not enough space coupled with an inherently longer food prep time leads to frequent traffic jams and long waits in the parking lot. Just plan to order inside, it's worth it.<//text>< gmap_id>

Not as good as it used to be, the staff isn't as friendly and the once delicious fried zucchini is becoming mediocre. Cheeseburgers are still bomb though< /Review>

< Review>
would like to start off by saying the food is great. If I could give 5 stars for food only, I would. The 1 star review is based off of service only. I haven't even ate my meal yet as I am flabbergasted by the type of service I received this evening and generally lost my appetite.
I've lived in orcutt for 15 years. I've been going to Orcutt burger since I can remember.. The food is amazing, but my god, their staff is completely inept. They get the order wrong 9 times out of 10 and do not care about their mistakes.. I always let it slide because it's usually taken care of by upper management.
Seriously, it is probably best to eat inside as that way you can check to see if your meal is correct right away. But I always check the bag when going through the drive-thru.
I checked the bag as I always do, and noticed that my fries did not have any seasoning, that I specifically asked for.. The short haired blonde girl "did not have a name tag and I only have server #18 'Heaven' on my receipt" took the order to fix their mistake and then handed it back to me within ten seconds.. I was curious that it took a short time to rectify the order, but I THOUGHT it was taken care of. So I pulled to the parking lot to double check, and low and behold. All they did was dump seasoning into the top of my bag and call it a day..
They literally just did enough on top to get me out of the drive thru. I was tempted to go back and ask what in the world was going on with their service, but obviously I will not be getting help from any of their staff on hand this evening.
It's not the lack of seasoning I'm upset about. I'm upset about the complete disregard to fix their own mistake.
I only made this account to post this. I was completely floored by the lack of consideration coming from the server this evening.</Review>
